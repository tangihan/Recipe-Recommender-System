I spoke with MsTart prior to making this recipe as I wanted to try making it gluten-free. I used the following: 1 cup brown rice flour, 1 cup white rice flour, 1 cup potato flour, and 3 1/2 cups GF baking flour. I also added 2 teaspoons xanthum gum, and the other ingredients as written. The dough came out nicely and I made 1 loaf after th initial prove. It was rather small (about 6 inches long/4 inches wide) and I baked using the boiling hot water in the preheated oven. The loaf had a wonderful crust but was not done inside ~ still doughy. I did taste test it and the flavor was good, it just wasn't done. I will make another loaf tomorrow, cutting the temperature to 400 and not kneading as much. I'm convinced this is the perfect recipe for my gluten-free bread craving, I just have to figure out what the adjustments are that I need to make. I've never baked any kind of bread other than quick-bread (cake-like) breads, so this is ALL new to me. Will update this review tomorrow.

63712,the ultimate lemon meringue pie,39,15,100,476.3,33.0,165.0,10.0,12.0,52.0,21.0,352538,2010-05-31,"Sorry, but this just didn't work for me.  The crust was good, the meringue lovely (I used all 6 egg whites and adjusted the sugar etc to compensate).  The problem was with the ingredients and method of making the filling, I think.  I have only made LMP a few times and always used a recipe that had a lemon curd type of filling.  Never a problem with runny filling or flavourless filling.  Due to the rave reviews I thought I'd try this to see what I was missing.  My first question was about adding so much water to the filling ingredients.  I noticed many LMP recipes use a water and cornstarch based filling which seems to provide much less flavour than one using mostly or all lemon juice for the filling.  I also didn't understand adding unbeaten egg yolks to all that sugar and cornstarch.  That seems like asking for trouble along the lines of little bits of tough egg floating in the filling.  Why not combine the water and beaten egg yolks or even a little water and egg yolks?  Or add some of the cold water to the sugar and cornstarch, then add the rest to the yolks and combine?  It would prevent egg lumps that one reviewer said she dealt with by using an immersion blender.  Then the cooking instructions seem backwards.  They say to cook the sugar, cornstarch, yolks and water ""until thickened"", then add the lemon juice, rind and butter.  I did cook the sugar mixture until very thick (like icing or heavy  custard) but once I added the juice and the butter it became pourable and never thickened up again.  The pie has been in the fridge for 24 hours and the filling is still the consistency of melted ice cream.  Why not cook the filling with the butter and lemon juice in it so you can accurately judge the consistency?  Did I cook it too long?  Not long enough?  There is no real way to know.  The taste is okay but not special even using fresh lemon juice, sweeter today than yesterday we all agreed, and the meringue did not weep at all.  It looked lovely until we cut it and it poured itself out of its crust.  IMHO, just not worth the effort given the ease by which one can make a real lemon curd for such a pie and avoid the issue of ""will it or wont it"" thicken.",3

Made as directed, including using the cast iron skillet, but didn't have any hamburger buns so I toasted some bread.  I learned a little trick from Zaar Chef Evelyn/Athens about browning ground meat and it's the only way I do it now.  When you think it's brown enough, cook another 5 minutes.  When you think that's done, brown another 1-2 minutes.  It gets the meat so carmelized and tastey, just like the crispy edges of a real diner burger.

This left a sweet and spicy liquid mixture to baste on them. I used only 1 tbsp chili powder but added the 1/2 tsp cayenne and also seasoned with fresh ground black pepper after I wrapped. I also flipped them halfway through cooking (total time 45 mins) I did some on the broiler and should have made sure to also put the foil on bottom part not just the upper pan (thats okay, DD will be doing the cleanup!!) I also had too many to fit on the broiler pan so I used a small pan that I lined with foil. This produced a blackened foil but a nice carmelization on the bacon (as long as you catch it early enough so the burnt smell does not permeate the wraps) Will try this again using some of the other suggestions of variation on spices. She will have to reheat so hoping they are as good as fresh out of the oven....my reward for doing the cooking!!",5

I used canned chickpeas to get around the chickpea problem from the previous poster.   (Dried ones are often iffy in final quality.)   I stirred some (1 tsp.) of the pickle in it, but not much because that stuff is really hot and strong.  Worried about DH not liking it.  So I set some on the side for me.  This is kinda a bland dish (which was great for him); good to spice it up with the pickle for me.  I went back and made the Ras El Hanout mentioned in the introduction and then served the whole thing over mashed potatoes.   I used 2 tsp. of the spice mix since I'd already put in the other spices when originally cooked.  This time, it was much better for me but overly spiced for my husband.   ZWT6",4

5 for flavor, but I did have to alter it to my tastes.

But a great dish, and I loved them baked.

I did use a good salsa. I do love spice, lots of it, but I cut back on the cumin and oregano.  However, I used a very flavorful good salsa, a more plain salsa or picante may require more seasoning. My salsa was a ""more gourmet blend,"" so it had lots of seasoning already.

I did use a Mexican blend of cheeses too.

My garnish was simple a green enchilada sauce, sour cream and diced olives.

If I was home I may of served over a bed of lettuce with some fresh diced tomatoes and scallions, but I was at work (making it for co workers) so I didn't get that fancy.

I did spray with olive oil vs margarine, and they turned out golden brown.

It was easy, great taste, much healthier and I enjoyed them.  Very very good.

Black beans would be another good addition to them, but the chicken and salsa was perfect.

Thx for a great easy quick recipe.

Being out of Taco seasoning tonight, I used this recipe as a substitute and my DH, who never says much, came to tell me that although he always likes this meal, something was different and it was just over the top!  There could never be a better review -- so much for store bought Taco seasoning mix.  This only took minutes to throw together and totally an already very good meal to the exceptional level.  This seasoning is made quickly with ingredients most of us already have on hand.  High five Kitten!!",5

I like my meal proportions to lean heavily to vegetables, so that wasn't the problem.  I think this recipe works best with tastily-spiced leftovers, not starting with unseasoned fresh ingredients.  Still, what I made was good enough to eat, and tasty enough to try variations on it later.  Cheese on the bottom ended up a lot like crust ...

I made them on my new George Foreman grill that came with waffle plates and they cooked up wonderfully. They didn't stick (I don't know if that had to do with the recipe or the non-stick spray I used), the outside got nice & golden brown and just a tad crusty while the inside was oh so soft-  just like we like them!  The kids loved them and hubby even ate 2 (which was a surprise.) <br/><br/>I used what I had on hand for the recipe- which was 2% milk & only vanilla extract. (I'm definitely going to pick some up for next time b/c I have a feeling it'll make it a five-star recipe then!) I also added a few dashes of cinnamon to the dry ingrediants. The batter was really lumpy which worried me, but after I cooked them it didn't make a difference. This recipe made 6 big waffles on my George Foreman G5 grill.<br/><br/>I think next time I'm going to try and make it healthier by using some wheat flour & possibly wheat germ or flax seed.

I do see why this recipe garners so many high reviews, though.  It is nice to be able to mix and bake everything all in one pan.  I also see the advantage of this recipe for those who can't/won't eat eggs or milk.  And I didn't note any odd taste, as some other reviewers have noted.  I didn't taste the vinegar or baking soda at all in this.  The cake is good for a quick and easy dessert at home, but if I need something to serve to guests or to take to friends, I will use one of my other recipes that yields a better result (with slightly more work and clean-up).",3

Boiling them in water, then broiling them in the oven sounded unusual, but I thought what the heck lets try!  I could not believe the end result!  They came out plump and crispy on the outside.  Everytime I would make baked wings, they always seemed to shribble up and never would crisp up very well on the outside.  I tried several different methods and recipes and it always was the same.  Not this recipe!  I was so surprised that a baked wing recipe could compare so close to the fried ones.  Absolutely the best, and I will always use this recipe from now on when I want to bake them.

The very, very middle of the cake was very soft but I couldn't leave it in any longer or the top would have developed cracks. I suggest adding a dash of salt to the cream cheese frosting.  This is a winner of a recipe.",5

I usually use the recipe on the back of the Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chip bag, but have been looking for something different.  These definitely are thick, soft, and chewy, but the taste is seriously lacking to me.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a 1 1/2 T. measure instead of a 2 T.  I ended up getting 50 cookies even out of this, but they have such an aftertaste of shortening that I really don't even want to eat them.  I'll probably end up sending them to work with my husband and let his coworkers eat them because they won't get eaten here.  4 stars for such a great texture, but 2 for the flavor...evening out at 3.",3

I followed the recipe for the sauce and the only change I made was to add about 4 cloves of chopped garlic and rather than cooking it in the crock pot I baked it in the oven at 325 for about 4 hours. Because of a family dislike of large chunks of tomatoes I chose to puree the sauce in the blender before serving and found it was perfectly thick enough that I didn't need to add corn starch.  The whole family gave it 2 thumbs up and even better requested it to be made again.,5

It has good texture (not watery at all) and when the vegetables are hand cut, makes a nice, thick, chunky salsa. Pace has nothing on this stuff! :)<br/><br/>However, in doing some research I found this same recipe on two other sites and both had the notation that if you are pressure canning, use 1/3 cup of vinegar, however, if you are only doing the hot water bath, vinegar needs to be upped to 1 cup for safety reasons. Recipes found on various canning sites also call for much more vinegar in relation to the same amount of tomatoes. I just question the safety of this when just using a hot water bath as opposed to pressure canning. I am going to uncan and refreeze this batch just to be on the safe side.",0

We thought the flavor was good, once they were cooked - mine looked horrid, haha - but my husband said he thought they had a weird aftertaste (I'm assuming that was from the baking soda).

My red potatoes and carrots were perfectly cooked as well. I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom and Garlic soup but might try Golden Mushroom next time. I knew I wouldn't feel like making a gravy if the soup was too thin for me when I got home so I just bought the thicker soup.",5

Great over spanish/mexican rice also.  <br/><br/>Just a note to those who couldn't locate the Land o' Lakes brand of white american--any white american cheese sold at your deli counter will work.  Same place you buy fresh sliced lunch meat.  American cheese melts better than cheddars and jacks which can get oily, stringy and grainy.  You can make it using cheddars but then you really need to stand by and stir often and keep and eye on it.   Cheddars are also stronger in flavor which will change the end result of this dip's taste.",5

I think I'll make this again and add salt, pepper, double the clams (he said the clam flavor wasn't very strong) and use fewer potatoes. There wasn't enough clam juice to boil the potatoes so I had to add water, and I think that is where the blandness came from.

I wasn't really sure how much to season the flour, but I added season salt to the flour and also added some of Paula Deen's House seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder) directly to the steaks before dipping them.  I actually didn't measure anything for either the steaks or the gravy, just estimated as I had cut it down to make 2 steaks.  It made a good amount of gravy, but we ended up eating pretty much all of it between the steaks and mashed potatoes.  Thanks for helping make my first frying experience a good one!",4

I also like to add freshly grated ginger for tummy aches or two garlic chunks for colds. (I take the garlic out after 4 minutes) This tastes very good and definitely has benefits for the look of the skin over time as it cleans the liver. Like other reviewers I feel a need to stress the importance of using a good quality local organic honey, ie not from the regular grocers! The best honey is local to wherever we live  because it helps with allergies and organic without additives. I do add more honey per preference and leave about 10 minutes with a small plate over top to keep hot and I find it has more lemon flavour which we like. I was originally debating 4 stars because I had a regular non-local honey to use. I find it doesn't taste as good as the local organic ones and more than once I felt it gives me a slight allergic reaction (non-local honey that is). Also the quality of water used is important as well. City treated water with tons of chemicals and hormones is a NO-NO for your health. I had used distilled water and would have preferred spring water. Since then I only use spring water. I never use a 1 inch slice of lemon as that is too thick. I tried it that way and it wasn't as good plus it wastes the lemon. I use about 1/4 inch slice. Oh and don't forget to wash the lemon before cutting it. A definite make over and over drink.

Once cooked I lifted the chicken out, in sections removed the skin & deboned it and served it rustic style on a platter accompanied by roasted carrots, parsnip & potatoes. The gravy is fantastic. I stuffed the cavity with quartered onions. YUM!",5

It tasted good and was super simple to make.  This method of making ""fried"" eggplant cutlets was easier, less mess and obviously healthier.  I would recommend letting the eggplant rest on the pan for at least 10-15 minutes once it has come out of the oven. All in all, a very good alternative to the traditional preparation, especially for those who are health conscious or are looking to spend less time and fuss in the kitchen.  <br/><br/>However (based on my own family's taste), for making Eggplant Parmigiana or for crispy cutlets that can be handled or eaten immediately after cooking, these cutlets just can't hold up.  Traditional pan-fried cutlets have a taste and texture that can't be beat BUT are not as healthy as this recipe.  The texture of this preparation doesn't seem quite cooked through even though it definitely is.  Pan-fried eggplant has a crunchy outer coating and an almost creamy interior.   This recipe produces a whole different ""mouth feel"" than pan-fried eggplant.  When using these eggplant cutlets in Eggplant Parm or any layered application, compared to the pan-fried version, these have a ""raw"" taste to the breadcrumbs and make for a sandy texture because the crumbs absorb all of the moisture in the sauce.  You will need to have extra sauce on the side.  I increased my sauce in an Eggplant Parm recipe by 50% and it still needed sauce on the side.  The breadcrumbs can't hold up to the sauce like fried cutlets can.   <br/><br/>If you remove the skin from eggplant before cooking, as many Italian-American traditional recipes do, cut your eggplant at least 1/2"" thick or your cutlets will fall apart when oven-fried.<br/><br/>This was a good recipe.

It can take a bit of time to get the dough to fully come together; I find that it needs more milk and/or oil than called for, otherwise it's really crumbly and cracks easily if it's too dry. The texture of the dough seems weird when handling, but after baking, it's wonderful. I always cut down the amount of salt (and usually the sugar) because I find it too salty otherwise.

I removed the pork, shredded it, bagged it and threw it in the fridge.  I discarded the cooking liquid.  The day I needed it (I was cooking ahead for my daughter's birthday party) I tossed it back in the crockpot and mixed in the barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's).

I did make some changes. I had 2 1/2 lbs scallops and looking at the amount of cracker crumbs, I knew it would of been too much for just 2 lbs. But considering the extra 1/2 lb, I stuck to the cracker crumbs amount, but still cut back on the butter amount.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are key, and dry if possible. If you can't get dry fresh scallops, make sure to dry completely on a paper towel before using. This will help avoid extra moisture which some mentioned.<br/><br/>Next, I did use fresh thyme and plenty of pepper and some sea salt.<br/><br/>I mixed the cracker crumbs with the butter, only 1/3 cup, not 1/2 as stated and then topped the scallops.  I felt there was less butter in the buttermilk at the bottom.<br/><br/>Also, I think it is important to get a pan that fits how many scallops you have.  This way the crumbs stay on top vs the bottom of the pan.  Mine turned out crunchy after 20 minutes at 425.  I cooked them a bit hotter, but I had very very large scallops.<br/><br/>It was not my favorite dish as I couldn't taste just the scallops, but for those who like more sauce or seasoning on their seafood, I think it was very good.<br/><br/>But I think there are a few tricks to dish for a successful dish",4

I layered the dish as follows, half of the potatoes, sprinkled with half of the shredded cheese, and add all of the meat.Added  the remaining potatoes, covered with foil and baked at 375 degrees for 1 hour.

I gave a big scoop of this to my Dad who always skips the Spanish rice and he ate the entire thing, raving about how good it was the entire time. Even the babies loved this rice as it is not hugely spicy. Easy and delicious means this recipe will become a regular in our family! November 8, 2010: I have tried other Quick Spanish Rice recipes but NONE as good as this one and it continues to be my ""go to"" recipe for Spanish Rice. I now start with 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil and saute the rice first which <br/>keeps the grains separate and prevents the rice from sticking to the pan. Then add the rest of the ingredients and follow the directions. Try this rice.... you'll love it!",0

Frosted with chocolate whipped cream frosting (tastes like ice cream with your cake) He came home and actually used the word ""phenomenal""!! His boss tried to steal the left overs and sneak home lol But I managed to get a piece. Used strong coffee for the water - that was my only alteration.

I made a variation on the bacon-wrapped jalapeno idea, and filled mine with 10 pieces of crumbled bacon, about 3 oz (from 4 oz can) diced jalapenos, and I used neufchatel cheese (low-fat cream cheese). I couldn't find the crescent roll tube size called for, but I got 48 (exactly, using all my filling) from two 8 oz crescent roll tubes, and I cut the rolls into 3 pieces each. This probably took me about the same amount of time as the bacon-wrapped jalapenos (although it was much cleaner), and it was nice to try a different variation of those. I can see using this idea with many other fillings too. Personally, I thought the bread part overpowered the filling part, but people at the party seemed to like them. Robust-tasting filling ingredients would work really good in this recipe, I think. Thanks for the idea.",4

A very simple and tasty recipe, I made this often when I have to work late for my husband and 3 year old.  I used dry onion powder vs regular onion, added pepper, garlic powder, dry mustard and a shot of Tabasco also, cooking with the flour. I also added a 1oz block of Velveeta light with the sharp cheddar I used for extra creaminess.  Noodles were added raw.   For those complaining it is too floury, be sure to cook your flour/spice/milk mix really well, that eliminates most of the floury taste.

At first I was weirded out that my kitchen smelled more like apple pie than turkey during the first 1-2 hours of baking.  It took 4.5-5 hours of baking at 325 to make a 14 lb turkey.

I tried the roaster bag for the brine as someone on the boards suggested but it burst and the brine leaked out.  So I transferred it to a 5 gallon bucket.  So, do not use the bags!

The second time I added 4 oz cream cheese (for half recipe) to harden the filling a bit and reduced white sugar by 2 tbsp. I also increased the spice: 1/4 tsp of clove and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. However, I didn't reduce salt and the filling turn a little too salty (there must be some salt in the cream cheese too: I used Lucern).

I did however, use 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter, and 1/2 creamy peanut butter, plus I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the recipe. I actually whipped up the cookie dough in the morning, then baked the cookies later in the evening, which the dough held together nicely. I used a small Pampered Chef Scoop, which is equal to 1-tablespoon, to help round out the cookies. I baked the cookies on a Pampered Chef Baking Stone for excatly 12 minutes, then let them set on the baking stone for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool. I found I got 28 (2-inch) cookies form this recipe. I couldn't believe how good these cookies turned out, as I was a skeptic at first, and wondered how one could make cookies with out adding flour to the mix. Well, I'm no longer a skeptic, and 'am glad I tried making these flourless cookies, as they were very good, but I would definitely chill the cookie dough for several hours before baking them. One more thing, I did take another viewers advice about rolling some of the cookies in brown sugar before baking them, as they stated it gave the cookies a toffee taste to them. I baked half the cookies that way, but felt the cookie lost the peanut butter taste in the process. My husband and I prefered the cookies with out rolling them in any sugar, and since I chilled the cookie dough for most of the day, applying a criss-cross pattern to the top of the cookie with a fork, was easy and I had no problems with that. Thank you Mysterygirl, for posting this recipe. It definitely is a keeper!",5

Everyone who tried it was in agreement that the soup was good, but maybe not great.  That could just be a taste preference.  My only complaint about the recipe was that my sausage was not done after 30 min at 300, but maybe thats just the type of sausage I was using?  I had to turn up the temp and cook for nearly a half hour longer than directed.  I also felt there was maybe too much sausage called for.  I cooked 1 lb (5 or 6 links) but ended up leaving out one of them because I thought it would be too much. Honestly though, I think it's mostly preference, I don't like sausage that much to begin with so that could be the problem.  It was fun to try something new though!",4

I have another ranch chicken recipe, but it takes 3 times as long to make and uses bone-in chicken, which some of my family members don't like. This one is not quite as good, but it is ""good enough"" and I can certainly see myself making this one far more often. The only problem I had was that I ran out of breadcrumbs. Next time I would double the breadcrumb mixture. I used 1/3 c. of cheese (cotijo instead of parmesan, but it is essentially the same) and 1 tsp. each of pepper and garlic powder. I actually had plenty of dressing. I cooked this on a rack in a half-sheet pan to try to make it more crispy. It still was not particularly crispy (maybe due to the lack of crumbs) so next time I might actually cook it straight on foil in the half-sheet to ease cleanup. I wouldn't use a smaller pan, though. I served this with Recipe #72735 and Recipe #321880.",4

I love brussel sprouts, but hate it when they are soggy.  I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and just love the way the outer leaves get nice and brown, and the inner part stays a little bit crispy.  I used 20 sprouts and couldn't fit them all in the pan cut side down, so I did it that way with as many as would fit, then just threw the rest of them in on top.  They eventually all got browned and I left the garlic in the pan - love it when it gets all carmelized!

Loved the flavor, but I think it would be even better if I let it sit overnight, so I'm thinking that next time (probably later this week) I'll do a double or triple batch of the broth, then freeze half of it and other half in the fridge overnight.  We'll definitely be making this a lot in the future!  Thank you for posting!",5

After I did the second stage cooking  I took the chicken out of the pan and kept warm and then cooked the sauce till it caramelized then re-added the chicken and mixed then served. This worked out perfectly, with the chicken having a nice crispiness to it. I give this recipe high praises and will do this restaurant quality recipe again.

And I didn't add the crystallized ginger, but would of. It just - it worth going to the store for just the garnish. If I had company I would of, and I know it would of been very good.<br/><br/>1 change and 1 suggestion.<br/>- I did add a bit of cilantro for a little color and a bright flavor with the rich coconut milk.  Just 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I enjoyed the bright flavor.<br/>- I would of added maybe just a scallion diced, but didn't have any. Just a bit of fresh bright green color to me is all I needed.<br/><br/>Second, I followed cooking directions for the rice that was on my package. I used basmati. I checked my long grain, basmati and jasmine and they all had different times, so I think maybe that is why people said it took longer to cook.  My package direction said 25 and that is just about how long it took.<br/><br/>I think it is just common sense to check. Not all stoves or pots cook the same. As is no rice directions are the same. I just cooked until tender. Cooking times to me are a guideline and should be used that way.<br/><br/>Also, follow the ingredients as is.  A recipe like this really benefits from fresh ginger and the red pepper flakes. That is what sets this aside from other rice dishes.<br/><br/>Very nice dish.  I served it with a Thai chicken and loved it. Have just a bit leftover for lunch tomorrow. I sliced up the little bit of leftover chicken for a perfect light lunch.<br/>Thx for a nice recipe<br/>Kim",5

(I think she used a recipe off Oprah's website - same thing, right?)  I may make a couple of procedural changes next time I make it, as I found the meat to be a tad underseasoned (easily remedied by salting before hand).  And I think I'm going to make my own beef stock next time, as I think that will improve the flavor, as well.  I used a Merlot as the wine, left the onion slices and carrots in because I was too lazy to pick them out.  I also used already cut stew meat to save time.  Don't think I'll do that again, either, as I don't think it has as much flavor as a whole roast you cut yourself.  The mushrooms and pearl onions were sublime, and I loved the smoky undertones from the bacon.  I will be looking forward to the next time I make this, in order to follow the recipe more closely and taste the differences.",4

I didn't have any lime juice, tho--even tried to find lemon seas in my spice cupboard, but had to leave it out. I did coat the chicken in olive oil, THEN added the spices to coat better. I used more salt & cumin, less red pepper (used cayenne) & less black pepper as well--hubby's preferences. All I had was green pepper, but that worked fine.

It was good, but I don't think it is really like PF Chang's.

NOT much, but it is definitely missing something.<br/><br/>But overall, they were good. I wasn't a huge fan of them when I got them at PF Chang's but my g/f was, so I made these for her.

When I review a recipe, I usually divide it in half and make it the original post and then add my changes. So here is the review.<br/><br/>First, I really didn't like the texture of the ground beef. I asked my butcher to take a round steak and rough grind it.  It gave me a more steak like texture and that made a huge difference  for me in the overall taste.<br/><br/>Second, I didn't find too much red pepper, it was fine for me.<br/><br/>Third, I did add broccoli because it was just to one dimensional for me, it need some texture and different flavors. I did use fresh broccoli and some fine match stick sliced carrots, just for a little crunch. I think that helped.<br/><br/>Overall the flavor was good, I used a good szechuan noodle but the sauce was not bad.<br/><br/>As one poster mentioned, it reminded them of an Asian Sloppy Joe over noodles. I agree in a way. That is why I think the carrots and broccoli and the meat texture really changed the texture, but not necessarily the flavor. I purchased my ground sirloin right at the regular grocery store. I just asked the butcher to rough grind it for me, or you can do it yourself at home.  I think it really helped the overall recipe.<br/><br/>I will try it again with a few changes. 3 stars for the texture and presentation; but 4 for the overall flavor<br/>Thx, Kim",4

I used 2 (5 oz.) chicken breasts, and it wasn't too much chicken (we didn't think). I used 3 tsp. of cajun seasoning, I cooked the chicken in olive oil, and used white onion in place of the green onion. I only had 1/4 c. whipping cream, so I used 3/4 cup fat free milk and thickened the sauce with 1 Tbsp water/1 Tbsp cornstarch slurry, and that worked great! I replaced the sundried tomatoes with diced tomatoes, because I don't like sundries tomatoes - it's a texture thing I think. Maybe a taste thing too, I dunno. Haha. I also probably doubled the garlic, because I like garlic (and the husband doesn't complain!).

There are not many recipes I can try to recreate that I can say that As my sense of taste is diminished I usually have to compensate by changing a recipe. and when I rate it I have to use my changes as otherwise it is not fare to the creator as sometimes I want to give a low rating when hundreds of others loved I know it is just my taste buds speaking and not fair to the cook.

Used Mrs. dash instead of seasoning salt because it's what I had on hand.  Definitely recommend using Panko crumbs.  Also pour out Ranch a little at a time so if you don't use it all you don't have to toss it because raw chicken was in it. Easy cleanup using foil too. My son who is 5 and is pretty much a vegetarian actually finished this off before his carnivorous 3 yr old brother.  Will definitely make again!,4

The only change I made was to use chopped walnuts.  Think I might add coconut next time.

I got an idea from Dr. Kaley to mix up the flour a bit and did the half spelt/half all purpose unbleached to make it.  This was my first spelt experience and I must say that the flavor is much lighter and less, um, earthy than doing whole wheat.  Great way to get some whole grains into the diet and the guys all gobbled them up! update: I've made these several times and sometimes they don't come out as good.  I think it has a lot to do w the temperature of the wet ingredient. Warm butter, cold egg and cold milk don't mix!

Also used fat free half and half with good results! I will be making this again!",5

My first attempt at making meatballs and it turned out great! I used 1 pound of 81/19 ground beef and 1 pound of mild italian sausage. I added a bit more bread crumb and milk since I added to the meat amount overall by 1/2 pound and just did by feel of the mixture. I still only used one egg. I used some Italian bread crumbs that I make and keep on hand and just added a littl extra oregano and dried parsely. I baked for 15 minutes and simmered in the sauce for 20 minutes. They turned out AMAZING and DH has said this is his new favorite way to eat spaghetti. So much for the regular plain ground Italian sausage I normally brown for my sauce! I got 3 dozen meatballs and used 12 and froze the other 24 for later use! Thanks Kitten for another easy and oh-so-succesful recipe! Love it!,5

My husband asked if this was like an upside down pizza, and I agree it has that kind of flavor.  I will fix this again adding more spice and vegies, maybe olives and bell pepper.

I subbed about 25 oz of crushed tomatoes and 3 tbsp of verde salsa.  Also, I had no carrots, and I think they woud definitely have added some good flavor.

I only had one bunch of Kale, so I cut back to 1 tsp of salt but used full amounts of the other ingredients.  Just because of his personal preference I will cut back a little more on the salt (I personally thought it was great).  Loved the flavors and texture.  I did over bake mine a bit even on 350, that was my own fault (and my oven bakes a little hotter) and it still had great taste, I just need to be more careful next time because over baking does make the Kale a little bitter.  We will definitely be making this again with 2 bunches and have plans to add this to our garden this year if possible!  Thank you for a great, healthy recipe!  Can't wait to have this again.",5

For the sauce, I mixed together hot sauce, chili garlic sauce to make it even more spicy, and a smokey bbq sauce just for a bit of depth. I tossed the wings in the sauce and broiled them for another 10-15 minutes, and they were perfect. The wings were so good, crisp on the outside and super tender inside.

This bread is terrific!!  I really wanted to purchase a loaf of Irish Soda Bread at a local bakery (and they make great soda bread)... but I figured I would give this recipe a shot since it had so many terrific reviews.  I am so glad I did.  This bread is so easy to make especially with my Kitchen Aid mixer and it so moist.  I did adjust it slightly.  I soaked the raisins in Irish whiskey (hey --St. Patrick's Day is almost here!!) and only put in 1 Tbs of caraway seeds and used light sour cream. I'll be baking this bread for St. Patty's Day instead of buying it!!  Thanks for a great recipe!! Happy St. Patrick's Day to all!!<br/><br/>UPDATE --I made this again ---in fact I made 2 loaves. I almost bought the irish soda bread at my local bakery because I was getting lazy!  I didn't.  This bread is so easy to make!!  I added 2 T of caraway seeds in each --so glad I did.  I again soaked the raisins in Irish Whiskey --- YUM!!. When I made the second loaf I didn't have any sour cream and I didn't want to run to the store so I used 2% greek plain yogurt instead. SO SO glad I did.  My second loaf turned out even better. I don't know if this was a fluke but I will try it with greek yogurt again.  I also made homemade butter - all I can say is YUM!!!  This is one of my FAVORITE recipes.,0

I wore gloves (which I already have for cutting jalapeno peppers) when I mixed up the ingredients, and I used my cookie scoop to make uniform-sized meatballs. After they were all scooped out, I just rolled them a bit (still with the gloves on) so they were more round. From the doubled recipe, I got 72 meatballs. I used some for dinner and froze the rest. They were the perfect amount of ""Italian meatball"" spicy-ness. My husband said, ""Where do you think the saying 'That's a spicy meat-a-ball!' came from?""

I subbed red pepper flakes for the cayenne and fresh parsley instead of dried. We really liked the seasoning - it had a nice zing without being too spicy and the lime was a great finishing touch. I don't like tough shrimp so rather then worring about browning I cook it at a much lower temp to try and get it to absorb the flavors, and pull it out off the pan when it's just barely done since it will continue to cook.

And yes, there is a little red wine vinegar at the end of cooking, but also red wine in the broth.  NOW, everyone has to remember, that a lot of their ingredients are commercial, so we can't duplicate it exactly.  But this was very nice.<br/>I added a bit of tomato paste for a little richness, and as I said ... it is close, and very good which is why I gave it 5 stars.

Due to the added liquid and the fact that I cook my pasta per servings in a separate pot (due to freezing) I only added 2 cups of hot water.

For the soft tops I brushed on melted butter as they came out of the oven and they were soft but not squishy.

I covered it with ganache--it was delicious! As some other commenters have said, it is not super sweet or rich, but it makes the perfect backdrop for a rich frosting or ganache. I like that this doesn't require baking chocolate squares since I never seem to have them on hand. It would be good with espresso or cinnamon to spice it up a bit, but for a simple chocolate cake, this is a great choice! I baked in a 9x13 glass pan and it was done in 30 minutes.***Edit to add: the cupcake pictures I posted have Recipe #454493 on them and that was fantastic as well as the ganache I usually use.

It's a great way to use up leftover half jars of spaghetti sauce in your fridge! I didn't have any thawed sausage, so I used a 6 oz. can of mushrooms and a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives in place of it. I didn't saute the onion pieces, I just cut them small, as they are not sauteed on a regular pizza. I used turkey pepperoni, cut some into 4ths to stir into the casserole, and left some for the top of the casserole. I used mini wagon wheel pasta, and just kind of eyeballed the sauce (I used tomato-basil Classico) and seasoning. The baking time and temperature were right on. I only made 1/4 of the recipe, since I was just making it for a dinner for my husband and me, but it would be a great thing to have and freeze. I would probably make it this way (with more veggies) again, since we usually order supreme-type pizzas. Thanks!",4

I used 1 egg white & added 1 tbsp chopped pecans & a few mini choc chips (very yum!). I do recommend preheating your griddle well since the batter is thin & the oats do tend to clump up in the middle--so mix the batter well. After I poured the batter, I used a spoon to ""spread"" the oats out so they'd be evenly distributed. I topped the 2 pnk w/ banana slices & sugar free syrup.

Origional review follows: I made these Saturday eve for a holiday cocktail party I was hosting for my neighborhood. They were very very easy to make. So easy, I wasn't sure if they would be good but they sure were. I used Kraft sharp cheddar cheese which was a nice compliment to the other items I put out and the abundance of wine that we drank lol. This is a great recipe to have at hand for spir of the moment gatherings or to keep hunger at bay if dinner will be late. Its a good thing I tasted one before I set them out otherwise I never would have, they flew off the plate so fast. Thanks for a great recipe.",5

Took another reviewers advise and carmilized the onions (adding celery and garlic to them) prior to adding to the mix, added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke as we love that smoky flavor and 1 tablespoon of worchester sauce for flavor.  Added another 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce and then baked as directed in one of those special meatloaf pans that has 2 layers and drains off the grease.  The end result was a lovely meatloaf that was firm when cutting and tasted awesome, took your advise and made extra sauce to use for dipping on the side.  YUM!!

I am renaming the recipe 1 measuring cup cookies.  Love the fact that I did not have a sink full of measuring cups after mixing the ingredients.

Used it for making a Chicken Caesar Salad PIZZA (see menu from Pizza Amore restaurant in La Crosse, Wisconsin for a description).   I had this while on vacation in June 2011, and wanted to replicate it at home for my hub.   Make a garlicky sauce, then add grilled chicken, veggies, cheese--and bake.   After it comes out and you slice the pizza, pile on some dressed romaine (the smaller the pieces the better it transports to the mouth on the pizza slice).   EAT and ENJOY!

I won't mash the lentils next time (as this - I think- might be responsible for a graininess noticeable in parts of the loaf) but instead add them whole. Because the celery & onion added a bit of texture/crunch to the loaf which helped with texture, next time I think I might also try adding sunflower seeds and/or grated carrots to the mix.

After reading all the reviews and looking at the recipe I had to agree it needed some spices. Did everything in the directions but added a pinch of nutmeg, some garlic salt, thyme, poultry seasoning, rosemary and about 1/4 cup white wine and I added a bit of frozen peas.  For the top crust I used Pillsbury crescent rolls. The flavor was so yummy, we really enjoyed this dish so much. I had made the mixture the night before and then made the individual bowls for lunch in the morning. It took just and extra 15 minutes in the oven. But next time I make this I would like it to have just a bit more juice to it. It had creamy flavor but I would of preferred just a bit more liquid so I would add a little more broth and wine. The wine really adds a very nice rich flavor to the dish. Thanks so much for sharing your lovely recipe vincy....We loved it....<br/><br/>UPDATE: Made this again and went with adding the extra 1/4 cup of wine with an extra 3/4 cup of broth which was an extra 1 cup of liquid to the recipe in all.  Perfect...and I measured the seasonings I put in and it was a pinch of nutmeg and a tsp. of the other spices mentioned above. It made this delicious dish even more yummy, had the perfect amount of creaminess...I would also like to add that I had timed myself and it was all done and ready to pop in the oven in 30 minutes not an hour....

I used onion powder instead of onions, used one cup of half and half and one cup of evaporated milk, its what I had on hand. I didn't have linguine so used thin egg noodles.

Thanks for the recipe!<br/><br/>They remind me of Pillsbury Grands but are more tender.  This morning I used 1/3 whole wheat flour.  Then tonight I used a little more than half.  They were both great.  I think with a greater quantity of whole wheat flour, a little more yeast is needed for the best rising results.  Next time I'll try 100% whole wheat.<br/><br/>My husband would like me to try one of the cream cheese frostings instead of this simple glaze... so I'll mix it up some time.<br/><br/>And a funny thing... I got mixed up on the recipe and didn't let it rise the extra hour after cutting them (they rise one hour in the bread machine)... they were still delicious!<br/><br/>Oh yes, and like another reviewer, I also use brown sugar instead of white sugar with the cinnamon... that just seems better and I'll stick with it because the results are FABULOUS!",5

It did take a while to cut the squash (and since I'm already having problems with dry hands, I used gloves as someone suggested, which did slow me down some), but it was so easy.

Other loaf I rolled out and made a large buffalo chicken filled sandwich and baked 25 minutes, brushing with the butter the last five!  Fantastic!",5

Didn't have fresh broccoli so used frozen which had been thawed. After browning the chicken I dumped the broccoli over the top along with the sauce and a few sliced green onions and cooked for about 5 minutes, adjusted the seasonings and served over rice. (149)",5

I made a couple of slight changes....Started with 1/2 lb pepper cracked amish bacon and the 1 1/2 cups left over ham cooking in pot with a bit of olive oil.  After the bacon sweated a bit - I took the ham / bacon mixture out.  I then added all of the veggies (plus lots of extra of each) and got the brown bits off the bottom of the pan.  Added the water and followed the recipe....except used whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and used 2 C light cheese.  I ended up needing about 3/4 C more milk b/c of all of the veggies.  The soup was still quite thick and excellent.  YUM.  Thanks  UPDATE:  just made this again - added a ham hock to the broth as the potatoes cooked - and the flavor is great.  Added a couple carrots to the veg too!  Used the immersion blender to puree a bit as well.  Sooooo goood!,5

Granted, I substituted Velveeta Queso Blanco since that's what I had on hand so I don't know if the low fat version would have made much of a flavor change.

I added a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, drained.  I added 1 stalk celery, chopped and sauteed that w/onion and also added a bit more cumin, cayenne and some chili powder.  I had to omit the cheese due to a dietary issue but did add about 1/3 cup of heavy cream, some cornstarch and about a 3/4 cup of frozen corn, to thicken it to make it more like a chili than a soup.

Must be a delicious sight (and taste) since nearly everything you've listed is a winner!<br/><br/>This IS better than any canned frosting and likely worlds healthier, too. I could eat the whole batch of frosting plain!<br/><br/>A few words of wisdom...After the first cup of sugar, I was actually okay with the flavor. It was sweet enough for me. I ended up using a little over 2 cups, but I don't think it was necessary, even with the 1/2-3/4 Cups of cocoa powder that I put in it. The other thing is that I kept adding whipping cream to get a fluffier smoother consistancy, because it seemed a bit stiff to me, but in retrospect, I think I added too much. This should be a VERY FIRM frosting, like the kind you do buy canned in stores. It could be thinner if you wish, but the taste of the cream really comes through, in that case. Also, if you are working in a (very) small kitchen with a very hot oven or in a hot climate, expect a bit of melting to occur. All the more reason to have a very stiff frosting, imho. I have a batch that were made in a ""cool"" environment that turned out absolutely fine but my second batch, made near a hot oven are swimming in frosting. THere are worse things that could happen, of course. :D I just popped them in the fridge so they should be fine. <br/><br/>I made as directed and just needed to frost a couple of batches of cupcakes so I had PLENTY left over! Glad I didn't double! So I'll be freezing it, probably in some sort of small bowl container with the tupperware type lid and then just defrost in the fridge when I need some Icing post-haste. I've got enough there to cover a cake, if I don't eat it all before it gets to the freezer.<br/><br/>Thanks again. No need for any other chocolate frosting/icing recipe. <br/>THIS is the ONE!",5

BUT, I doled it out between my family and myself, so none goes in the freezer, this time.   I prepared as directed, only subbing rotini pasta instead of spaghetti.  I always forget at least one item on my grocery list and this time it was spaghetti.  So I used 12 oz of rotini and followed the instructions as directed by the recipe.  It was so good and I believe it would even be better if I had used spaghetti.  I think that 12 oz of rotini was too much for the sauce mix, so if I had reduced the amount of rotini pasta that would have definitely helped, but I really recommend not subbing if you can help it.  Loved the cheesiness of the sauce and the little bite of heat from the mild Ro-tel tomatoes.  Just creamy goodness and definitely comfort food.

I just let it simmmer, simmer and simmer...it finally thickened up. I suspect that perhaps those that tasted too much vinegar did not let it cook off enough. <br/>I prepared my 4 chicken breasts halves(boneless, skinless) in the crock pot with the glaze and then poured it off into a small pot and simmered on the stove until it thickened. While the glaze was thickening, I ""shredded"" the chicken in large pieces.<br/>I also added some quartered onion and an additional clove of garlic which I made sure some of which simmered in the pot with the glaze.<br/>Served with steamed rice, carrots & broccoli. I think some water chestnuts would add a nice crunch, but I didn't have them on hand. Thanks for sharing!<br/>***Update*** With the remaining leftovers, and since we had a snowfall today (in October!) I felt compelled to have soup.

I put a pan of broccoli with EVOO and garlic next to it in the oven and at the 30 minute mark I put my rice cooker to work. When the hour was up I put the pot back on the burner and added some corn starch mixed with a little of the sauce and let it boil until it thickened. This was a very easy meal that I'm sure I'll make again and again. It was wonderful with the jasmine rice and would be great with mashed potatoes or even egg noodles.

I added some bacon wrap and let marinate for a few hours before cooking (just because I wanted to get the prep done early and have an easy dinner).  Basted every 10 minutes while cooking for about 45 minutes, at which point it registered 170 on a meat thermometer.  So I probably could have taken it out closer to 30 minutes.  Served with the sauce and a spicy Chinese style rice.  Overall I would say it is very good and I will make it again but probably tweak it by adding some pineapple for a sweet & sour flair or maybe some mustard for a honey dijon flavor.",4

I also melted the butter and mixed it with the Ritz crackers before I put them over the top to get a good even brown.

Filter the bones and veggies out, and store the stock in containers in the fridge.  After a few hours the fat will solidify on the top and can be removed.

I bought a pre-cooked ham (without a bone) prior to finding this recipe. Looking at the cooking time I didn't think my ham would really work so I took it back. The grocery store didn't sell ""raw"" hams which is what I thought I was looking for. (I don't cook a lot of ham.) The butcher suggested a pre-cooked spiral sliced bone-in ham. It did have a longer cooking time on its directions although it was only about 2 hours (it was half a ham...not 15 pounds). I cooked it for 2-3 hours at 325 (ham directions said 300 and this recipe said 350 so I compromised). It was still cold in the middle. I bumped it back up to 350 for about another hour and that was better. The end result was fabulous. So, for anyone who really hasn't dealt much with hams... I'm guessing the pre-cooked, no bone ham would have been fine with a shorter cooking time. The spiral sliced bone-in ham was fantastic as I spread each slice with the sauce before going in the oven. Anyway, I will do this recipe again. The ham/sauce is wonderful. Thank you!",5

I made the meatballs as instructed but cut them in half when I put them on the casserole so we had more. I followed everything else as written. The spaghetti sauce that I used was a very thick and hearty sauce so it needed the extra water but I would suggest using less (or none at all) if you have a thinner sauce to avoid the bread getting soggy. I used an Italian loaf that I cubed and let sit out overnight and the next day until dinnertime and the bread on the bottom actually got pretty crispy. I also made sure that I completely covered all of the bread with the cream cheese/mayo mixture to keep the sauce from dripping down onto the bread. Everyone really enjoyed this meal and it is now in our ""Make Again"" file. The only thing that got complaints was that my husband said when he heated it the next day for lunch, the bread had soaked up the spaghetti sauce and gotten soggy and doughy.

I brined the pork first (1 1/2 qt water, 3 T salt, 1 hour) which I try to do for all pork dishes. I had economy chops and did not remove any fat; I scored the fat on the edges so the chops wouldn't curl. I used a combination of Italian flavored panko crumbs and regular panko crumbs because I was out of other bread crumbs. I also skipped the parmesan (I know, I know - it's even in the title) because what I had on hand was shredded rather than grated and I didn't want to waste it. (I would have just moved on to another recipe, but by that point I was completely out of time.) Also due to the time crunch I skipped both the flour and the egg steps and just put the wet chops in the crumbs, like you do with commercial Shake n Bake. I baked them on a wire rack over the pan and used a probe thermometer set to 150. I don't know how long they took, but it was quick and might have been close to the stated time. My family members seemed to like them, and they would probably rate my version 3* or 4*; I don't give stars when I screw a recipe up this badly. :)",0

I made the recipe as written except I had a tray of 10 thighs to use up.

I flipped them after the first hour.<br/>Once they were done, I poured the liquid into a gravy separator to let the fat float out of them. Adding some cornstarch mixed with water and cooking down the sauce made it perfect for pouring over the chicken and rice.<br/>Thanks for a great recipe.",4

We had a lot of vine ripened tomatoes to be used up.  We made the recipe exactly as stated and made one batch with extra jalapenos for a spicy batch.  Since our tomatoes were already real ripe, the sugar really didn't need to be added.  We noticed that it gave it too much of a sweet taste and hid some of the spiciness.  But after the salsa has sat in the cupboard for a couple months the sweetness finally mellowed out and the spice has shined thru!  So if you added the sugar and was afraid it made it too sweet, just give it a little while to marinate to together and mellow, it will turn out fine!  If you plan on eating it all right away, than you can decide if you want to add the sugar or not if you tomatoes are already sweet.  The ratios in this salsa are perfect for a nice mild salsa.  Thanks for this great recipe.  Im sure when we want to can salsa again we will be coming to this one!",5

I used the IQF fillets, which usually end up really watery even when fully thawed. I also only had one pound, but it was 6 fillets! They were really thin. I should have spaced them out into a larger pan (my mistake). After the first cooking (10 min.), I used a turkey baster to remove some excess liquid. Then I added the topping and baked an additional 5 min. They didn't really brown but they were cooked perfectly (but runny again). I enjoyed the flavor, but my fish-hating son wasn't fooled. Even so, I will probably make this again. I have a few strategies up my sleeve now if I have to use the frozen fillets again, but I would love to try fresh.",4

I also used the entire package of onion soup, both times, but only because I didn't feel like having the open packet laying around. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe totally, except subbing Coke for Pepsi. I am a die-hard Coke fan, and would never have Pepsi in my house ;) It turned out great. So very tender and moist. Pork roast can sometimes be dry, and this was not at all. The second time I made this, I subbed the mushroom soup for a golden mushroom soup, and also the onion soup for a beefy onion soup packet. The second time had a rich gravy, slightly different. I think I did prefer the original version myself. There was so much nice gravy both times. I noticed it took a little more cornstarch to make it thicken, and I assume it's from the soda. Not a big deal at all, because this is worth it. The first time, we had mashed potatoes with the roast and gravy. I used the leftovers from the first batch to make a different spin on a traditional Sheppard's pie. Fantastic! The second time, I used the leftovers with wide egg noodles. All the kids liked it. Even my DD who is anti-pork. We just told her it was a regular roast beef pot roast ;) Cheers!",5

I did use half low-fat cream cheese, low fat Cool Whip and low fat sour cream...and non of the fat was missed. Also, to make ahead, I cut up and sweetened the strawberries the day before and since they released water overnight, poured that off. I made the cream cheese mixture but did not add the cake until a few hours before serving. Very tasty!",5

I halved this recipe for just my husband and me but tripled the sauce (added cornstarch) which was delicious on its own but next time I'll try the capers. The dijon mustard added outstanding flavor to the breading mix and did a great job of helping the crumbs to adhere. For those of us looking to jazz up boring chicken breasts without using a ton of butter or oil this recipe is a lifesaver. I'm adding this recipe to my permanent collection--thanks so much for posting! :),5

But I want to keep track of the recipe, so here I am. =) I like how versatile this recipe is... made it the other night with 1/2 Vermont Sharp and 1/2 Extra Sharp (yum!) for our DD who had wisdom teeth out (owww). And last night for us... and since we can't take all that fat, I used 0% milk, and 1/2 lowfat sharp and 1/2 part skim mozzarella. Not as decadent, but certainly a wiser choice for the over 40 crowd. Since Easter just passed, we'll be having some with chopped ham for lunch! Thanks, Bev.

I served it with grilled turkey, tomato and cheese sandwiches and it was a wonderful winter dinner. <br/><br/>4/11/12 I made it again. Added more cumin, some chili powder, cayenne and it was met with even better reviews. Served it with a vegetable quesadilla and strawberry shortcake for dessert and my boys are fat and happy, but dined on healthy so it was a definite win. DH has already requested this soup in his lunchbox and how can I deny...it came from a couple cans. Delicious. My son and a friend came in this evening and DS told the friend that he needed some of what we had for dinner, it was really good. Love it",4
