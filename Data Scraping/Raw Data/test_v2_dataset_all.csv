The flavor of the peanut butter and chocolate are fabulous!  There are a couple little things I would suggest though...you need to edit to include add the milk with the peanut butter as that is missed in the directions but I figured that is when it is added.  When I made the first one and immediately turned it out onto the plate, the custard bowl was extremely hot, the cake did not want to drop and when I did get it out I was missing a good chunk of the cake.  So (I know this is really trying here...) I made it a 2nd time (such a sacrifice lol) and let it cool in the microwave a minute, then another minute on the counter.  The cake still had a bit of a hold on the bottom of the custard cup but eventually dropped without loosing but a skim of the cake so maybe another minute of cooling would help.  Either way - just serve the cake in the custard cup and you have a nifty and quick dessert for one that is moist yet has a firm texture so it is not all crumbly and the cake flavor itself is just delightful.

Now I did use all the ingredients that the  recipe called for but a few other things were tossed in.I added some seasoned salt,pepper,and garlic powder to the beef as it was browning.Except for not adding the carrots(at this time),tomato soup, and tomato sauce all the other ingredients were added.Instead of cooking on high for 4 to 5 hours, I let the stew cook on low for 7 hours,then added the carrots(which were pre-cooked & partially frozen )tomato soup,and sauce.I tasted the broth and felt like it need something, so more Italian Seasonings were added along with some crushed red pepper flakes.After the final hour, the potatoes were cooked to perfection,but the carrots were still too much on the firm side. I think that if I make this again, I'm going to add the carrots when the recipes states and make sure they are cut into smaller pieces.Other than that the carrots being too firm, the stew had a pretty good flavor.

I also used the entire package of onion soup, both times, but only because I didn't feel like having the open packet laying around. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe totally, except subbing Coke for Pepsi. I am a die-hard Coke fan, and would never have Pepsi in my house ;) It turned out great. So very tender and moist. Pork roast can sometimes be dry, and this was not at all. The second time I made this, I subbed the mushroom soup for a golden mushroom soup, and also the onion soup for a beefy onion soup packet. The second time had a rich gravy, slightly different. I think I did prefer the original version myself. There was so much nice gravy both times. I noticed it took a little more cornstarch to make it thicken, and I assume it's from the soda. Not a big deal at all, because this is worth it. The first time, we had mashed potatoes with the roast and gravy. I used the leftovers from the first batch to make a different spin on a traditional Sheppard's pie. Fantastic! The second time, I used the leftovers with wide egg noodles. All the kids liked it. Even my DD who is anti-pork. We just told her it was a regular roast beef pot roast ;) Cheers!",5

The gravy was fantastic. I don't think I spent enough time browning the pork, because the coating tasted a little pastey, like uncooked flour. I used really big pork steaks, which I had to brown one at a time. So of course, my pan was no where near big enough to finish on the stove top. I put the pork into a big lasagna pan and covered it with the gravy. I covered the pan with tin foil and baked at 350?F for about 30 or so minutes. The pork came out really super tender and moist. The gravy was great. We served this with thick mashed potatoes and fresh whole green beans. All together a great comfort food meal. Next time, I'll spend a little more time on the browning process.

I placed 2 T. of flour into the broth before adding it to the sauce, but other than that followed the sauce recipe to the tee.  As the poster suggested, it was very lemony and I added another 1/4 cup of broth to tone it down.  I think the saltiness of the proscuitto I added helped take the edge off the lemon too.",5

So, I decided to add some cooked brown rice and some corn to the soup and then I thickened it by adding a half can of tomato paste.  I did use all of the ""add in"" options you indicated as well - red wine and red wine vinegar and the worcestershire and I think these changes did add to the original recipe.

I used really good vanilla (my homemade isn't ready for another couple of months) and am glad I did because with one Tablespoon of it, vanilla is a dominant flavor in this recipe.  I used a 2-teaspoon sized cookie scoop (Oxo brand/size small) to measure the dough and we ended up with 60 cookies.  My ovens cook a little hot, and that combined with smaller cookies than the recipe suggests, convinced me to reduce the bake time after the first batch got a tad crispy at 15 minutes.

I wanted to address the issue of cooking time, after reading so many reviews that insisted the stated time was wrong, or would ruin the chops. I did cook these less than the stated time, but only because it was late and I was starving. I did brine my chops (I almost always do - 3 T salt in 1 1/2 qt. water for almost an hour), but I am not sure how effective it was this time... my son did it for me and I discovered that the salt didn't all dissolve. I followed the recipe exactly to the point of putting it in the oven. I cooked the dish for 30 min. At that point, the meat temp was 184F, or ""overcooked"". Usually you would cook pork to 145F and let rest to about 155F. They were not dry and tasted good. That said, there was plenty of liquid and moisture in the covered pan for a proper oven braise, and 1 1/2 hours would have been perfect for that. The texture would be completely different, but tasty. I would like to try that if I made this again (but will likely not given that half my family didn't like it). I used Empire apples, which had a good flavor and moisture content.

I used two cans of cream of onion instead of the mushroom and celery.  Because I was removing the celery and mushroom flavors I added about a 1/2 teaspoon each of oregano, basil and thyme.  I used your recipe #443432 for the mashed potato topping.  I was only cooking for a couple toddlers and myself, so I chose to make one deep dish pie to freeze for a family dinner sometime, and divided the rest between four 6-oz ramekins for today's lunch.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was!  It is a very easy recipe to whip up and it tastes fabulous.  After the 30 minute bake time (which was the same for both pie and ramekins), I turned on the broiler and gave them 2-5 minutes to brown the tops before removing from the oven.  The two ramekins that broiled for 5 minutes began to burn, and even though that didn't look as pleasing, they didn't taste burnt.

I did not feel that it was too sweet at all.  In fact, the balance of sweet and tangy was really nice.  Because I actually made this recipe before rating  it, I can help others in the future by letting them know that the longer the salad sits in the fridge, the more the dressing liquifies.  I poured small amounts at a time, stirring between each one and eventually ended up pouring it all in because the mixture just looked so dry.  I refrigerated it and left the house for 2 hours.  When I returned, the dressing had liquified and the salad was akin to the liquid/solid ratio of KFC cole slaw.  It tastes great and I wouldn't change a thing, except next time if I'm not serving it within 30 minutes I'll try using around 2/3 of the dressing.  I don't consider this a problem in any way, because some people like their cole slaw with lots of dressing.  This recipe allows you to customize it to your tastes.

My breads were still pretty liquid in the center at 35 minutes, so I kept them in for an extra 10 minutes or so. In hindsight, I probably should've divided the bottom and top batter a little more evenly, but only for appearance (the middle toffee layer and the top toffee layer blended into one on one of my breads, which wasn't as pretty as the other with distinct layers when sliced).

My husband called it ""homemade Wonder Bread.""  The texture of the crumb is nice, but the crust is far too soft.  It needs more eggs.<br/><br/>It's a very time-consuming recipe.  FOUR rises?  I can't even imagine the work this would be if it were made by hand.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the way the recipe is written.  I assume that everyone who considers making it will read the instructions through first, and realize that you don't add ALL the ingredients to the bread machine, as the first direction states.  It would be a nuisance trying to extract the egg white, the seeds and the raisins.  But adding the ingredients in the order listed is not correct for any bread machine.  Some call for adding the liquid ingredients, and then the dry ones; for others, it's the other way around.  None are mixed up like this.  It's not that important, unless you're using a delay cycle, but it's a frustrating direction.<br/>The ingredient list mentions poppy seeds; the directions mention sesame seeds.  This brings up the question:  Are you supposed to put poppy seeds into the bread, and then top it with sesame seeds, or are they both for topping, and you make your choice?<br/><br/>325? is far too cool an oven for bread.  I baked mine at 375? for the required time, and it was still underdone (in an accurate oven).  <br/><br/>It's not awful.  It's a very sweet, light bread.  It makes good toast.

I really liked how the butter lightly crisps the edges of the fish (I don't keep margarine on hand, so I had to use all butter). Nice seasoning combination too. I had to omit the fines herbes because I didn't have any on hand, and I didn't have time to look up the components of it to make my own, but there were plenty of other seasonings in the mix to make up for it. I probably wouldn't do this all the time because it does have kind of a lot of butter in the recipe, but I have to admit that I couldn't bring myself to pour all the yummy seasoned butter off before serving. Instead, I spooned a bit of the butter sauce over the individual servings of fish. I served this with some seasoned cooked carrot sticks and Mexican rice.

I did not use the rice as I am on a pretty strict low-carb diet and ""those"" types of carbs are just too much for my system. I used broccoli slaw mix rather than coleslaw mix - just a personal preference. No granny smith apples so I used honeycrisp. I didn't have the OJ concentrate so I just used fresh OJ. I had my doubts about the ""sauce"" when I first tasted it - the mayo flavor was very strong and the orange flavor was very faint! For sure, this definitely needs some ""marrying time"" in the refrigerator - I chilled about 1.5 hours. The end result was a refreshing and light tasting ""dreamsicle"" flavored slaw - DELICIOUS. The pecans added quite a bit to the flavor and texture. I will definitely make this again and I hope you don't mind the modifications I chose. Thanks so much for posting - I absolutely love this!

In the end I had added so much powdered sugar that it was very sweet and you didn't taste the orange very much.  Once again, it was still good, just not great.

My batch didn't come out so cute because I pressed the crust into the pan too firmly -- I had to chisel the crust out of the pan, but that was my own fault (I always over-press pressed crusts). I was a little nervous about how thin the filling was before baking, but it firmed up just fine in the end.

I had to sub regular Godiva liqueur for the white chocolate version because that's what I had. I also left out the nut topping -- I had some chopped pecans set aside for this, but I forgot to put them in the pan first and didn't think it made sense to add them to what would be the bottom of the cake. I think the glaze would've been a bit more attractive with the white chocolate liqueur, but that was my own fault for not having the right liqueur. The flavor was lovely, though. Thanks for posting!

I ended up adding 2 Tbsp to the pan drippings and made a roux, then continued on with the recipe.  The other reviews don't mention too much flour so I'm not sure what happened there.  The flavour was good but the meat turned out a bit on the dry side.  I may try this again and perhaps reduce the browning time. I am glad I tried the recipe, thanks for posting.",4

DH didn't care for it (but he doesn't like casseroles).  I do think the meat to cornbread ratio could stand to be a bit higher.  I halfed the recipe (since there's just the two of us and I figured I'd be the one eating it).  If I made it again, would use twice the ground beef.  I did add some taco seasoning into the ground beef along with some onion and garlic.  I also added some salsa over the meat when layering.  I think this helped give a little more flavor and wetness too.  Oh, also added an extra layer of regular cheddar cheese b/c more cheese is always good (but I don't really care for Velveeta).

I used a sil-pat sheet and did stir it at around 15 minutes, before pressing it flat. I was hoping for some crunchiness.

Luckily, she dropped one while coloring and it cracked, so we were able to peel and eat it earlier than tomorrow.   I didn't try to peel the egg right after cooking though.  The ice water bath cooled them, my daughter colored them and then we refrigerated them for several hours.  We easily peeled the tester egg after refrigeration, and I was particularly impressed with the lightness of the egg white.  It's not as rubbery as the boiling technique and the yolks were nicely centered.  Next time I'll reduce the timing a little bit, to avoid overcooking.  Although it wasn't as bad as when they're boiled, I still found the outer rim of the yolk slightly grayed.  Also, I noticed tiny burnt spots on the shells that line up exactly where the eggs sat between the grates on the oven rack.  These are really no big deal at all, just observations.  I definitely prefer this method to boiling, and inevitably overcooking my eggs. Thanks for posting this recipe, basia1, I'll be using it again and again!",5

I made the gluten-free pasta using 250 grams of Orgran brand blended gluten-free flour and 50 grams of sorghum flour. I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum. I think next time would add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pasta as this would make it a little easier to roll. Kept the salt to the two teaspoons and thought that was the right amount for taste. I rolled my pasta out a little unevenly....but found the thinner pasta cooked up much better. Keep the thickness of the pasta no more than 2 mm and dusted them once cut with a small amount of flour to keep them from sticking. Other than my pasta being a bit thick....so it took longer to cook......we all enjoyed the dish. I think this pasta was a good gf pasta as it was easy to make and fairly easy to roll and held together when boiling. The pasta definitely has potential for something like a cheese or meat filled ravioli. Photo to be posted. Made for PAC April 2012.,4

I did the milk method which I don't useually use, as I useually use evaportated milk method. I think I will stick to the evaporated milk method.

I used mostly flap meat in this, but I tossed in about 3/4 lb skirt steak as well (trying to use up leftover meat). Carne asada is a Saturday night staple at my house, per DH's request, so he was pleasantly surprised when I offered him this marinated version instead of simple skirt steak with salt and lime. I served this with fresh guacamole, refried pintos, hot salsa, pickled jalapenos and corn tortillas.

Not paying enough attention (as usual, lol), I grabbed a bag of what I thought were frozen blueberries and measured them out for the recipe. I had just enough for this, so I tossed them in the pan and started making the preserves. Once they started to thaw and cook, I realized that I was using small Concord grapes rather than large blueberries, DUH! I'm usually pretty good about labeling my frozen bagged foods, but not that time. Anyway, I'm here to tell you that your recipe makes some pretty good grape preserves, too. Just personal preference, I'll probably reduce the spices a bit the next time I try this (with cherries, hopefully), but even with the amounts as listed in the recipe, the end product tasted very good.

To achieve a decorator consistency I added a lot of extra powdered sugar.

I know this recipe has serious potential and I will most definitely play around with it until I can use it for decorating.  The color changes from a bright burgundy to a dark mauve and eventually (with more sugar) a pale mauve with bright red specks of cranberry.  It would be a really lovely color on a wedding cake.  Even though we can't eat this frosting, it didn't go to waste.

First - I had a bag of Bob's Red Mill GF brownie mix I have been wanting to use up - so  the bag went into the mixing bowl (all 21 ounces). Next, the can of pumpkin. Third, since I read through the reviews prior to my experiment, I was a bit concerned that the brownies would not rise, so I added 1 large brown egg. Lastly 6 ounces of white choco-chips. I did mix this all together quite well, and ended up adding between 1/4 - 1/2 cup warm water so the beaters could actually get through this stuff! I then put about 1 to 1  1/2 tablespoons in each of my mini muffin pan cups and baked for 16 minutes in my 350 convection oven.

I had to improvise a bit for the sauce portion, since I didn't realize before I started making these that I had no canned tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes. I did have a couple jars of fresh-canned tomatoes from the landlord's garden, so I used those instead. After the sauce cooked for a bit, I just pureed the sauce with my stick blender and stirred in a bit of tomato paste.

Maybe it's my homemade frozen dessert inexperience speaking, but I found that this melts really quickly, although that's easily remedied by just eating it faster, lol. The sugar syrup makes this really sweet, so this might be a bit cloying with an already-sweet juice, but I bet this would be a perfect vehicle for some more tart fruit flavors (lime, grapefruit, cranberry, etc).

I used a Costco rotisserie chicken and smoked pimenton in place of the regular paprika. Like Starrynews, I gave up on the broth when I couldn't find a happy medium between not moist enough to prevent cracking, and dissolved tortilla. I heated the tortillas on my comal, which worked perfectly. I really liked the flavor of the filling in this. I served these topped with chopped iceberg lettuce, homemade guacamole, sour cream and queso fresco, and served some salsa on the side. I especially enjoyed how easy these are with rotisserie chicken and no deep frying, so much so that I don't think I'll ever bother frying taquitos again. Definitely a keeper, thanks for posting!

First, I used the largest crockpot I had - the giant one and not all the ingredients would fit and that was after I put less of a couple items in. I do think there is a mistake in the amount of meatballs, no way would you use 96 ounces of meatballs, one package of 32 ounces was almost too many meatballs. Second, without any spices this could have been a very bland recipe, I added some garlic, some Italian spice and some bay leaf and basil and it still needed more spice. I am thinking next time adding a few chili peppers. This makes a huge amount of soup way beyond 10 servings. We have enough soup for several meals, I had to remove some of the liquid from the crockpot to add the noodles.I did substitute turkey meatballs as I don't eat red meat and that substitution worked fine. This does have a lot of potential.",4

I had put some white chocolate chips in my double boiler to melt while I was making the sugar/butter mixture. Once the sugar/butter mixture had reached temperature, the chocolate hadn't fully melted yet. I added the sugar/butter to the cereal, mixed it in, checked the white chocolate and found that the chips had turned into more of a dough than a liquid (maybe I seized the chocolate?). I discarded the ""dough"" and moved on to melting some flaked white chocolate from a bar of Callebaut that I had around. The Callebaut melted much better, but by the time it was ready, the cereal mixture had hardened up quite a bit. For better coverage with the white chocolate, I transferred the cereal to a large baking sheet and broke up some of the bigger chunks of cereal before drizzling the white chocolate and adding the sprinkles. By the time I finished mixing everything, it was looking pretty scraggly, but the flavor was lovely. Oh, and I used half vanilla extract and half lemon extract for the flavoring, which made it taste vaguely like Froot Loops. I'd like to try this again using KAF's princess cake flavoring -- maybe it would make this taste more like birthday cake. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2012",4

I used 2 tsps white flour and stirred it in the bacon vegie mixture. It worked beautifully.

The name sounds more Thai or made-up to me, but I'm not going to worry about that. I did think that having both onion and green onion in the dish was a bit of overkill. The recipe calls for ""stirfry sauce"", which is something I have never used. Since the ingredients also include garlic, chicken stock and cornstarch, I decided to add a few more ingredients for flavor in lieu of the stirfry sauce. I added soy sauce, oyster sauce, a little sugar, Chinese wine and a small amount of sesame oil. I thought it worked pretty well, and though it could be improved on, provided me with a pleasant dinner.",4

The flavour was dead on with that, at least for us. I cut the pork into strips for a stir fry kind of dish. The bok choy wiltered down A LOT so don't be concerned if a bunch seems like a lot. The dish was not sticky and of course this has something to do with the reduced honey, but also the bok choy gives off a lot of liquid. Instead of stickiness we had some sauce that was on the thin side. But the flavour was great. An idea could be to cook the bok choy on the side and add when serving, I think the pork would be more sticky then",5

I cook my wheatberries in the rice cooker, as I don't have to watch the pot, and can let them sit there until they are nice and soft. I drained them, then stirred in the cherries - this helps them soften and hydrate a bit. I also made a vinaigrette and poured that over right away, as I like it to be absorbed a bit. I then let it cook before adding the celery, scallions, walnuts, etc., as you want those to stay crisp. I think it would be great with some chopped fresh herbs, a bit more celery.

I made as written except for using 1 1/4 of chicken breasts,  reducing the hot sauce to about half which was just the right spicy for us and cooking the chicken with some dried onion, garlic powder and S & P. When first tasting the sauce my instant reaction  was Dark & Very Sharp. There was no complexity to the flavor at all but a weird contrast of bland and sharpness. I added two cloves of garlic, a scant tsp of grated ginger,  a splash more soy sauce, sesame oil and peanut butter, couple tsp of brown sugar,  & about 1/4 cup of coconut cream. Some of these additions were an attempt to tone down the vinegar others to improve the flavor. In the end the sauce was still a bit on the acidic side but serving it on jasmine rice  with the cucumbers provided the balance needed. In the end we really enjoyed this dish which I served with pan grilled zuchinni slices with garlic. Made for PAC Spring 2012",3

The doughnuts rose well both before and during frying, and are acceptably light. I filled them with grape jelly, and didn't have much trouble doing so. I just made a hole in the side with a pointed chopstick and piped in the jelly. The doughnuts did not hold their shapes very well, and I am wondering if the dough should be even stiffer.

Because I changed much of the recipe do not feel it's fair to rate it with stars.   I used your formula plus blue cheese and toasted walnuts, however I used my method, which is cold fermentation.   I used instant yeast and mixed it in with the flour and salt then added cold water and kneaded for one minute in my Kitchen Aid, then allowed the dough to rest for 10 minutes.   Then kneaded another minute or so and then turned it out on an oil board.   I then stretched the dough and folded like a letter, turned it a quarter turn and then stretched and folded again.   Return the dough to the bowl, covered and allowed to rest 10 minutes and then repeated the stretch and fold process and allowed to rest 10 more minutes again with one final stretch and fold.   Placed the dough in the covered bread bucket and placed in the refrigerator for 18 hours.    Removed from the refridgerator 4 hours before I planned to bake.  After 2 hours, flattened the dough into a circle and sprinkled the walnuts and blue cheese on the top, then folded towards the center and kneaded to distribute the cheese and nuts.   Shaped the loaf and allowed to rise and then baked.   My big issue was the bread was too salty to eat, which may have been because of the cheese!",0

I cooked the potatoes on the stove, drained them, returned them to the stove top and threw in the milk and sour cream instead of yogurt to warm them up - I find they incorporate better when they are warmed.

The salad provides necessary respite from the intense flavor, although baked potato wedges are an option.  Two of these might be 1 serving for a lumberjack, but one would be enough for most people.  I had never boiled eggs this way before.  One egg peeled itself during the last 2 minutes of boiling, and the shells practically fell off the rest during the draining and cooling. However, the yolks did appear to be centered once we cut into the final product. The bacon made it easier to remove the eggs from the muffin tin.  Next time, I would put some raw diced potato at the bottom of each tin to raise the Scotch egg from the tin bottom and soak up the grease, so the bottom could brown as well. (Scrape off the potato before serving.)  (Note: 220 C is 425 F.) I would serve these for lunch or supper, or take on a picnic.

I used Quorn naked cutlets for the vegetarians and boneless skinless chicken breasts for the meat eaters.  I also used a light mayo.  But other than that followed the recipe.  It was enjoyed by everyone, which is rare in our house.  The chicken took longer than 45 minutes to cook but the breasts were on the larger side.  The Quorn only took 20-25 minutes and I did not defrost the cutlets before baking.  The only thing I may do differently is reduce the amount of seasoned salt next time.  It was just a little on the strong side.  I will be adding this to my cook book for sure. Thanks!!",5

There was no direction for serving, so I drained off all liquid and discarded the huge amount of fresh dill.  In other sources, there is an option of adding some flour to make a sauce.

I chose to make it because I liked the ingredients. I should, perhaps have looked more carefully at the amounts. 1 pound of chicken for 6 people? 1/2 cup tomato juice to simmer said chicken in for 1 hour? It doesn't really make sense to me. So, because I did want dinner, I changed things around quite a lot. I used a little over 1 pound of chicken (2 bone-in thighs), 2 medium onions and about 1 cup mushrooms that I needed to use up. I browned the chicken at first, then removed it from the pan and cooked the onions and mushrooms. 2 tablespoons of paprika seemed a bit much, even though I do like it. I used 2 teaspoons in the beginning and didn't add more after tasting. I used the stated amount of tomato juice and then added 2 cups chicken stock, because I don't like burnt food. I used yogurt cheese instead of sour cream, doubling the amount, while leaving the amount of flour as is. So, you see, my dinner tonight is not much like the recipe's dish. However, for the combination of ingredients, I think I'll go with 3 stars. Thank you for giving me a chance to use my cooking skills.",3

I made the double batch by hand, and needed 2 tablespoons more flour. Of course, a bread machine with a non-stick bucket probably wouldn't require more flour. Anyway, each to his/her own.

The sauce only needed 1 Tablespoon of water (my nut butter wasn't very thick), and had a great tanginess along with just a hint of spiciness. I did need to add quite a bit of salt, to combat the natural blandness of both the soba and the edamame. This will definitely become a lunchbox staple!",4

To prevent the onions and garlic sticking, I sprayed my Dutch oven with Pam and cooked them at a lower heat and had no problems with burning.  Next time, I would probably use fresh basil for a fresher taste. I used your recipe for meatballs and just plopped them in the Dutch oven, let them cook for  about 10 minutes, then stirred them around...then simmering them for 3 hours.

I made three changes- first, I cut the oil by half to lower the calories a bit; and second, I cut the pepper flakes in half.  We found this to be perfectly spicy, with the smaller amount of pepper, so I'd definitely do that again.  The last change was an addition- we thought the sauce was missing just a bit of acidic brightness, so I added a splash of sherry vinegar at the very last minute.  That did the trick, and we loved it!  Thanks so much for posting!",4

I kept thinking, ""Am I going to win first prize for gullibility?"" But, actually, it does work!

The picture shows what was in the freezer overnight. It could easily be scooped. I didn't mix this up in my ice cream maker. There may well be a large variety of ice cream makers, but mine is not the right type to mix things in. So, I mixed everything very well outside first, and then put it into the ice cream maker. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I used whole milk. I think perhaps a little lemon zest might be nice next time. And maybe, for me, a little less sugar, but it is fine as it is. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us. Oh, one more thing - I was afraid my lemons weren't very juicy, so I looked up how much juice there was in the average lemon - 3 to 4 tablespoons.

A look at the recipe should convince anyone that they are, and I have made them and I'm sure. I followed the recipe for the dough faithfully, but did not measure the ingredients (I used all of them) when I made the filling. I haven't made the frosting yet. Gilding the lily seems a bit much, but I may try. Because I have a small oven and wanted smaller rolls, I divided the dough into three parts and baked each part in a 9-inch round cake pan. I also lined the pans with cooking paper. I have a feeling I'm going to be very popular as long as these last. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us. BTW, 1/2 cup instant pudding came to about half of 5.1 oz box of instant pudding that I had. I suppose one box could be used for a double batch.",5

I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups of Bob's Red Mill GF flour, 1/2 cup of sorghum and 1/4 cup potato starch, just what I had on hand - worked out really well. The dough was easy to work with and the finished crackers taste great.  I would take more care next time to roll the dough more evenly.

It wasn't a lot of trouble, but it is a lot of dough. I had to halve the double batch to knead it. Oh, and this does go through the horrible sticky mess stage before you get all the flour kneaded in and achieve bread dough. Even the kneaded dough was a bit sticky, but I didn't want to get it too stiff. On the other hand, the rolls rose amazingly in the oven and are light and delicious.

Instead of the chard, I used the musroom duxelles from my recipe #457210 (that I had previously frozen)...and used gruyere cheese as fontina was not available.  Once the mushrooms had thawed out, I used some of the mushroom liquid and mixed it in with some homemade chicken broth for more of an earthier taste!   I made this dish up ahead of time and took it over to my girlfriend's place and finished off the cooking there.  Do watch what you are paring this dish with as it is really rich in taste...a little serving does go a long way.  We had this served with pork tenderloin, baby potatoes and garden salad!  As for the taste, it was absolutely nummy goodness.  Keep in mind, 4 cups of liquid would equal the amount you would need for a onion soup.  I used 3 cups and could possible have used a bit less.

There was no way I was going to get 2 tsp pork/shrimp mixture in that wrapper.  That took me about 4 wrapper duds to figure that one out!!  I could only find square wrappers, so that made them all that more fragile!  Second, I had partial froze the wrappers, but was in a rush so ended up putting them all together in a Tupperware and when I went to use them, they were one solid block.  I did a trial run with DH and took out about 12 wrappers.  They were thawed out before they went into the skillet, but even with the oil in the skillet and the broth afterwards, they ended up sticking so badly, the finished product was not very appealing! With my style of cooking,  I probably wouldn't use them as an appitizer, as I don't like doing last minute cooking before my guests and having to worry about the extra clean up!!!  Now with all that negative comments being said, here is the postive.  They tasted really great!  I decided to use the leftovers in a won ton soup!  I seasoned the chicen broth with sesame oil and soy sauce, brought the broth to a boil and added the frozen wrappers and cooked them for 2 minutes or until they all floated to the surface.  As I have 50  wrappers leftover, next time, I will add tofu, some chopped green onions and maybe some bean sprouts!  If I was to make the wrappers all over again, I would freeze them individually and place them flat with a layer of parchment or waxed paper in between.  I would definately consider omitting the cabbage, as it was more of a pain to get it in the wrappers and it was hardly noticed in the taste!  You have to have enough time to play around with these....I figured they took me 2-1/2 hours to complete them.  They were something interesting to do, and I might do them again if I am doing a Chinese theme type of dinner",0

I really was surprised there was such a difference in flavor by using only brown sugar but it was there and everyone in the family enjoyed this cake.  One little thing about the baking - using a glass pan as I did might not mean a reduction in temperature to 325F.  I found that I had to bake it 65 minutes to get the center finished but by that time the outside was browned more than I like.  I think next time (probably next weekend!) I'll use the 350F temp and bake 50-55 minutes.   The texture is wonderful in the center with a moist consistency and is perfect with fresh strawberries in their own syrup over the top.

Even so, the spinach appeared to fill the 2-3"" tall frying pan, so I would use my tall-sided Le Creuset pot if I were making more spinach (and that pot would probably accept 1 1/2 pounds of scallops at one time).  I used Tony Chacere's Creole seasoning, and I liked its subtle presence in this dish.  The only improvement I might suggest would be to chill the dredged scallops for 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to searing.  As always, the secret to searing is to make sure the pan and the fat are hot enough to sear, and it is important not to turn the scallops until they are ready; some say that if the ""meat"" sticks, and does not release, you need to wait until it does.  The spinach was not so pretty on the plate, so I would be tempted to steam it separately; DH wouldn't change a thing.  At the end, I had leftover bacon bits even though I sprinkled them liberally.  Served with a sourdough roll.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game.",5

I'd be happy to serve this as a starter for a summer dinner party, or for a light lunch.  I had to make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand, but I don't think they changed the recipe much.  First- I had frozen cooked shrimp on hand, so instead of sauteing, I omitted the olive oil and added the very finely minced garlic into the dressing.  Second, I used shallot instead of onion, which worked perfectly since I cut the recipe down to serve one.  Third- I didn't have jalapeno, so I added a dash of chili flake to the dressing for a mild kick.  As other reviewers said, I just loved the dressing.  Dill is one of my favorite fresh herbs, and it goes beautifully with the bright, fresh taste of shrimp.  I'd add more capers next time, but that's just because I adore capers- for most people, the amount called for will be perfect.  Thanks for a nice summer treat!",4

First, the turkey legs around here are big - at least 1.5 lbs. each. Two of them were all I could really fit into a Dutch oven. I used the entire amount of the remaining ingredients, but the liquid in the pan was so low that I did not feel it would cook properly, so I added a fair amount of broth. That most likely is the reason that the curry taste was so mild - really too mild. I love lamb curry, and I think overall that this can work as an excellent substitute. What I am going to look for is turkey thighs, which would have the same meaty quality as drumsticks, but none of the pesky tendons, and then fiddle with the ingredients. UPDATE: I finally found turkey thighs. My two thighs weighed 2.8 lbs. I used all of the rest of the ingredients, and I think I would increase the amount of curry next time. This was quite tasty, perhaps not quite like lamb curry, but tasty in its own right. The thighs were a lot easier to deal with than were the drumsticks. Oh, I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, as it's not tomato season just now. CROCKPOT UPDATE: I had one thigh weighing 2.3lbs. I used three garlic cloves, 3 tbl curry and all the other ingredients (except flour) as indicated. I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the curry and ginger to bring out their fragrance and flavor.  This cooked in 4 hours on low in my 5 qt crockpot - did not quite fill half and I anticipated a quick finish. I removed the turkey, then whirred all of the sauce with my immersion blender, which made a lovely sauce. Definitely my best preparation of this dish.",4

I was looking for a recipe that included whole wheat and you've hit the mark with this gem.  The waffles had a great texture to them and packed full of flavor.  I think the next time I may exclude the nuts and add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg for a little twist.  I doubled the recipe so I could have some frozen for future breakfasts.  Thanks for sharing!,5

I couldn't find any baby beets, only mutant sized ones,so I only bought one, which I cut into smaller cubes. I was surprised how the flavors of the anise and OJ  enhanced the sweetness of the beets and didn't over power their flavor. I scaled this down for one, as DH does not eat beets. In addition I omitted the pomegranate molasses, only because I could not find it any where plus I garnished it with mint from my garden. Made for NA*ME tag.",5

I marinated the lamb for 48 hours, and it turned out wonderfully flavorful and tender.  The garlic and cumin perfectly compliment the natural flovor of the meat, and the smokey, charred bits from the grill made it even better.  I used chili flakes instead of the aleppo pepper, since I didn't have it on hand.  The yogurt sauce is a great accompaniment to the meat and veggies.  I used greek yogurt, so it was very thick- more a spread than a sauce, but regular yogurt would be very good as well. This is just like a dish that I get at my favorite middle eastern restaraunt, I'm really happy that I can now make it myself!  Thanks for sharing",5

I made this pretty much as written. Cut back on the baking powder by about 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Used a nice tangy Greek yogurt and a sharp cheddar. Completely forgot about the poppy seeds. Oops! That won't happen next time. I'll make this often.

I chopped the vegetables in my food processor, which resulted in a sort of homogeneous texture, which I'm not sure I like as much as if I had used a knife. I did also cut back rather drastically on the spices, especially the curry powder, which I think was a good idea for me. Since the curry powder already contains turmeric, I think I will omit that completely next time. I also may add some ginger. I used a mixture of chicken and pork. I do think that if I had used lamb, I would have wanted somewhat stronger spicing. I have had my eye on this recipe quite a while, so am glad I finally got to it.

However, my family's taste leans a little more toward the spicy side, and in the future I'll try adding a diced jalapeno, some chili powder, or even just a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I  made this recipe as directed until serving time when I realized I had forgotten to bring home my cheddar cheese after cooking at a friend's house.

I was able to get some ripe Mexican apple mangoes, and this was the perfect recipe for them.

For each egg white, I used 2 teaspoons egg white powder and 2 tablespoons warm water, then whipped as usual. It didn't look like the powder would dissolve at first, but it did while I was whipping it. Then, because I'm lazy, I put the mixture into my ice cream freezer and froze it there. This is just lovely as it is, but I seem to remember once having some mango ice cream with just a hint of honey.

Then, with the present hot weather, my canister type ice cream maker was not able to freeze the mixture (not, of course the problem of the recipe). So, I froze the mixture and then whirled it in my food processor. It is understandably not so smooth as ice cream. But the flavor also is failing to wow me. Maybe because the cherries were not as flavorful as they should have been. Maybe because, in the end, I prefer my cherries straight. I don't know.

That's right: I quadrupled the amount of sauce for the amount of veal; that was very, very wise on my part.  We still need to work on the amount of cooking time, as our veal was overcooked by my standards; however, the recipe allows one to put all simmering ingredients in one bowl in advance, which means DH can cook this for me on my birthday for a Veal Lover's Birthday meal.  In my first attempt I used pre-minced garlic, which was a pain to remove from the pan and the browned veal.  In my second attempt, I used granulated garlic.  Next time, I would use 1 garlic clove, as the recipe requested; that can't be too difficult to remove, can it?

U.S. chicken breasts are huge, so I had at least twice as much chicken as I could possibly stuff into the calzones; thank you for adding a target weight.  My red bell pepper was also somewhat larger than medium.  I found that 1/2 oz. of cheese per calzone was perfect.  The refrigerated pizza dough was thicker in some parts and thinner and broken in others, so I divided the 400g of dough into 4 100g balls and patted each out separately; I would probably roll into a circle next time, use a bowl to trim and use my handy calzone form to make a consistent closing.  I used cornmeal instead of flour so that its gritty texture would prevent the dough from sticking to the cutting board.  We loved the garlic & red bell pepper mixture and the mellow havarti.  One calzone was plenty for each hungry adult; it seemed equivalent to 2 slices of pizza.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game.",5

Vegetable flakes proved a test of will: I was unwilling to drive 15-35 minutes to buy them, and made my own equivalent based on personal preference for some spice and what I had on hand: 4 tsp grated fresh carrot, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp dried cilantro (my idea), 1 tsp dried celery, 1/2 tsp dried red pepper flakes, 1 tsp potato flakes.  All in all, the texture needs more contrast, so I would omit the celery flakes and use diced fresh celery, or use 1/4 cup cooked rice, and add 1-2 minced water chestnut slices.  A rule of thumb: each dried ingredient translates to 2x in fresh ingreients.  As made, DH declared there was too much sauce, so that's a green light to add rice.   So decide if you want diced fresh celery and/or 1/4 cup cooked rice.  Our local market had only large bell peppers, whereas medium bell peppers are much better suited to this recipe.

Tonight, I pulled out another pan to warm the beef and melt the cheese; it was easier for me to get everything to the sandwich.  I used hot dog rolls on night one, and thin-sliced Pepperidge Farm sandwich bread on night two;  I'm sure the hoagie rolls would have tasted much better, but I had too much bread on hand already.

I find the taste of the mayonnaise not fully to my liking, although I did scarf it down pretty fast - I think I would like it better with sour cream.

The premium ingredients of imported jamon serrano, Mahon cheese, and Manchego cheese all came through like stars with assertive flavor, yet complementing one another.  The piquillo chiles were canned, although I would use either roasted red bell peppers or diced pimento in a pinch.  The biggest surprise: DH and I ADORED the smoked paprika butter spread, it added sweetness while creating a gorgeous red-orange hue to the grilled bread.   I was able to use only 4 ounces total of cheese for 4 sandwiches, so I have 4 ounces of shredded cheese ready for my next project.  (Also, I think a cheese slicer rather than a grater would make it easier to layer on the cheese.)  On the flip side, the amount of paprika-butter is just enough to spread a thin schmear on each slice of bread.  When I can't get serrano ham, I would use prosciutto.  My Cuisinart Griddler recipe book recommended using thickly sliced Italian bread.  I splurged on this recipe for the most gourmet ""grilled cheese sandwich"" I have ever eaten, because ""we are worth it.""  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Gail Ann.

I did substitute about 2 tablespoons of Hormel Peppered Crumbled Bacon because I was pressed for time and didn't want to cook bacon, and I doubled the onion (personal preference), but followed the rest of the recipe as written. Really nice recipe, and I got double for my trouble !! Thanks for posting - made for ZWT8 - France, and the Herbaceous Curvaceous Honeys.",5

With a few alterations for the cook's benefit, this recipe will get the five stars it deserves.  For me, it helps a lot to list the ingredients in the order used. I added 1 teaspoon of freshly ground sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground white pepper to the flour (only needed about 1/4 cup of that).  To prevent the peeled and sliced apples from turning brown, I put them in a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish and covered them with 700 ml of Woodchuck Granny Smith Hard Cider until it was time to add them to the pot.  I would also prefer that the directions be broken into numbered steps so I can check them off as I cook (and not get lost in the directions). A rabbit has 2 larger hind legs, 2 smaller front legs, 2 5-inch by 1-inch tenderloins and 1 tiny filet mignon strip about 3/4 inch by 2 1/2 inches (TG, my hunter DH expertly cut the rabbit into serving pieces or I would have missed the exquisite filet mignon piece), and neither DH nor I would want to share the meat with even a third person.  Normally I would saute on high heat, but the 20 minutes on low prevented the meat from overcooking too quickly.  My 6-1/2-quart oval Le Creuset pot was the perfect size to fit all the pieces without crowding.  I tossed the chopped onion in with the rabbit, but I couldn't really toss it easily for browning without disturbing the meat; that didn't seem to make a difference in the end result.  Two liters of Woodchuck Granny Smith Hard Cider seemed like a lot, but it cooked down just as the recipe said it would.  My D'Artagnon rabbit from Wegman's was pricy even on sale at $5.39/lb.

One issue with the recipe,  I don't see how the popcorn amount in relation to the oil can be correct. I used the 2 TBLS of oil with a scant 1/3 cup popcorn. Using my 3 qt Revere Ware pot the oil maybe half covered the popcorn, which covered the bottom of the pot in a single layer and when popped filled the pot.  I would think you'd need a lot more oil then 2 Tbls. for 1 cup of popcorn and a huge pot to pop it in. Thanks for sharing, I may try this again with different herbs.

My only complaint is that the amount of orange zest in the recipe does not match the amount in the directions, which led to some confusion for me.

The only thing I see lacking is the amount of oil - as 3/4 cup is just not going to be enough for frying.  I used about 2 1/2 cups (maybe even a bit more) so there was enough for frying.  They are good rolled in sugar but they are great rolled in cinnamon/sugar!  Be careful as the size really has to stay around a tablespoon as any larger they are still doughy in the center but browned on the outside.  My kids scarfed them down in no time flat!

The garlic, onions and rosemary add a lot of flavor to the potatoes along with the juices from the roasting chicken.  I didn't use nearly as much rosemary as called for- 20 sprigs is a huge amount of a very assertive herb!  Instead I used 4 sprigs, each about 4 inches long.  I think that next time I would add a little white wine or broth into the bottom of the roasting dish to give a little more of the yummy sauce for the potatoes.  I also added some smoked paprika along with the salt and pepper when I seasoned the chicken- both for looks and for the yummy smokey flavor it adds.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT8",4

I probably didn't use enough of them. I also used vadalias which gave the bread a sweet taste. Since this was the first time I had ever used the bell to add anything to the dough, I paniced and thought I had missed the ding. So I added the onions as it turned out only 5 minutes before the bell went off. Now I know that bell goes of 75 minutes after I press the start button. I used unbleached bread flour and did not replace any of it with rye. I think the top of the bread didn't rise due to old yeast, no fault of the recipe.

He said he wouldn't change a thing.  I used the authentic ingredients: saffron threads, Calasparra rice, Chorizo espagnole, and small fresh mussels, as well as the green beans, artichoke hearts, roasted red bell pepper, peas.  This may be the most involved recipe I have ever made, but it was delicious.  I found directions on cleaning the mussels on Allrecipes.  I used a huge paella pan that could span 2 burners, and more or less separated the saute ingredients to areas over the burners; for the rice, I rotated the pan so that I didn't end up with overdone rice in one section and raw rice in another.  Given comments on other recipes, I was caution about the amount of saffron; next time I will be sure to use the full 1/2 teaspoon, not just a pinch.  By the way, the chorizo espagnole was spicy sweet, not just hot; it was worth the investment.  It was just the 2 of us, so I cut back on the chicken thighs and the shrimp; we ate all of the prepared shrimp and mussels.  We have a lot of leftover paella rice with chorizo and vegetables for future meals. This was my first time to fix authentic paella, as one of The Wild Bunch for ZWT8 visit in Spain.",5

We are a vinegar-loving family from the 2 year old up, and it was a perfect fit for us.

Your fig-hazelnut-apricot spread is heavenly, DH ate 1/2 cup in one sitting.  I used the best cheeses I could find: Brie, Port du Salut and Roquefort.  Once again, quality won over DH: he loved the Roquefort, but had always claimed he hated bleu cheese; he even liked the Brie, and he had also previously expressed distaste for it. In the future I would probably substitute Chevre for the Port du Salut because it was too similar to the Brie, but Port du Salut is a safe choice for picky eaters, so know your audience.

DH, who always swore he hated lamb, absolutely loved it and asked that I make these again with our leftover ground lamb.  We purchased boneless leg of lamb, which DH trimmed of all fat, accounting for 31% shrinkage in weight from our purchase; however, we had the leanest, freshest possible ground lamb for our patties, and the cost per pound was still USD$5.00 less than the ""little pieces of gold"" chops.  The vegetable filling was perfect; the sauteing helped to intensify the flavors.  The ginger was subtle, but enjoyable.  The mint was delightful, but not overwhelming.  I formed my patties the night before, and followed Bobby Flay's recommendation of making an indentation in the middle of the burger to enhance even cooking.

Thanks to a couple previous reviewers noting the company-worthiness of this recipe I chose to make it for dinner last night.  Our 5 year old's best friend and her parents were bringing grandma over to dinner and play cards while she's in town.  It's always a little difficult to cook for someone new, and to be honest, I was really nervous this time.  I was choosing a recipe that would normally be on the maybe list for my own family, simply because it's a cream sauce, and in the past we have enjoyed only a handful of white sauced recipes.  I knew I wanted chicken and pasta though, so the sun-dried tomatoes and the previous reviews pushed me to give this one a shot.  I cannot tell you how happy I am!  This recipe is SO simple to prepare.  It really only takes 10 minutes to get the onion, garlic, herbs (I used fresh basil), tomatoes, and chicken prepped.  The cooking is so easy that I was stirring the chicken/cream mixture and the boiling pasta in between hands of cards, and the end result tastes like you worked all day on it.  The sun-dried tomatoes aren't overpowering, even though I probably used an ounce or so more than called for, and the only thing we needed at the table was more salt & pepper.  In the future, I will probably cut back to 2 cups of cream, only because the sauce was a little on the thin side, and I think some crushed red pepper would compliment the coolness of the cream very well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Martha.  We'll be making it again!  *Tink",5

This combined 3 of my childhood favorites: pecans, ice cream and lemon curd, and it delivered a perfect slightly tart lemon cheesecake-style taste.  I did the ""prettier pie"" version in a 9.5"" pie plate, and quantities were perfect.  To save calories (ahem), I dispensed with the least caloric ingredient: the whipped topping; I didn't want to obscure the taste of my lemon confection.  The pecan crust was easy and was a nice counterpoint to the ice cream/lemon curd; besides, when some of it crumbled during serving, those pieces can be sprinkled on top of the pie.  I was glad I had a fitted double-boiler; that made it so easy to maintain the simmer and whisk away in the top.  But I need to get a really fast instant-read food thermometer, because it was a little tricky to wait for my thermometer to read the temperature while I continued to whisk. I used Turkey Hill Vanilla Bean ice cream - Philadelphia-style ice cream that doesn't need additional egg because their PA cows yield such rich milk. The recipe shows total time as 40 minutes, but that is misleading, as there is a 4-hour chilling time for the lemon curd; plus after each layer, I put the pie back in the freezer for 30 minutes before the next layer; and the final 2 hours of freezing.  For entertaining for the calorie-conscious, I might make this in a mini-cupcake pan or a rectangular casserole and put all of the crust on the bottom, then cutting into bite-size pieces; it could be kept cold by placing frozen chiller blocks on the bottom of a 13x9 pan, then placing a tray on top, on which the bite-size squares could be stacked.

Because the package of fruit was a bit more by weight than the recipe called for with the canned fruit, and because I thought the pulp might be more watery than the canned stuff, I added one egg to the filling as a precautionary binder. I really like the tartness of the filling with the unsweetened fruit; I think it cut the sweetness of the crust a bit. The crust was wonderfully chewy, too. Love these, love these, love these!!

This was really nice with fresh strawberries (the fruit acid cut the richness of the mousse a bit). This would make a lovely filling for a chocolate blackout-type cake. Thanks for posting!

I took the other ingredients - reducing the butter and emulsified them with my hand blender. I spread the mixture all over the chicken breasts and let it sit while I heated up the grill. I grilled the breasts with the grill set to medium- low after heating it up on high. The chicken grilled nice and evenly the coating gave it a great flavor and helped to keep it moist.

I didn't have any walnuts in the house, so I replaced them with chopped pecans. After letting the cake cool in the pan for ~15 minutes, I flipped it onto a cake platter, poked holes all over it with a skewer, and poured the glaze over the still-warm cake so it would soak in instead of drip off.

My rating is based on the presentation of the ingredients and the directions.  If low-fat milk is to be used, it should be listed as the ingredient so that the recipe's nutritional values will be accurate, and the ingredient will show up as intended on a shopping list; I used whole milk because I used the Shopping List function.  Step 1 of the directions said to combine all ingredients; when I got to step 2, which asked me to sprinkle with cinnamon, I was confused, and decided not to add more.  I used a very large Pyrex measuring bowl, and the recipe yielded 2 cups.  I liked that this used rolled oats instead of quick-cooking oats.  This recipe could become a perennial breakfast for me.  When I run out of rolled oats, I may be inspired to buy oat groats and split them using either the Vitamix dry-grains container or an Electrolux Verona Assistent Mixer with a flaker mill to have the very freshest oat taste with thicker, chewier flakes.

It reminded DH and I a bit of an alfredo dish (without all the fat--score!) but I can see how you could make a few small changes (omit the garlic, maybe add thyme or chicken broth, swap some veggies) and have a down home chicken and noodles or ""pot pie""-like dish.

The Pulparindo candy is an unusual combination of extra hot and salted tamarind pulp with a lemon edge (ingredients: sugar, tamarind pulp, corn syrup, iodized salt, citric acid, ground chilis mixture and sodium benzoate).  It is pliable and easily diced.  I found the candy at a Mexican grocer (who also had dried tamarind seeds so I could possibly have made some taffy-like candy from that).  (Note: in 2007, the FDA forced a recall of this candy for unusually high lead levels).  I toyed with using broken Werther candies and diced candied lemon instead of the Pulparindo.

First, I cooked my chicken thighs as part of Recipe #195716 #195716 to save time; the flavoring was perfect for this recipe.  I began cooking the pinto beans according to this recipe; I hadn't planned on 5 hours of soaking/cooking for the pinto beans, so after the 2 hours of soaking, I shifted to a pressure cooker: I poured the beans into the pressure cooker, added water to 2 inches above the beans, and pressure-cooked for 20 minutes; I then added the kosher salt and pressure-cooked for 10 minutes.  Since I had noted very little water left after the 2 hours of soaking,  I decided to drain the pressure-cooked beans and mash about half.  That led to nice, thick refried beans.  (If I had started with the pressure cooker at the beginning, the first round of pressure cooking would have taken only 30 minutes -- that 10 extra minutes would have shaved another 2 hours.) The beans tasted good without the use of oil or lard, a great calorie-saver over canned refried beans.  I did not use MSG, don't trust it.  Note that most pressure-cooker recipes for refried beans would have added the onion to the second pressure cooking round, and many would add 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 diced jalapeno or 2 oz. diced green chilies as well for extra zip.  In this recipe the taco seasoning provided the sole spiciness.  Assembled, the flavors came together as pure comfort food.  We are looking forward to our leftovers.  Thanks for sharing, Ingrid!

I thought if I added the cherry and cream cheese mixture, the cake would swallow the filling ingredients - not so. If I had used liners, the 1/2  way point would have been met earlier. So, the filling bubbled up and over, but no matter; the flavor shines through. Next time, (and there will be a next time) I will try to encompass the filling a little better!

We had it for lunch today, and we were all surprised how flavorful it was. I really like that it used so few ingredients and was so quick from pan to plate. I chose this recipe for the ZWT8 ~Great Backyard Barbie Challenge ~Australia/New Zealand in the Gluten Free forum because it is gluten-free as is, with the caveat of choosing a gluten-free sausage to use. So many times fillers are used in the making of sausage, so I purchased a hot italian sausage and checked with the butcher that it was gluten-free! For the challenge I made the recipe as-is, and also include here the changes I would make for the barbie: slice the sausage, peppers, onion and potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Alternate the sausage and vegetables on skewers (metal or water-soaked wooden skewers) and brush with olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with salt and fresh ground pepper and grill until sausage is cooked through and veggies are browned. Thanks for posting Lainey!

The demi-glace sauce was very good, and DH devoured the sweet potatoes and spooned up lots of beans.  I did not overcook the rack of lamb, so that was delicious, of course.   I made half the recipe for the rack of lamb and the sweet potatoes, and used all the beans (could only find 16-oz cans).  I made the full recipe for the sauce -- it is so annoying to have too little sauce, and my demi-glace sauce came in a 11.5-oz. carton.  We began ZWT8 Australia/NZ with Recipe #464247, for which we bought a leg of lamb and ground it ourselves for a net price of USD$7.00/lb, and loved our patties.  For today's recipe, the purchase price was $12.00/pound, but net of fat and bone, the little pieces of gold were about USD$45-$50/lb.  This dish is all about presentation.  It is smart to serve with mashed sweet potatoes and a bean medley, because this is not the time to overindulge on the meat portion (unless you have money to burn).  Note that the rack of lamb includes the ""filet mignon"" part of a lamb.  This recipe keeps every calorie it can: lots of butter in the mashed potatoes, and all the bacon fat from 1/4 pound of bacon in the sauce.  My reaction was to have a very modest amount of mashed potatoes and sauce, but DH couldn't get enough.   BTW, I microwaved my sweet potatoes (4 minutes plus 2 minutes more for each additional sweet potato) because I didn't want to tie up the oven.  Ended the meal with a palate cleanser, Recipe#435991.

Peppered and sizzled (the bacon grease helps with the cooking and the flavoring) this was such a delicious dinner, that I'm looking forward to the next time it is on the menu. Great payoff in flavor, for not too much work! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe, threeovens!",5

So, when I came across this recipe I figured it would work for both of my "" needs "". And I have to say it did :). Since there was just the two of us,this is how the recipe was made: I used two 4 ounce pieces of round steak which were pounded thin. Then 1 egg was beaten with about 1/4 cup of milk.The flour and seasonings were adjusted as follows: 1 cup of flour,1/2 tablespoon seasoned salt,2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 1/2 teaspoon chili powder,and1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder. For the celery salt, 1/2 teaspoon of ground celery powder was used. And instead of adding the chicken bouillon cube, I used a teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder. Speaking of the bouillon, I read the recipe wrong and added it to the flour and the rest of the seasonings. But it was an unexpected surprise, it really gave the coating a really great flavor, so I think that I'll read it "" wrong "" again. :). I served this with mashed potatoes & green beans.

I used about 12 ounces fresh cooked salmon, and since leftover mashed potatoes don't exist in my house I boiled and mashed a few. As a result they were unseasoned, and I think if you are going to use unseasoned potatoes there needs to be a bit more spice in the rest of the recipe. I added a fair amount of salt, and think more Worcestershier, some Old Bay or Cajun spices would have been even better.

I used Fage plain greek yogurt and organic mayo, so that made it nice and creamy. Loved the chopped roasted cashews too - crunch factor is a plus for me. I served open-face on gluten-free raisin bread and that really worked for me - the sweetness of the bread was a perfect compliment for the egg salad. BTW - I skipped the spinach as I didn't have any on hand, but did not miss it to be honest. Excellent recipe Cookgirl - thanks for posting. Made for ZWT8 and the Herbaceous Curvaceous Honeys!

I mixed up the ""sauce"" last night and marinaded them overnight - though my sauce came out more like paste and was not really pourable!  Not sure why...but I massaged the sauce all over the wings through the bag. I took them out of the fridge when I got home before putting them in the oven, to bring them close to room temperature. Baked them as directed and was worried they were getting a bit too charred after 35 minutes, so turned my oven down to 325 and flipped them all over. I think I could have doubled the vinegar sauce, as I was not able to liberally coat the wings, so next time I make these I will double that portion. DD didn't want anything to do with them, but ended up eating more of them than DH or me!  Just goes to show you should not judge a wing by its color! These were pretty charred looking, but the meat was tender (not dry) and they were spicy - though it was a delayed response...my mouth was a bit on fire by the time I finished my portion.

My box of ziti was a little smaller than the recipe called for but my 9 x 13 pan was filled to the rim.

I chose these as healthier than mashed potatoes, and yet they provided a wonderful potato presence next to my Recipe#126865.  First I tried cooking with ghee in my All-Clad-style chef's pan; the batter stuck stubbornly to the pan.  So I switched to a non-stick pan with a little canola oil, which worked very well.  I chose this recipe partly because my new mixer has a food processing attachment and has a shredding plate just for potatoes for potato pancakes (how could I refuse!).

I used a dark roasted Sumatran coffee bean and made sure I brewed it a bit stronger than usual.  With that and the addition of these wonderful spices (especially love the nutmeg!) and using 2% milk worked out to be a very enjoyable beverage.

The tartar is good, a bit basic but a nice flavor. The scallops were a lot of work and in the end a messy disaster. We thought the coating tasted like a cross between pancakes and doughnuts,  neither of which work with scallops. The batter came out very thick and I had to add more milk to get it to the point where I could coat the scallops. I used a deep fat fry thermometer and still the batter cooked so fast that if got very brown on the outside but the inside was still a bit moist. I tried adjusting the temp and it still didn't work . The texture was a bit like a pancake skin on scallops. They were inedible. Fortunately I cooked two small test batches so was able to save the rest of the scallops. Made for ZWT 8",2

I did reduce the oil a bit, and I omitted the cilantro since I can't abide the stuff (yep, I'm one of THOSE people!). I loved the inclusion of cauliflower in this classic dish. Next time I would like to try pureeing the tomatoes to make for a smoother ""sauce"". Also, it is totally reasonable to substitute garam masala for most of the spices in this dish (turmeric, clove, and salt excepted), which I did to make life easier.

I used a storebought shortbread crust that I put an eggwash on and baked per package instructions. I used Bird's Custard Powder, but having never tried it before, I'm not sure I made it correctly. I followed the instructions given in this recipe, but they didn't match up with the instructions on the canister. After I removed the custard mixture from the heat, I had to toss it in the blender to get rid of the lumps that I couldn't get to dissolve. Then I returned it to the pan over the heat, and continuously whisked it, and then it finally became homogenous and more thick. I may have needed to cook it even longer, because the chilled custard on the pie was still somewhat loose, but I think that's my own fault for taking it off the heat too soon. No matter, it still tasted very good. At first I thought that the custard wasn't going to be sweet enough, but I'm glad I didn't add extra sugar, because the other elements of the pie were plenty sweet. Very good, thanks for posting!

For some odd reason, I couldn't find lemon drops anywhere (I tried 4 different places), so I had to sub in some Mexican Selz candy that tastes like lemon-lime soda -- tasted fine, but not as pretty as real yellow lemon drops would've been (these candies are whitish-clear). To offset the white candies, I grated some fresh lemon zest over the trifle as well. I didn't want to fill the fridge with a bunch of breakable glasses of trifle, so I just made one in a little individual-size dish for me, and put the rest into a large glass dish.

The recipe calls for a very large amount of mint leaves to be placed on top of the drink; usually 1 sprig would suffice.  Alternatively, the mint leaves would be placed at the bottom of the glass and muddled before pouring in the blended drink, and I think that would add more dimension to the taste.

I simmered my broth mixture about 40 minutes, until the chopped mushrooms projected from the broth level.  After adding the evaporated milk, I left the heat on medium-low and waited for it to barely come to a boil, stirring periodically.

They've since made them in cinnamon and chocolate flavors, which are also really yummy with the chocolate cheese ball.  I usually set out a combination of the 3 flavors, or whichever ones are available.  This was the first time I couldn't roll it in the pecans, because one of the children has a nut allergy.  It got just as many raves as usual, but personally, I missed the pecans and felt it was too chocolatey.

This is fabulous! I sauteed the tenders in the hot sauce, as directed, using a mix of Tabasco habanero and Frank's Red-Hot. The chicken picked up the color of the sauces and after covering with cheese, I popped it in the oven and waited for the cheeses to melt. There was a nicely crispy edge, where the cheese ran off of the chicken. As we were eating, there was a flavor explosion in my MOUTH!!! So good, I know that I'll be making this again and again!

191435,ultra low fat chicken fried chicken with cream gravy,13,9,45,282.0,5.0,21.0,21.0,69.0,4.0,8.0,705251,2012-09-10,"I'm definitely giving this recipe 5 stars.  There are a few issues with your instructions though that should be corrected/edited as a new cook would not catch them and then this recipe would not turn out for them.  You listed salt/pepper up with the chicken ingredients - but don't say where to add.  You can add to the cornflake mixture but I really think it should wait until you make the gravy.  This brings up another little issue - there is no ""fat"" from cooking the chicken so placing the gravy in the pan would not work as it needs a binder - which is where the butter/margarine comes in.  After removing the chicken, I placed them in a baking dish and continued cooking/warming in the oven while I made the gravy.  Then remove the pieces of cornflakes left in the pan (the pan will be dry) and add the butter/margarine to the pan and melt till bubbling.  Now add the flour and stir until well mixed and bubbling a bit.  Slowly pour in the other wet ingredients (chicken stock and milks) and continue whisking while pouring over a med-low heat.  Once you see this starting to thicken turn the heat down lower and add the salt and pepper.  Following this method provided a smooth/silky gravy which had awesome flavor!  The chicken was so moist and the gravy took it over the top.  Better than anything a restaurant could serve !  Made for the Naked Photo Event in the Photo Forum Sept 2012.",5

As always, I tweaked the recipe to my taste and the contents of my fridge, but I loved every bite- even had to go back for seconds.  For the sauce (and I think this really defines the recipe) I made as written, only adding 1 tsp of lime juice.  It was just missing a slight bit of sourness, and I think the lime juice covered it.  Also since chili paste is kind of generic, I used sriracha- I keep it on hand and just love the flavor.  Using this, the sauce had a pleasant level of heat, and just barely made my lips tingle.  For the rest of the dish, I made a bunch of changes.  First- I used chicken breast instead of pork tender loin- I love pork, but didn't have a small piece to thaw, so chicken was it.  Second, 1 cup of bell pepper just didn't seem like enough vegetables to me, so I added some baby bok choy and and some bean sprouts that needed to be used.

I would call this Australian as it combines typical English spices with Asian spices.  In the US, beef gravy is called beef shank (sometimes cross-cut beef shank), and I used well-trimmed center cut shank (although the Australian gravy cut is boneless).  The skirt steak is the thin strip coating the ribs just behind brisket cut at the front legs, and is much more tender than flank steak that is toward the rear from the skirt (it also has more fat, just as the rib roast on the top of the animal has more fat than the loin cut behind it).  My beef shank cost $4.99/pound, but that includes the cross section of the front leg bone and lots of silverskin and tendons that require trimming (but could go into the freezer to save for beef stock).  My skirt steak was $16/pound, and that seemed costly.   This meat casserole cries for potatoes and veggies to round out the meal, so don't forget the sides.  The meat was very tender and passed DH's gristle test.  In the US some say that skirt steak is hard to find because the Applebees restaurant chain corners the market.  Next time we will try some chuck beef roast which can usually be found on sale and is easier to trim.  Or I might buy stew meat to save time.  We loved this combination of spices!

LOVED all the ingredients here (and never looked at Nutritional Facts !) -- so made up a REALLY big casserole.  At first bite, I knew this was saltier than I had expected (with sodium level at 123% daily value !) -- and took a step back.  Amazing that my previously salt-freak taste buds had changed so much !! Should have known from use of  sausage, sauce, olives, etc.  DH said all the flavors were spot on, and this would be a great combo of pizza flavors ON OCCASION for a large group !

I love the marinated tofu- once the edges are browned, the flavor is just wonderful; toasty, slightly spicy from the pepper flakes, and VERY Japanese from the marinade ingredients.  A splash of lime juice would also be yummy here, but would take it in a more Thai direction.  I started the peas, mushrooms, garlic and ginger at the same time, but I also cooked them until the peas were just barely crisp (I don't like my veggies cooked past barely crisp-tender).  Since I added  the noodles (which were a bit watery), the sauce wasn't quite as thick as I'd like it, so I might up the cornstarch just a bit next time.

Faithfully left the food processor running for 10 minutes, and poured into my 12 cup bundt pan.  The cake rose beautifully OVER the top, and turned golden in about 45 minutes.  Took another reviewer's hint, and placed a sheet of foil gently on top to prevent burning.  Baked at 350*F for 1 hour, and toothpick tested clean.  Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes, where it collapsed into 1/2 depth !!  Placed on rack to cool completely.  Interestingly, there was a ring around the cake, like it would easily slice through, and could be filled with strawberries and cream --(or some other confection !).  Didn't do this -- took to friends' home for dessert with cards, and when sliced -- DH immediately called ""That isn't done""!  Luckily I had read about the custard layer, and while this was fairly firm, I realized it had magically developed a custard-like layer !  The cake was very dense, but not at all too sweet.  I have ordered the custard powder from Amazon for next time -- it is VERY easy to put together.  Again, the the yellow section tricked my brain into expecting a lemon flavor -- so will add some extract next time.  A really nice, and very different cake !  Thanks, Kate !!",5

Instead of 1/2 lb. of sausage, 3/4 was used,and instead of red onion the same amount of sweet white was used. My SO isn't crazy about peppers of any sort,so I used a blend of red/green freeze-dried which was reconstituted to the equal amount of fresh.Other than those changes the direction part of the recipe was done exactly as it was written. And as for a change, the sauce was served over wide egg noodles. For a little extra "" Splurge "" a small amount of grated Romano Cheese was added as a garnish.And of course,garlic bread on the side.

I had frozen about a pound of the raw pasta dough to use later. I defrosted it and made it into noodles today. It was much better, and so I am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. I think what I did wrong the first time was to roll the dough too thin, and cook it too long. This time I rolled it to the setting of 4 on my pasta machine, which goes from 0 to 7. I also was more careful of the cooking time. As a result, the pasta is very nice, and the color even stayed brighter. I did have to add extra flour to the dough, which had gotten pretty sticky in the freezer. Thank you for this interesting recipe. April 23, 2012 Well, this was a lot of fun, actually. I scaled the recipe for one fairly large beet, but found that I needed to add quite a lot of extra flour in order to get a dough that could be rolled out. I did use my pasta machine, rolling the dough to a thickness of 5 out of 7. Quite a lot of the color was lost in the cooking, rather to my surprise, but still, I got pretty pink noodles. I felt the noodles were a bit lacking in tensile strength, which may have been caused by the larger amount of flour. I still have quite a lot of dough in the freezer, and am thinking of adding another egg to the mixture. I might try adding a little oil, also. I am looking forward to trying this dough to make a filled pasta, such as ravioli. BTW, the beet flavor was very very faint, which was fine with me. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.",5

I used a 9 by 9 by 1-inch rimmed pan, which was probably about half the necessary size. Nothing overflowed, but all the raisins sunk to the bottom and the cake was too fragile to get out of the pan in nice pieces. Not the recipe poster's fault, so no stars. I buttered the pan, but the cake stuck badly, so I would recommend using paper. Also, the 1 teaspoon salt called for seemed excessive to me from the start. I used 1/2 teaspoon, and think that even 1/3 teaspoon salt would be fine. Personally, I thought the cake was too sweet, and the flavor of the raisins was overshadowed by the cinnamon. I also think that modern raisins are softer than those of previous times. If I were going to make this again, I would bring 1 cup of water to a boil, add the raisins, turn off the heat and proceed from there, but with only 1/2 cup sugar (or so) and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also had quite a lot of white lumps of flour that didn't get properly mixed in. This may have been because of my carelessness, or the particular flour I used. I am using the word ""cake"" throughout this review because that's what I got. However, if baked in the proper size pan, I think you would get something more like fairly thin, rather soft bars. Anyway, I'm glad I tried this recipe. I would still be wondering about it if I hadn't. It is a very easy recipe, that uses common pantry items, too. Thank you for the experience.",0

So, I added 2-3 tbsp. of mayo and another 2 oz. or so of the cream cheese, to try to bring that flavor down a bit. I also added a touch of honey, hoping to offset the dijon.

The flavor was good, really liked the chip-to-dough ratio, but I needed to see what cooling would do for the texture. I bagged a few for home and packed the rest up for DH to bring to work and share, then called it a night. What a difference! I tried a cookie the next day, and the cakiness had entirely disappeared, leaving only chewy, chippy goodness in it's wake! Apparently these cookies need their beauty sleep, lol. Now for the technicals: both vanilla extract and nuts are mentioned in the instructions, but neither one is in the ingredient list ( not a big deal to me since I bake cookies all the time, so I added 1 tsp of vanilla and no nuts per personal preference). I thought that the bake time seemed a little long (I usually slightly underbake cookies anyhow), so I only set my timer for 9 minutes initially. Probably because of the pudding mix, I found that these definitely needed at least 11 minutes to be properly baked in my pretty accurate oven (the tops don't color as much as the pudding-free version, so look for the slight ring of golden brown at the bottom for doneness). I ended up with 38 cookies using a medium cookie scoop. I'm now on day 3 and the cookies are chewy as ever with no sign of staleness (I'm pacing myself here, normally cookies wouldn't make it beyond day 1 or 2, between home, DH's workers, and my coworkers). Iffy first impression notwithstanding, these cookies get the stamp of approval from all who've tried them. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Fall '12",5

After 90 minutes it wasn't anywhere near cooked and the liquid and onions had cooked so far down if I continued to cook it at the given temperature it would have burned. I added more wine and some beef broth turned my oven down to 330 degrees and cooked it about 2 more hours. It was too late for dinner when it was done so put it in the fridge and the next night I took out the meat and added more beef broth with water and flour to make the gravy then added the meat back in to heat it up and  served it with the mashed potatoes I had also made the night before. The high heat at the start with less liquid than I usually use for pot roast made a nice base for a dark rich gravy. Fortunately it was only my DH and me expecting dinner that night and I had something else I could serve.  Made for PRMRT,2

Of course, the flavor depends a lot on the quality of the chicken stock used. I had some homemade stock, so was able to enjoy these noodles very much. I did use rice thread noodles, rather than bean thread noodles, mainly for convenience, but also because I prefer rice noodles. And since rice noodles seem to need more cooking, I plunged them into boiling water, instead of soaking them in warm water. It worked all right for me. I also didn't have reduced sodium soy sauce, so used 2/3 of the amount given of regular soy sauce. I made up the liquid in Chinese rice wine. I do think, as the amounts are not very large, that regular soy sauce in the recipe's amount would have worked just as well. Anyway, the noodles are good. If you would like to make them more flavorful, you could add some fresh coriander leaves (xiangcai) at the very end, or increase the amount of chili. By the way, I used ground hot red chiles, not Tex/Mex style chile powder. Thank you for posting this recipe. I'm sure I'll use it often.",5

I was nervous about the raw egg, but reasoned that the hot pasta and the bacon/pancetta mixture ""cooked"" the egg (I made sure my eggs were very fresh).

I had every intention of making my usual tart crust recipe, but ended up using mini phyllo cups from the freezer instead.  The filling flavor is different with the addition of marshmallows.  It's fluffier than a traditional pumpkin pie, almost like my mother's pumpkin chiffon pie texture, and it sets up easily, but I'm not sure how much I like the texture afforded by the cornstarch.  That's just personal preference (or prejudice) against anything gelatin-like though, and did not factor into my rating because it didn't bother anyone else.  I had 24 phyllo cups that are the same size as my MINI tart pan, and I only used half the filling.  It wasn't until referring back to the recipe that I realized it was for regular sized tart shells!

I served it stuffed inside a garlic and herb flatbread pocket, with a side of your Kickin Coleslaw (Recipe #312164).  It occurred to me halfway through dinner to combine the two and add the coleslaw to the flatbread pocket with the beef.  When DH got home that's how I told him to eat it right from the beginning.

We didn't really think that the texture was doughnut-like, but more between a bagel and a doughnut.  It didn't matter though, we loved them anyway.  I went on the suggestion of the previous reviewers and added some additional apple.  I used the large grated apple in the dough as written, but after the dough cycle was complete, I kneaded in one apple cut into chucks.  Because the extra apple added more moisture to the dough, I also had to knead in some additional flour.  We wanted warm doughnuts for breakfast, so I put the dough in a greased gallon Ziploc bag and put it in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, I set the bag on the counter for several hours to let it warm up and rise.  I rolled out the dough and cut with a doughnut cutter.

I only had about 1 hour for the chocolate-scotch topping to firm up so I could cut them (was taking them to a work potluck), so I put them in the fridge while I got ready for work. Ack! When I went to cut them, I actually needed a MEAT CLEAVER to do the job! Luckily, once the bars warmed back up again, they softened back into cereal treats instead of jawbreakers, LOL. They were very tasty either way, just super-hard to chew when cold. They were snapped right up once they softened.

I used a 5 lb chicken because leftover cooked chicken is so versatile. I used the full amount of garlic stated for the seasoning rub and cavity (12 cloves total), but ultimately only used about 1 head more for the rest of the recipe -- 3 heads of garlic would've been too much for us. I omitted the rosemary because I just don't like it, but subbed in some freshly dried (not jarred) parsley for the herby element. For the veggies, I didn't have any winter squash, cippolini onions, or fennel bulbs. Instead, I used parsnips, carrots, tricolor mixed baby potatoes, leeks, red onion and celery hearts. I also didn't have any Fresno peppers on hand, but I did have some nice Italian roasting peppers that the landlord dropped off, so into the mix they went. I had to roast my chicken longer because it was bigger, but I didn't actually pay attention to how much longer it took, because I was mostly going by my in-oven meat thermometer instead. Everything came out so beautifully roasty, but sadly, I didn't remember that I wanted a photo until after the chicken was irretrievably torn apart. Since I wasn't actually making this to serve as a proper sit-down meal (I just wanted the chicken and veggies to have on hand for munching and recipes), I didn't bother to make the sauce. I will say that I was very impressed with the chicken in particular; liking the roasted veggies was a given for me, but I was surprised at just how much the flavor from the seasoning penetrated the chicken. Oftentimes, the seasoning on roasted chickens remains on the skin, leaving the meat inside bland, but not this chicken! Very pleased with this overall, thanks for posting! Made for PAC Fall '12",5

She's been gone for 4 years and stopped cooking about 5 years before she died so, needless to say, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia eating these pancakes.  We absolutely loved them.  I also cooked mine in butter, just like Mom did, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to double the recipe....my husband and I ate them in minutes and could have eaten more!  Also, I made the batter the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight...Mom always did that so she could just start right in with the cooking in the morning.

Only the 3 adults could eat it, as the kids didn't like the flavor at all.  I have to admit that I didn't read through the ingredient amounts before I tagged this recipe for PAC.  After making it though, with some adjustments, I suspect that some of the amounts called for are a little too much.   I reduced the taco seasoning to about 4 Tablespoons.  I use the homemade seasoning from Recipe #327486, which calls for 7 teaspoons per one pound of beef, so I knew that using Tablespoons of it in the chicken would be inedible.  (The difference in the chicken mixture's color between our photos is quite different! lol)  I have had a very bad experience in the past with too much liquid smoke, so I reduced that from 3-4 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon.  Unfortunately, the liquid smoke still over-powered the rest of the flavors.  I loved the idea of using lime and tequila in this recipe, but both were completely lost in the smoke flavor.

For the chicken broth I used 10 gluten-free ""Not-Chick'n"" bouillion cubes. The soup was a little thin since I didn't have the tomato puree, but this did not effect the flavor. To serve I spooned the base over a mix of aduki and pinto beans. For me, this is a very flavorful broth - and I think the additional of pasta would be nice, as suggested in the condiments list. I have a huge pot of this so will freeze half and use the other half for experimentation. I like the idea of cannelini beans and some mini pasta like ditalini or mini tortellini.

No salt is listed in the ingredients, and while I cook very low sodium, I think you need some salt in this dish, so I added maybe 1 tsp or so.  I liked the raw onion in this - I used a red one - as it retained more crunch that was nice. Loved how the spinach looked. I pan grilled these, and then made a gravy with the pan juices.

First, since I had a case of Velveeta & shells, I used 2 packages of this instead of spaghetti. I cooked the chicken as directed, and then cooked the noodles in the broth. For one version, I added rotel tomatoes (but no tomato sauce as I didn't have any). I did not add the mushrooms as I can't tolerate them, and I subbed cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom. The other version I made mostly for DD, as she does not like tomotoes in her food, so I skipped those altogether. Overall, this is a tasty meal, served with a green salad - DH really liked it.

I've made many attempts at recreating his family's version of mole rojo, but I have always gotten the same two comments across the board (too sweet, and not spicy enough). While this version isn't a perfect recreation of the family mole, this is the first pot of mole that wasn't too sweet, and was just spicy enough. Based on prior experiences, I knew that if I added all the chocolate that this batch was going to be deemed too sweet as well, so I did omit the bulk of the chocolate. I added 1 disk (~ 1.5 oz) of some Mexican dark chocolate with chipotle to the paste portion, and i didn't add any additional chocolate to the sauce part. I didn't do anything to alter the spiciness, though -- that was just due to the chiles called for in the recipe. I have to admit, I don't really care for dark mole all that much -- too much going on, and too bitter for my tastes. I will say, though, that I found this version more appealing that the others I've tried, probably because of the tomatoes (never had mole with tomatoes in it before). Since I was going into this knowing that it's a sauce that I just don't care for, my review is based purely on DH's opinion of this. I know that this is a good mole recipe, though, since I've seen enough mole being made by my Mexican in-laws. Coincidentally, I happened upon some whole frozen ducks in Costco the other day, so I made a roast duck to go with this, and some white rice. This made DH a very happy camper yesterday, so I thank you for posting this recipe. Made for PAC Fall 2012",5

DH was thrilled to see me making them, and even happier to eat them. I couldn't find any lard for the life of me (not for lack of trying, either), so I used Crisco in the masa. I was concerned that I would run out of filling too soon, so I made a double batch of it. I got 44 tamales using a large cookie scoop for the masa and a medium cookie scoop for the filling (leveled for the masa and heaping for the filling), and I was only left with maybe enough filling for 2 more tamales but no masa -- used it to make a couple quesadillas for DH. We typically like our tamales saucy, so I made a big pot of tomatillo salsa to go with these. I served them topped with the salsa, crema and some extra queso fresco. I steamed these in my big tamalera pot for two hours, but they still seemed too mushy, so I turned down the heat to low and allowed them to cook for another hour or so, then turned off the heat and left them covered on the burner overnight (I made them really late in the day, and wasn't expecting to eat them until the next day anyhow). For some reason, all the tamales I make need to be cooked like this, so I'm sure it's just a quirk of my pot and not an issue with the tamales themselves. This way, we wake up to perfectly cooked tamales and a delicious-smelling house, so the extra time it takes is worth it. Thanks for posting!",5

I used a full bottle of Patak's brand Rogan Josh Paste as the full 283gram bottle advised makes 8 serves. I would suggest cutting onion thickly and then thickening the sauce a little after cooking.

Probably nobody but me will do this, but I might as well confess. First of all, vanilla wafers are not sold in Japan, where I live. I decided to substitute a different kind of crisp cookie. The first time, I bought cookies at a neighborhood bakery. Several people have given the weight of the cookies, so I thought it would work. The cookies were in little bags with a small pouch of dessicant. Well, long story short, I luckily tasted the mixture left in the bowl after making balls. What was that hard stuff? Yes, it was beads of silica gel. Oops. So anyway, I started again today. I do think I learned something from the first experience (besides not using ingredients not called for, especially if they are inedible.) So I toasted the pecans and chopped them separately because I wanted some crunch. I broke up the cookies in the food processor, added the cocoa and powdered sugar and transferred it all to a bowl. I then cautiously added the liquids and stirred in the nuts. This time I used packaged Langue de Chat cookies, which didn't have dessicant. Although I was worried about the mixture getting sticky, it was perfect with the amounts given. I used white rum. I have tasted these, and they seem quite good, but do need some time for the flavor to develop. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.",5

I am so glad because I was a little worried it would not.  When I got to step 4 it says: :Stir in the sour orange juice, water, oregano, cumin, salt and pepper.""  There wasn't any mention of water in the ingredients so I didn't know if I should leave it out or add it.  Or how much water to use if I did add it.  So I took a chance and left it out all together.

I did use the basic idea of coating and frying chicken breast strips and putting them in sauce. I added a lot of vegetables - onion, carrot, shiitake and precooked bamboo shoot. I sauteed the vegetables first with the ginger and garlic, which I increased, and mixed in the sauce ingredients. I then fried the chicken, with potato starch, rather than cornstarch. (The two are very similar.) I used a bit more starch, but could not get a crisp crust, either. Then I put everything together, with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The chicken was tender and moist and the sauce was pleasantly tangy. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.",0

Other than the two changes I mentioned, the recipe was made exactly as written. And with the extra crabmeat, I was able to get 4 small patties. When dredging the patties in the flour they seemed like they were going to fall apart,so I used a spatula to transfer to a preheated cast iron skillet which I had added 3 Tablespoons each of the butter & olive oil.

The sour cream adds such a wonderful taste to the soup. Interestingly, I did not really taste the lime the day I made this, but it seemed more evident the next day, when I had the leftovers for lunch. I can see adding a little meat to this to make it more of a main-dish soup - you would not need a lot, with the barley providing so much nutrition.",4

Today I tried a reduced fat version containng 2 tbsp oil, 2/3 cup apple sauce (instead of butter) and  2/3 cup low fat yogurt (instead of sour cream).

Right!)  I'll have to withhold stars on this one as well until the recipe is revised. I made this using Splenda (the full 1 1/2 cups granular instead of using sugar), and the other changes I made were to substitute some chopped dried mango in place of about half the golden raisins since I didn't quite have enough (worked out fine) and to cut the amount of mango down to half a mango, which for me totalled not quite 1 cup. Also, the dough was pretty stiff before I added the mango, and I could see right there a problem taking shape, as the mango was going to cause wet spots from its chunkiness. I already had tried to work it in and realized I would have liked to have pureed the mango instead so I just amended by using an old fashioned potato masher on it (didn't want to wake the dead with the mixer).  I baked this for one hour and pulled it out. My results were that the bottom of the bread and a couple of other spots had some really wet pieces of mango. The bread itself actually turned out a bit dry which I think is from reducing the mango, (although it still needs to stay in the refrigerator so it doesn't mold from the mango chunks). Bottom line, I think the whole issue could be solved by using the full 2 cups of mango, but pureeing it like applesauce before adding it to the batter. The batter needs that moisture, just not the wet chunks. I hope this recipe works well for you in the future and that you do not lose faith in it!",0

The foil was removed then it was flipped over to get the breast side browned.  I had some MAJOR problems with my oven, It took a lot longer than the suggested roasting time for a 14lb. bird. I had to roast the bird another 3 hours..After roasting the turkey, I had a lot of broth and drippings left so a bit of gravy was made.

I bought Aussie prawns since it is Australia Day ...but they were larger than called for in the recipe- so used two prawns per tart. Sprinkled over gound sea-salt , pepper and extra lime juice to serve. A very pretty presentation that is a perfect party finger food and delicious served with a glass of bubbly.

I also added some garlic to the vegetables, which I sauteed all at the same time. I served drizzled with sriracha sauce along with a piece of nan bread. Quick easy and good.

I cut the chicken and tomato in smaller pieces, and think that the cooking went more quickly because of it. I also sauteed the garlic separately in order not to burn it, which I have a tendency to do. Just a lovely dinner. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.",5

The cooking method doesn't matter- it can be baked or cooked on a stovetop. The consistency doesn't matter- custard can be thick and creamy or thin and pourable (like the custard ""creme anglaise""). It doesn't matter if it is cooked in a bain marie or not. Thickeners such as cornstarch are often added to custards as in recipes for pastry cream (such as go in eclairs). The *eggs* are what sets custards apart, and any good chef knows that, as a chef is supposed to know 100 ways to cook an egg, one for every pleat in the chef's hat. This *may* or *may not* be an outstanding recipe, but one thing is for sure: it's a custard recipe. But don't take my word for it. Look it up.",0

First, the mustard seed for tempering is way too much- I used much less and recommend only 1 tablespoon. If you want more mustard flavor, try using mustard oil in the tempering, otherwise the soup will be chock full ofmustard seeds. Second, I don't recommend adding the powdered spices until after the onions cook, otherwise they risk burning. And the garam masala I would only stir in when the soup is done, when the lime juice is added, so the aromatic nature does not disappear. I did use a pan that was a bit large and I added more water to compensate when it started to evaporate on the rice, and that was fine. I do recommend using a firm fish steak or thick fish and avoid fillets or a fish like tilapia because thin or delicate fish tend to break apart- otherwise, just watch the fish while it cooks and remove it from heat when it is done. As for the flavor, this is quite like Thai coconut soup, very hot and very sour but it has a bit more curry flavor and is very Goan in flavor (would go great in a vindaloo meal). I would take care using both fresh chillies and chilli powder as the amounts are on the high end, although the heat in chillies will vary.

However, the execution of the recipe was a bit difficult.  I made this exactly as written and, after chilling in step #2, I had a pan full of rock solid crackers totally cemented into the pan.  So, to salvage it, I put it back into the oven, in the residual heat leftover from baking it, and left it for five minutes to hopefully soften it enough to get the stuff out.  That worked and I was then able to chisel out the crackers, which I then placed onto a wire rack so they could chill (again) so I could put them into a tin.  My plan is to take them to work tomorrow at the library as a pre-Valentine's Day treat for our patrons.....I already know they will love them!  I DO plan on making these again but will make the following changes....I'm going to use non-stick foil on the bottom of the pan because even though I greased the pan thoroughly, it still stuck like crazy.  After baking and spreading the chocolate and sprinkling the nuts, just let them cool enough to handle and they're no longer sticky-dripping and then transfer them to another sheet of non-stick foil to cool completely.  Also, I used unsalted saltines as I live in the northwoods of Wisconsin and there are no matzo crackers around, unless I order them from the internet.  I think it would be interesting to make these with Salted crackers to get that salty-sweet goodness and I plan on trying that the next time.

I served these delicious sandwiches with some homemade coleslaw. Made for Went To The Market tag game. Thanks KimmieCat! :),5

I used the exact amount of bread flour (not bread machine,) flour and whole wheat flour. For the whole wheat, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour with somewhat larger bits (called graham flour), and 3/4 cup finely milled whole wheat bread flour.

Overall they had a nice flavor though I thought the sauce flavor needed more depth compared to a similar recipe I've previously made. I ended up reducing a half cup of wine down to about a tablespoon and then deglazed the pan with some of the suace and then added a couple of TBLS of beef demi glace I get from a local butcher.  This added the extra umph that was needed. I really didn't taste much of the rosemary which surprised me since it can be so dominant. Personally I would use carrots over the parsnips next time,  they weren't worth the extra expense for me. I used olive oil for browning and sauteing the veggies (I didn't need to add any extra for the veggies). The ribs cooked out nice and tender and we delicious as left overs.

I tried one like that, then skipped doing it for the rest. We  also adore stuffed chapati so I added methi (fenugreek leaves) and sliced chillies to the dough, which gives it extra flavor without changing the outcome of the chapatis. I do recommend the griddle be almost smoking hot since it should only grill briefly, until it puffs, which it should do almost immediately. Oh, and I also didn't need that last 30 minutes of rest time, since I kept the dough nicely warm while it rested for the first hour. Thanks for sharing-",5

I doubled the recipe to make it easier to handle the half gram measurements. (Do some cooking scales measure in half grams?) This made the total flour 500 grams, of which I used only 400 grams, because the dough was a beautiful consistency at that point, and would have been ruined by more flour. I discovered that it is impossible for me to squeeze any water out of celery, no matter how finely it has been chopped. I also realized, too late that the filling made according to this recipe is way too salty. I added one more batch worth of celery and pork to make up for that. I also added a very small amount of Chinese wine for additional flavor. The celery with garlic and pork makes a very nice tasting filling, which is good, because I now have more to make up later, in the freezer. The uncooked buns looked quite promising, but most of them leaked during steaming, which did affect the appearance, though not appreciably, the flavor. Such was my adventure. With 100 grams less flour for the double batch, the yield was 18 35-grams of dough per bun. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I have been trying to perfect this kind of bun's filling, and I think I am much closer to it now. I may try adding a little potato starch or cornstarch to prevent leaking next time, as well as experiment with wrapping with the gathered seam on top, which is more common in Japan for meat-filled buns.",4

It was getting rave reviews before I had even finished serving it.  Since it's a family recipe, I understand how sometimes the little details don't get written down.  This is what I learned with this pie:  It is only enough filling for an 8-inch pie dish (I made a homemade crust in a deep-dish pie plate), although it does puff up and rise enough to sort of hide the extra crust on my 9.5-inch dish.  I didn't know if the pineapple should be drained or not, and if it was canned or fresh.  I was using fresh pineapple, so I pulsed it in the Ninja blender to crush it, and then drained all but the last 1/4 cup.  I felt that the drained pineapple made a nice custard-like filling, and the undrained pineapple added a bit of texture to the filling.  The top of the pie browned and crisped up automatically, and created a really light crunch that complimented the filling.  Thanks for sharing, mailbelle!",5

I didn't have the cheddar cheese soup so,  the same size can of Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup was used. Since we both really like broccoli, an extra 1/2 was used. I used only 2 cups of milk and the amount of ham was kept at 1 cup. Other than those changes the recipe was made as it was written.

I didn't do the drizzle; only because I forgot, but flavor-wise I didn't miss it.  These bars are half cookie/half cake texture, and plenty sweet, but that's what makes this a good copycat recipe of the Starbucks bars.  I'd much rather make them at home and know what's going in them.

Because things came up, this stood for about 3 hours. I then cubed the slabs and dredged them in cornstarch. The cubes turned into lovey brown nuggets - crispy on the outside and hardly there inside - an ephemeral creaminess. Mr Grumpy did not recognize it as tofu. I did end up using the full quantity of the sauce - do remember to stir it before throwing it in the pan - the cornstarch will settle as it stands.

So when the restaurant closed we have been on a quest almost, to find that recipe. Well this one is darn close to that recipe! It was delicious and creamy, and unlike others reviewers we felt there was just the right amount of peanut butter. We also mixed the linguini in with the peanut butter sauce and chicken. We used chives in place of the green onions It was delicious. Made for Spring PAC 2013.",5

One thing to remember with breads like this is to let them stand overnight in order to give the flavors time to meld. They are not as good eaten soon after baking!

Just fyi, the butter amount was omitted in the ingredient list, so I started off with 2 tbs of butter and kept increasing until the coffee-chocolate mixture was spreadable enough to mix with the cereals. I stopped at 6 tbs, but I suspect that up to 8 tbs (1 stick) would&#039;ve been fine. Anything less than the 6 tbs, and the coffee-chocolate mixture would have just stayed in a clump instead of distributing over the cereals. I didn&#039;t really measure out the powdered sugar, I just sprinkled a bunch of it over the coated cereal mix with my shaker cup, so the powdered sugar disappeared pretty quickly (didn&#039;t stay white like the puppy chow-type mixes). I&#039;m guessing that this would be even more delicious (albeit more fattening) with some broken Heath or Skor bars in place of the tiny toffee bits, so the toffee flavor would stand out a bit more.

One thing I do want to point out, is that the 1/2 ounce yeast, is the total amount to be used in the recipe. It kind of looks like 2 1/2-oz packages, but that is not the case. It is two 1/4-oz packages, which, by the way, is 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons worth of yeast, though probably no harm would be done by using 2 tablespoons. I would like to try more variations.

Kind of funny (embarassing, but funny): I had made the cocoa/butter mixture, pulled it from the microwave, and for some reason hadn&#039;t mentally processed that I still needed to add powdered sugar and  vanilla to it. I had read the recipe, but my brain just skipped over that part for some reason. Well, I stirred the cooked cocoa mixture, but it wasn&#039;t coming together (it was grainy and the butter was pooling out of it). Not even thinking of re-reading the recipe before panicking, I put the cocoa mixture down the disposal and started over again -- I thought maybe I had overcooked the first batch or something. Sooo, I measure out the cocoa, butter, etc and pop it back into the microwave. Only then did I go and reread the recipe and process that it was totally okay that the cocoa mixture was so thin and grainy when it came out of the microwave, since I still needed to add powdered sugar to it. I had thrown away the first batch of cocoa mixture for nothing, DOH! I think I was overtired or something, lol. Anyway, the second batch made it to fruition, and came out perfectly. I didn&#039;t have the full 2 cups of peanuts, but I added about 1 1/2 cups, which was fine. The only problem I had was that I preferred the flavor of the room temp fudge over the chilled fudge, but some of the caramel leaked out at room temp (NOT that it was such a terrible problem to have -- oh no, loose caramel!). It just made eating a bit more messy than it was when chilled. Messy or not, it was delicious fudge. Very rich, but what fudge recipe isn&#039;t? Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2013",5

I used granualted garlic and kosher salt in place of the using a little less salt than called for, I also reduced the amount of oil. The chicken juice gives amazing flavor to the veggies, and I was able to make a pan gravy from the brown bits after draining off almost all the fat. It was rich and dark and looked more like beef gravy. I put in almost a whole head of individual garlic cloves still their skins they added even more flavor squeezed into the dish.

They taste vaguely of lemon, but are not really sweet. The glaze is also very strange - equal parts of powdered sugar and water. I only tried it with a few of the rolls (and BTW, I scaled this to make 3 dozen, rather than 6 dozen). Anyway, even using half the water, this looks mainly like water, and is very thin. I dipped a few rolls in it, and then sprinkled colored sugar on them, but personally was not very impressed. With thicker, flavored frosting like that used on cinnamon rolls, these would be much better. I think they would be even better with more sugar in the dough, and maybe some kind of dried fruit, or at least more lemon zest and/or vanilla. I have been curious about these rolls for quite  a while, and am glad that my curiosity is now satisfied. Thank you.",4

I had made it on Saturday to bring to Mom&#039;s house for Easter dinner. It looked great when I finished assembling it and put it in the fridge to chill, but by the time I took it out on Sunday to take with me, it had become very liquid because the macerated strawberries kept making more juice overnight. After the car ride to Mom&#039;s house, all the toppings were just a blended drippy mess. My family is pretty good about trying stuff when I make it for them, even if it&#039;s not so cute, so the upside is that we did eat it and found out that it tasted really good. Unfortunately, if I had been serving this to anyone other than my immediate family, I would have been too embarrassed to put it on the dessert table because of it&#039;s appearance. I think for this to be successful, it either needs to be served really soon after assembly (it was a bit soft then, but it looked very pretty), or the strawberries should be added simply sliced (no sugar, no microwaving). I wish I had thought to take a photo when I had first made it, but I was waiting until I could take a picture of a cut piece instead, which I didn&#039;t end up doing for obvious reasons. It&#039;s worth a re-do, because it really does taste good, but there definitely needs to be change made to lessen the amount of strawberry juices for this to be 100% successful presentation-wise.

I did the filling in the morning and cooked the noodles, drained in cool water and set aside.  This afternoon, I put the whole thing together and baked it as indicated.

The thick-cut pork chops I used turned out a little drier than I would&#039;ve liked, but it was easily remedied by serving the meat with some salsa.

It&#039;s good warm or cold, it&#039;s colorful and fresh-tasting, and it&#039;s really easy to make. I added two pounds of shrimp instead of one because I defrosted a two-pound bag, and I used some of the salted shrimp cooking water to soak the noodles in once the shrimp were cooked.

I was trying to do too many things at once while I was waiting for the sugar mixture to boil, and I missed the start of the boil (I know, I know, the most important part of a silly-simple recipe and I screw it up :oops: ) Since I had no clue how long it had been boiling for when I caught it, I (for some unknown reason, lol) thought that it must need to be at soft ball stage. I dug up my candy thermometer and watched it until it reached that stage, and then mixed in the crushed crackers. As soon as I added the crackers, everything turned into this sweet peanut-buttery crumble that is totally wonderful on top of ice cream. It&#039;s probably great on top of cupcakes or muffins as well, I&#039;m guessing.  I know that it isn&#039;t the intended outcome of the recipe, but I loved the mistake so much that I was perfectly happy to use it as-is and let you know how good it was.

I think I needed about 8 limes-worth of juice to properly cover the fish. I also upped the jalapeno  (1/2 a pepper would&#039;ve been okay with me, but it never would&#039;ve been spicy enough for DH).  I used some fresh halibut for the fish, and I also added some diced cucumber (DH&#039;s preference in ceviches). I served this with sliced avocado, saltines, and Valentina hot sauce on the side.

I turned the heat up as indicated when I thought the meat would be almost done, but I had to increase the temp yet again, as it still didn&#039;t reach the correct internal temperature. So I upped it more and cooked another 20 minutes til it was done. I would try this again but start out with a higher temperature and see if I get a crispy skin.  I know you shouldn&#039;t eat the skin but let&#039;s face it, it is the best part.  Thanks for the recipe!",4

I chose to make it because of the key lime juice which was so good (we used it for marinating the chicken, used extra in the chili and squeezed it over our bowls). I used 3 cans of beans instead of 4.

I never made cheesecake using a blend of cream cheese and ricotta cheese.  The ricotta cheese tones down the taste of the cream cheese and gives the cheesecake a creamier texture.  The crushed pineapple and toasted coconut were the perfect compliment to the cheesecake.

I probably could&#039;ve cut down a bit on the cinnamon in the swirl layer since it was a bit strong, but still good. I ended up having to double the recipe because I was thinking of a stick of butter when I added the stick of shortening to the bowl (1/2 cup vs. 1 cup). No big deal, I just doubled up on all the other ingredients and made two loaves instead of one. The only problem I had was that my breads took quite a bit longer than 35 minutes to cook (maybe 50 minutes total) to not be liquid in the middle, so the edges got pretty dark.

Great combination of flavors here, and hearty enough to keep my serious carnivore DH happy. I had to improvise a teensy bit due to pantry item availability: I only had 1 can of tomatoes, so I supplemented it with some chopped fresh plum tomatoes.

I have to give this five stars, though, because it&#039;s got a great complex flavor that is simply amazing once you add a bit to some storebought salsa. I mixed this with some jarred Herdez salsa verde, which is pretty mild on it&#039;s own, and the end result was perfect. Spicy, but fragrant and delicious, and very similar to one of the table salsas that DH and I get at a little family-owned Mexican restaurant in Providence RI. Now that I think about it, spoonfuls of this would probably be great mixed with regular tomato salsas, ketchup, or even a mild BBQ sauce, or maybe even in a marinade for grilled chicken.

Because this sandwich is stuffed with goodies and the bread was so dense, I found that it needed to be pressed as it was cooking.

Mine was too hot, obviously, as the seeds started to pop and jump out of the pan immediately. I used some red pepper flakes rather than a whole dried chili, sauteed the rice with the rest of the ingredients and then threw everything into the rice cooker, which made for a no-stress completion of the disk. I have just a little cooker, but the larger, more powerful cookers will handle the heating of the oil and the spices right in the cooker bowl. A terrific accompaniment to our chicken this evening.",5

The flavors are somewhat different due to the fruit, but the wine is prominent.  This recipe requires a sizeable commitment to time, but the actual work is minimal.  It would help a lot if the onions and rosemary were moved to after the red wine ingredient, and the garlic cloves after them, as I had to double-check that I was including all ingredients at the right time.  I used a venison roast, which came out perfectly.  I cooked the pot roast the night before, and put the amount we planned to eat in a Corning casserole dish to reheat 30 minutes at 250 F; that gentle heating brought the temperature up without overcooking the meat.  I served over extra wide egg noodles.  It appears that Prosek dessert wine is no longer available; my internet search convinced me to use a Marsala Ambra, so I used the sweet red version.  Note that we detected no gaminess in our venison, so this dish was a winner for us.  I was happy that the dish did not taste overly fruity; the dried plums dissolved into the sauce.

The temperature in my kitchen also was a little cool today, so it took the buns longer than I expected to rise. The baked buns, however, are very nice, light, fluffy and certainly not greasy. I haven&#039;t bothered with the glaze. I think the buns are delicious without. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.

I made khinkali with ground lamb and cilantro. At first I tried with smaller wrappers (3 1/2-inch rounds). They were not easy to wrap, and the amount of meat too little. I later tried with 5 1/2-inch rounds. These worked much better, and I could still roll the dough out on my pasta machine. The second time around, I added some dried  fenugreek leaves and red chili powder to the meat mixture. I like that better than only cilantro, salt and pepper. I did add 2 tablespoons water (I made a half-batch) to the meat. I suppose the reason for the water is to keep the meat moist. I am glad I didn&#039;t add more. I&#039;m not sure any is necessary, but think that soup stock might work better if a liquid is to be added. The amount of water to make the wrappers is insufficient. I needed about 1/4 cup more for the half-batch I made, and I kept the dough very stiff. Although the dough was stiff, it was very easy to work with, using my pasta machine, and was not sticky at all. Overall, this is a good recipe and results in delicious dumplings. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. The pictures show both the larger and smaller dumplings on the same plate.",5

It looked pretty good at first, but there seem to be some things missing. First, the step to strain the sauce is missing. I can&#039;t imagine trying to eat the noodles while avoiding bits of ginger, garlic and onion. So I did strain it, but then, it looked like there might not be enough. You don&#039;t use such a lot of sauce on this kind of noodles, but, even for 2 servings, I think it is a close thing. I haven&#039;t experimented, but I think I&#039;d prefer the sauce to have a stronger vinegar taste, too. The next big thing is that the recipe suggests that you eat the noodles with only cucumber (or carrot) and coriander leaves. If this is a light meal, which is how I would treat this kind of dish, then I&#039;d like cucumber, ham, egg, tomato, pickled ginger, and maybe even a few slices of roast chicken, along with the coriander. And with hot Chinese mustard on the side. Sprinkling sesame seeds over the top is fine.

My &quot;audience&quot; was divided, some agreed that they were on the a little on the heavy dry side, but some really enjoyed them as-is. I probably would&#039;ve given only 3 stars for texture, but I think they have 5 star flavor and would be easily adjusted to my tastes texture-wise, hence the four star rating.

I used all the rye meal and all other ingredients in the listed quantities, except the white flour. I used bread flour, and added some in beginning, when the recipe said to, then added everything else, and finished with the rest of the flour. The dough was becoming stiff, so I used only about 3 2/3 cups flour, total. By the way, the instructions don&#039;t say anything about adding the salt, and the rye meal isn&#039;t mentioned clearly (is it included in &quot;flour&quot;?) either. Nonetheless, I managed to get 2 loaves of 615 grams each and 2 small loaves of 230 grams each. The two loaves this recipe makes are quite big.

Because it was so soupy, the gravy part flooded over the potatoes as it cooked so I drained some of the gravy off and then continued cooking.

I&#039;m still new to Indian cooking (although obsessed with it), but I would introduce the coconut milk earlier to allow all to simmer longer and let the coconut milk to reduce.

For the white chocolate orange version, I used some high-quality bulk white chocolate, and Cointreau for the liqueur. It&#039;s delicious with the liqueur in it, albeit a tad boozy, but it also tastes pretty good if you omit the alcohol. This version thickens when cold, but still stays liquid. You just have to be sure to give it a stir before using once it&#039;s cooled, or all the orange zest will be sitting at the bottom of the container. I used this on some lemon frozen Greek yogurt, but I&#039;m thinking that this might be a nice sauce for some  crepes, too.  The chocolate coffee version was great as well (I served this on some coffee ice cream). I used Kahlua, coffee extract, and some Scharffen-Berger bittersweet squares. I contemplated omitting the coffee extract, thinking it might only be necessary if the brandy is used in place of the coffee liqueur. The Kahlua alone didn&#039;t give it as much coffee flavor as I wanted, so in went the coffee extract too. This version gets pretty firm once chilled, so it needs to be warmed up before serving.

My daughter-in-law couldn&#039;t find a 4 lb roast, so she bought 2 2-lb roasts from Wegman&#039;s, and she used a tri-ply Dutch oven.  Apparently she got a bad cut from Wegman&#039;s (SHOCK!), and the roast was disappointing.  I found a 4.2 lb roast at our local Amish market, and used my 6 1/2-qt oval Le Creuset Dutch oven.  The roast nestled perfectly in the pot, but it was a bit tricky to turn it over - make sure you have some heavy-duty claws to control this much meat.  The first time we ate the roast as soon as it finished cooking: the sauce seemed too sweet to me.  The second time I froze everything and then reheated in a 200F oven for 5 hours to avoid overcooking the beef.  The beef was perfectly tender (I cut off serving size chunks with a plastic spatula), and the sauce had mellowed to perfection.  There is so much sauce!  There is still plenty of room for large chunks of potato. (The pot made a difference too.  Note that Costco is currently selling a Kirkland 8-quart enamel-coated cast iron pot for $60, which I presented to my step-daughter.)  So we adopted this as a meal our 2 households will share together, with the pot roast made ahead and frozen until our dinner date.",5

We eat chicken at least 2 times per week and often 3 times so I am always looking for a recipe to meet the day&#039;s demands.  I LOVED this recipe.  The flavors imparted from the herbs were wonderful.  My house smelled so good and it was mouthwatering to come home to after a Roswell Cancer Institute visit :-(  knowing dinner would be done and simple.  Hubby loved this as much as me for taste although I love the simplicity of making it. I used fresh cut rosemary and thyme ads I just purhcased these plants for the gardens so simple is as simple does.  I did add in quartered potatoes to the bottom of the crock as well making dinner that much simpler so only veggies need to be steamed for dinner.  The taters took on the flavors of the herbs as well and I LOVE rosemary taters.  This will be in my go to monthly chicken dinner menu.  I can see changing up the herbs to suit the moods so it will also be a fun recipe to make with and without taters maybe adding in some root veggies to complete the meals.  Thank you.

I made this recipe twice, but the variations were pretty much the same.  I wanted to use some of my homemade caramel for a salted caramel brownie.  The first time I made this I used raw cacao and dropped about two teaspoons of homemade caramel into the middle of the mixed batter.  The raw cacao is something I only use in raw desserts, and it&#039;s always just too dark chocolate tasting for me.  However, I was making this for my son&#039;s quick dessert fix, so it was fine for him.  I didn&#039;t photograph it though, because it was pretty ugly.  The caramel oozed everywhere, making the cooked brownie spread out on the plate in a sloppy mess.  He said it was delicious, despite its look.  The second time I made it, I used my favorite Dutch processed cocoa powder, and saved my caramel for drizzling on the plate and over the cooked dessert instead.  The flavor was more my taste and the caramel didn&#039;t make the brownie fall apart.  My one concern is not being able to get the whole brownie out of the cup.  I think I&#039;ll try spraying it with some non-stick spray next time.  My daughter and I enjoyed the second brownie together.  :)  Thanks for sharing, Alaina!

The sauce is very much like the dressing my mother always made, only she also included chopped scallion. Although it was just me for dinner, I made the whole batch of the sauce. I used it as is on the meat, then added some chopped scalion and used that on a green salad and on some steamed potatoes. I used kefir instead of the buttermilk, but that is not a significant change. Very nice and fresh tasting. You might want to make more of it if using for four servings of meat - you might find yourself wanting more of it.",4

The amount of sauce is not going to be enough for the 4 lbs of fish the recipe calls for. And 1 lb of fish is really an enormous amount, as fish fillets have no waste.

I wondered how good it could be with just basic ingredients, no extra seasonings, meat or veggies. I even put a Italian seasoning grinder on when I set the table, just in case.  Well, no one needed it.  A basic but terrific lasagna.  UPDATE: When I made it tonight I altered it a little because my fridge/freezer went out and I needed to use things up. I probably used more of some ingredients than called for. My cottage cheese was low fat. I had about 1/4 of a green bell pepper, and a couple of slices of sweet onion that I diced and sauteed. I added them to some veggie crumbles I had left over and put them in the center layer of the lasagna.  It still made a great lasagna, everyone went back for seconds!  DD even asked if we could have it again this week.  Served with garlic bread and salad.",4

A wonderful blend of spices with a nice tang from the chile / cayenne that went wonderfully with the steak. I noticed step 2 mentioned cooking until the water was evaporated but the spice / paste mix was quite thick so I added a few tablespoons of water that helped incorporate it with the onions well.

The picture I posted should have shown even more liquid to be fair. Now, I hate splitting hairs about names, and actually prefer stews with little or no thickening. This does seem to exceed the limits for wateryness. Other than that, it wasn&#039;t hard to make, and the flavor is acceptable. I did reduce the amount of saffron, because mine is fine ground, not in threads, and can be ferocious. I also cut the amounts of turmeric and mustard, though I suppose I could have left them as is. The flavor does not seem to be lacking in spice, though. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us. It was educational.",4

I think this would best serve four people unless you served with some fruit or another side.

I made it in a 5 quart slow cooker, and my springform pan fit in well, with an inch or so on the narrow sides. I did not have a rack that fit, so used canning jar bands. These are just about 1/2 &quot; high, which makes it easy to judge how much water to add. I also always put aluminum foil around the pan, to avoid any leaking. It was very quick to make, and then you just had to wait for it to steam and then cool. I hope to make different versions of this, as making it in the slow cooker is so much better than using an oven in the summer.  Update: I made this again, but swirled some Nutella through the batter, creating a marbled effect - oh, man - was this ever good! I thinned the Nutella with some cream to make it easier to swirl.",5

The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars in my book is that it is a little thin- more vinegar than oil instead of the other way around.

One batch was enough for one very large red onion, 10 sea scallops and one fairly small potato, with a little left over. By the time I got to the potato, though, the batter was almost completely deflated. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. I forgot to add - the batter didn&#039;t stay on the first few onion rings very well, so I dusted them with flour. They were fine after that.

The downside of this is that there is nothing saucy about it, so I was a teensy bit disappointed when I took it from the oven, after reading the name and all.  The disappointment passed quickly once I tasted it, though! I generally like bread pudding, but sometimes it&#039;s too eggy. This wasn&#039;t eggy at all. It was drier than most bread puddings I&#039;ve tried, but not in a bad way. It really reminded me of a Toll House pan cookie, actually. I used a loaf of brioche, chopped bittersweet Scharffen-Berger squares and some Whole Foods brand white chocolate chunks (too lazy to chop up the hunk of Callebaut in the cabinet). I made a mistake when adding the cream -- apparently my reading comprehension was set for low when making this. My milk had given up the ghost, so I used just the cream. I didn&#039;t realize until it was too late that I was supposed to divide the cream, though, so I added all the cream to the bread and chocolate mixture (plus the 1/2 cup extra to make up for the missing milk :shock: ). I let this sit in the fridge overnight, and then I still added 1/2 cup of cream to the top right before baking. Oh, and I used a packet of Dr. Oetker&#039;s Vanilla Sugar for the topping, just because I could. Even with all the extra cream in this, there was still no sauce to be found, but I didn&#039;t care!

Either making it early in the day and letting it sit, or adding more seasoning was the general consensus.  Also, (not part of the rating) choose a strong pita that will hold up to being filled without falling apart.

The vinegar was a little bit strong, but it might have just been the particular one I used. I would make this again -- the spice and meat in it make it a definite guy pleaser. Thanks for posting!

Even so, the baking powder should be near the flour. Also, I think the addition of a little salt and perhaps vanilla would be nice. Or some kind of flavor. JMO Then, more detailed instructions would be nice, too. I watched you-tube videos to fill in what is missing here. Lastly, and not related to the star rating, people who don&#039;t like &quot;eggy&quot; cakes would do best to avoid this recipe. Thank you for posting the recipe. I now think that if I work at it, I may be able to make rolled cakes I can bear to show others.",4

I used about 1/3 dried cherries and a balance of dried cranberries only because the cherries were down to the bottom of the bag. I really liked the sweet tartness of the cherries with the almond flavor. I sprinkle the top with raw sugar and a little regular cinnamon sugar. I don&#039;t usually like and egg glaze but this along with sugar provide the crunch that these needed to contrast with the soft texture. Lovely scones, thanks Annacia for sharing!

I seared the pork over the flame on the grill first then moved it to the no flame side. I kept the BBQ between 350 and 400; I have an old grill and put an oven thermometer inside to keep track and use a digital probe thermometer so I could pull it out right at 155 degrees and then let it rest for 10 minutes.

I used cod this time and plan on trying it with shrimp and scallops next. Something I learned the hard way: do not use light butter! I&#039;ve never had a problem cooking with light butter before but it did not work in this recipe. The resulting sauce was overwhelmingly lemony (as in sucking a lemon straight lemony!). I &quot;saved&quot; it by adding more wine, garlic and real butter along with some salt, pepper and even some sugar. I served the fish and sauce over linguine with a side of yellow squash and zucchini saut&eacute;ed in olive oil and Mrs. Dash&#039;s lemon pepper seasoning. Excellent supper! Thanks!",3

I used low fat coconut milk so added a splash of heavy cream to the marinade I was cooking down to give it a little more body.

The boiling step brought out what my husband called a &quot;smell&quot; that  prevented him from eating. I think it brought the marrow out of the bones or something. I am not sure if this is specific to the cut of meat, so I am not assigning stars. It would be about a 2 otherwise. I used half of the spice listed and Recipe #287041 instead of the sauce. I also think the oven time after boiling was a bit excessive. I did broil for 15 minutes on each side, but had to move the oven rack down after the first 15 minutes. The meat wasn&#039;t tasty. It was a bit too tough on the outside and tasted boiled on the inside. The spices that I added to the water did come through, so maybe I just need to brine the wings instead of boiling them.",0

I have a chef&#039;s super pot, which can handle oversized wok dishes.  This recipe was for 6-8 servings, and should have fit the pot. (If only I had used my 6.75-quart Dutch oven!)  4 cups of uncooked rice and 8 cups chicken broth  were too much in proportion to the chicken and sausage, and they raised the ingredients/liquid level to less than 1/4&quot; of the top.  As a result, I had to leave the top cock-eyed so the pot wouldn&#039;t boil over; it took an additional 15 minutes to cook the dish.  In the end, there was a vast amount of rice for the protein.  Unless you have a lot of &quot;starving students&quot;, cut the rice down to 3 cups, and the chicken broth down to 6 cups.  The recipe&#039;s step 1 asked to &quot;heat the oil in a skillet.&quot; No oil was mentioned in the ingredients.  Next measuring quandary: in step 2, the chicken was to be sprinkled with Cajun seasoning, was this the same seasoning listed under the cayenne pepper?  I used the 1/2 Tbsp. Cajun seasoning in a bag to shake the chicken cubes for distribution.  Then as the chicken cooked, I sprinkled more seasoning.  I wish the recipe had given better instruction.  I shook on some gumbo file, which was  a valuable contribution to this dish. Next time I would use a more interesting sausage and reduce the uncooked rice to 3 cups.

All of the meat eaters in the house enjoyed this very much, and I loved hearing DH&#039;s contented sigh at the end of the meal!

The hickory smoke added great flavor and I would recommend it.  Next time, however, I will only use 2 stalks of celery. We all felt that 3 was too much.  Served with Cajun Jalapeno Poppers.",4

I didn&#039;t have the called for bread crumbs so I used a mix of panko and fresh ground Italian seasoning.  While they took longer to cook than called for, they were a success.

The flavor was a definite 5 stars, but the end product was physically more like 2 or 3 stars, so I&#039;d rather go with a no-stars comment than give it a low rating. I made this using coconut milk in place of the dairy milk because it I had some to use up, but it never fully set up to be a proper clafouti (even after baking it for an extra 30 minutes!). It wasn&#039;t pretty, but I&#039;m really glad that I didn&#039;t call it a wash based on appearances, because it tasted marvelous! Once I cut into it, I found that there was a thin layer at the bottom that had kind of turned into clafouti proper, but there was a lot of residual liquid once I removed some from the dish. It wasn&#039;t the most attractive thing I&#039;ve ever made, but we still ate nearly the whole dish. I&#039;d definitely like to try this again using the dairy milk instead (maybe with a bit of coconut extract to make up for the missing coconut flavor?), because the flavor of this was just too good to not try making this again the right way. I will definitely re-review this once I make it with the milk. No photo for now, for obvious reasons, sorry. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks",0

I thought that there was a lot of steps for a dish that turned out just OK.  I was not as blown away with this recipe as I truly wanted to be.  My cuts of meat were on the large side and so I ended up under cooking the meat, so I set the cut pieces simmer in the tomato broth while the pasta was being cooked.  I used pappardelle pasta....which again, was not the best of choice for pasta. But the biggest complaint was that DH mentioned that he has never really fond of Beef Stroganoff....well, ya think he could have mentioned that little tidbit somewhere in the last 35 years of marriage....I mean, geeze !!!!  If you plan on making this dish, do cut off all the fat and silver skin from the meat.  It really did make a difference, as I had left a little bit on and that piece became hard and chewy!

My cream of mushroom was reduced fat (some nonsense that someone left in my pantry) and I had Greek yogurt in the house instead of sour cream. I added some Recipe #16261 to the sauce for extra flavor. I baked the chicken at 425&#039; to go with Recipe #214215. It was done in about 30 minutes, but the top of the sauce got a bit dried out.

A great find at a local market!&lt;br/&gt;I think I may have over steamed them just a fraction, because when added to the pan with the sugar and butter mix, I had to be extra careful they did not break up.

I added the flour in with the spices (the recipe does not state where to use it), since I had kids at the table I reduced the cayenne pepper to around 1/3 of a tsp. That was a mistake as I could not detect the cayenne at all. Next time I will add 2/3 tsp or the full amount. I added some dots of butter to the pan (was not sure if the butter should be melted or smeared on the pan). The butter adds a delicious buttery flavour and helps with the crisping. Next time I might also use some bread crumbs instead of some of the flour to get an even crisper, coarser crust. All this said - the wings are very very good!",5

I would rate the spiciness as &quot;2-Alarms&quot; (based on Wick Fowler&#039;s Two-Alarm Chili, which is as fiery as we can eat without adverse consequences).  By Indian standards, this is not very fiery at all.  So, for our tame tastebuds, DH declared that the recipe&#039;s spiciness added to his enjoyment of the dish and should be kept as is.  (If we had needed to tone it down, we could reduce the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon.)  This one goes into our &quot;A-1 Rotation&quot; cookbook, what a nice find!  Made for 2013 My Three Chefs.",5

The bread LOOKED uncooked, but I think it was the melted vanilla baking chips which made it look poorly mixed, after reading another review.  It WAS very dense and tough, but the combo of flavors was pretty good.  I was disappointed, too -- &#039;cause I like to use breads as gits for holidays as well.  Some clever &quot;chemist-type&quot; baker could adjust the proportions to improve the consistency, but that is not one of my strengths.

I also used evaporated milk instead of the cream - it provides much the same mouthfeel, but saves on calories. Also, I put the curry and turmeric in with the onions just as they became tender. I find that heating the curry in a little fat really enhances the flavors. I also added a couple of garlic cloves, as they go with the rest of the ingredients, and I had half a bulb of garlic sitting on the counter. I might up the amount of pumpkin next time, just to provide a bit more &quot;heft&quot; to the soup, but it was good just as it is.",5

I tweaked it by skipping on the mixed veggies and adding a can of Progresso Vegetarian Vegetable soup instead (used Progresso Minestrone for the other) - that adds a little bit of pasta and more veggies without all the salt from the can of mixed veggies.

Used venison tenderloin (cut into large bite-size pieces) instead of marketing-jacked-up-price blade steak, and frozen green beans and cauliflower, thawed during prep time.  It tasted very good, although the venison overcooked due to 5 minutes extra time necessary to cook still partially frozen veggies.  The spices didn&#039;t have time to blend together perfectly.  Next time I would: 1) chop the cauliflower so finely that it would just become part of the sauce; 2) cut the venison into even larger chunks; 3) completely thaw the veggies prior to cooking.  I doubled the recipe, using 1 can of drained of diced tomatoes, amounting to 256g instead of 290g.  I would move direction 4 above direction 3.  It seemed odd to cut my 200g squash into 8 pieces rather than slicing coins, given the finer dicing of the other veggies; is that what you intended?  DH said the spiciness was perfect.

I always have an overabundance of eggs from my chickens, so I&#039;m constantly looking for recipes to use them.  I was really glad to stumble upon this yummy recipe.  I made the recipe as written, with a few minor changes.  I added 3/4 tsp. baking powder to the egg/ cream mixture. I always do this when I make scrambled eggs or omelets as I think it makes for fluffier eggs.  Also, I used 4-cheese Mexican blend instead of the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. I used the optional bacon and cooked it all in my 12&quot; cast iron skillet. I served the scramble topped with salsa and creme fraiche for a delicious, filling breakfast.

The crust was very easy and delicious for a pastry-challenged chef like me.  I could not find my 10&quot; pie plate/flan plate, so I used a 9&quot; pie plate, using all the crust, all the cheese, all the veggies.  My milk had spoiled so I used half and half, and mixed it with the 3 eggs.  While pouring over the other ingredients, I stopped when the level neared the top; I had over 1/2 cup of liquid to discard.

I do think it&#039;s quite nice. However, if you are looking for a strong pumpkin flavor, you should look elsewhere. The flavor of this bread is complex, and interesting. The color and texture are very good. I used homecooked Asian pumpkin (kabocha), and followed a recipe here for the pumpkin pie spice. I did add a small amount of salt, and scaled the recipe by 1.5. I did not change anything else. The yield was two medium loaves and 11 small muffins. One thing it is important to note is that this type of quick bread is much better the following day, when the flavors are beginning to meld. A mini food processor was very useful in the preparation.

But I came home very frazzled and very short of time. So I made this dish with - yes - hot dogs. And you know what - it was a delicious way to make hot dogs. I reduced the temp to 350 deg., and made half the sauce for four hot dogs - not enough sauce. I would think you would double, triple or quadruple it - I would have liked some to dip the chunks of sausage into. I think I roasted them 20 minutes total - did not do the first preroast, just put it in the oven with the sauce. This makes a quick pantry dinner seem like something special.

DH said it&#039;s even better than any one he&#039;s ever eaten at a restaurant.  DD (7 yrs old), who rarely eats red meat, could not keep her hands off the carving board and had eaten a meal&#039;s worth by the time we sat down!  She also helped me make the recipe, which was easy using Pammy&#039;s calculation method.  I had a 4.59 lb roast, which calculated out to  23 minute cook-time.  The sear it put on the outside of the roast was fabulous, although my kitchen was quickly filling with smoke.  We had all the doors and windows open, the exhaust fan on, and the smoke detector disabled, but it was all worth it.  Next time I may let the meat roast just a couple minutes more, as it was just a tad bit rarer than I like, but I prefer the end pieces with all the spices anyway, so this one had something for everyone.  I really can&#039;t say enough about this.  It&#039;s a $40 piece of meat and I did not want to screw it up.  I trusted Pammy though, and I have never had a prime rib melt in my mouth like this one did.  It will be the only way we prepare it from now on.

For potatoes I used red potatoes. I didn&#039;t add celery cause I didn&#039;t have any. I cut the veggies into chunks instead of dicing. Smells great simmering on the stove! Yum!",5

We aren&#039;t going to get to eat this batch, but I&#039;ll definitely try it again this weekend.  The first change I&#039;ll have to make is not using my jelly roll pan.  The crackers (I used Saltines, cause I liked the idea of having the salt and they were on hand) did not cover the whole pan, so they slid around and separated after pouring on the hot toffee.  I put the pan in the oven for the 15 minutes, but will cut it way back next time, to check it first at 5 minutes and then probably continue to 10 total, but by 15 it smelled like it had burned.  We couldn&#039;t tell however, because my jelly roll pan is black, so we put it in the refrigerator.  We could hardly wait to try it, but when we took it out of the fridge it was rock hard and stuck to the greased pan.  I had to use a metal dough scraper to try to cut through the toffee between some crackers that had separated and when it popped out it was burned black on the bottom.  :(  We were so bummed!  I tried it anyway, but had to spit it out.  I&#039;ve got to buy more butter (used up 2.5 lbs baking today) and then we&#039;ll try it again with a smaller pan, probably lined with foil instead of greased, and adjusted timing for my oven.  I have no doubt this will be a killer recipe once I get it right.  Maybe I&#039;ll get the Matzo crackers while I&#039;m at the store.  UPDATE:  November 17, 2013:  Okay, I stuck with the Saltines, but tried this again with the following changes:  13x9 baking dish lined with foil greased with butter (instead of the non-stick spray), lowered the temperature on my oven to 325&deg; and baked for 15 minutes.  The results this time were perfect!  I really like the salted caramel flavor from using the Saltines.  I&#039;m so glad I tried this again.  Made during the Cookathon in Pammy&#039;s memory.

Pandoro is generally sold locally only from Thanksgiving week through Christmas, so I was curious to try it.  I checked out several recipes, which all described genuine Pandoro as &quot;very difficult&quot; and requiring 2-3 days to make; given that intense effort, it made sense to buy the Balocco il Pandoro at my neighborhood Italian restaurant. The restaurant owner said to put the cake in the oven with the icing sugar after removing the turkey and turning off the heat for a simple holiday dessert; leftovers can then be used for this recipe. I love the light lemon/citron flavor of this Pandoro, which contributed to a full-flavored French toast with minimal effort.  Now that I have tasted genuine Pandoro, I plan to try an Italian recipe I am still translating for comparison.  Note: if serving for a holiday brunch, the Pandoro slices can be sliced into sticks the size of fish sticks so more can be cooked at one time.

I made a triple batch of these noodles to use for chicken and noodles.  I made the noodle recipe on Sunday morning and didn&#039;t cook them until Tuesday morning.  I rolled and cut out the dough and layered them in a rectangular plastic container with sheets of wax paper between each layer and then stored them in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook them.  I boiled two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in chicken broth until they were done, shredded them and stored them in the refrigerator too.  Two days later, I boiled a big pot of chicken broth (I think it was approximately 60 oz.) and dropped the noodles in one at a time.  Once all the noodles were cooked I added the shredded chicken.  Then I took a 4.5 oz packed of peppered gravy, mixed it with some of the chicken broth until it was smooth and added it to the chicken and noodles to thicken up the sauce.  I put it all in my 6 quart crock pot and set it on low for 2 hours.  I took the crock pot to work and set it on warm.  The chicken and noodles sat in the crock pot from 5:00 a.m until lunch time (12:00 p.m.).  About 1 1/2 - 2 hours before serving time I moved the temperature from warm to low to heat the noodles up more.  At this time I had to add water to the noodles because they were getting a little dry.  When it was time to serve the dishes, the noodles were perfect...they did not disintergrate and get mushy...they were soft but still had a &quot;bite&quot; to them.  Everyone raved about the noodles and they were all gone except for a thin layer at the bottom of the crock pot.  TIP:  Use a plastic crock pot liner to make clean up easier.  I am making the chicken and noodles again for my family&#039;s Thanksgiving feast.  This one is definitely goiing into my keeper file.  Thanks, kindcook, for an awesome recipe!",5

Instead of processed cheese, I used 3 cups sharp white cheddar cheese, 1 1/2 cups swiss cheese-gruyere, and 1 1/2 cups smoked provolone (a combination simulating Provel processed cheese, but using premium ingredients).  Because this was a crockpot meal, I scooped out portions.  We had a hard time finding the cheese, and the special flavors of the cheeses were lost.  So for this recipe, I would use orange cheddar cheese or cut up Velveeta, and not try to add a gourmet touch.  I was glad that the recipe did not call for additional salt because the canned soup and the cheese gave it enough. I like to see my cheese, and know that each portion is getting its share, so I would not add the cheese to the crockpot, but put each dinner portion in a French Onion Soup bowl, sprinkle the cheese, and melt under the broiler or in the oven.

Although my Filling butter had been at room temperature over a day, I couldn&#039;t spread it, so I melted it; I ended up using only a thin layer of butter with the filling, and it didn&#039;t seem to matter.  After rolling up the dough with the filling, I refrigerated it for an hour to allow cleaner slicing.  Our house stays at 62F on cold days, so it took 2 hours for my rolls to rise.  But, everything came out just fine anyway!  Note: I baked the rolls in a standard metal 13x9 pan, but inverted the pan onto a 13x9 Gladware pan for travelling; the pans didn&#039;t match up exactly, allowing some of the goo to escape on inversion.  The inversion made a belly flop splash and required immediate cleanup before the goo solidified.  Good time to wear an apron... Just keep this in mind.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.",5

Between the original ingredients list and the tips in Step 4, it was very confusing.  Fortunately I had all necessary ingredients on hand because I rely on the Food.com Shopping List.  I used 2 tablespoons flour, 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, the sugars, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 dash freshly grated nutmeg, 1 pinch ground allspice, 1 pinch ground cloves and 1 Tbsp. vanilla.  I beat 1 egg white to glaze the bottom crust and baked that 2 minutes before loading filling.  My 8 Granny Smith apples weighed 4.32 lbs, and seemed 2 stories high stacked in the pie plate, although by serving time they settled into a plump mound above the top of the pie plate. (Eight medium Granny Smith apples would weight 3 lbs according the the USDA nutrient database.)  My lattice top crust perched atop the apple pile, and I could not crimp edges.  I gave up on brushing milk on the top crust.  The lattice design was lost by the time the pie emerged from the oven.  My guests LOVED the sauce on the top crust.  Although the pie had cooled completely prior to serving, the sauce did not congeal, but stayed a (delicious) gooey liquid.  Although I baked the pie for more than the maximum time, my guests said the apples were slightly undercooked.  My guests said there was no need to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the crust.  I liked that this apple pie was definitely an APPLE PIE in which the apples dominated the sauce.  I used a Wegman&#039;s double-pie crust, and was very pleased with it; my guests suggested making a focaccia with the crust topped by the sauce.  I am not used to baking, but I will make this pie again, as our group can&#039;t get enough apple pie. As for the recipe and its many tips, I recommend creating a separate recipe for &quot;Apple Pie GRPA #2&quot; and for &quot;Apple Pie GRPA #3&quot;.

DH was concerned with the cream cheese but I added it anyway and he enjoyed it immensely.I followed directions almost to a T however 2 things, omitted mushrooms, and cooked less than 20 min on low heat.  We use propane as there is no natural gas where Ilive so it does cook a bit hotter but 30 min. seemed a bit long.  Omelette came out fluffy and high.  I did a very short flip over to make sure all egg was cooked les than 30 sec. with the heat off just before plating.  DH was quite impressed.  This is a 5 star all the way!  I will make this again for him on a nice Sunday morning or perhaps for Christmas breakfast when the kids are here.  I will probably precook the taters so I can get the omelettes finished quicker as I can only do 1 at a time.  Thank you for a lovely recipe.

In fact, after his first bite, my husband declared that they were his new favorite waffle.  We loved them served with the Dutch honey, even though I had to make a couple of changes.  I went to the cupboard to get my maple syrup and found that I was all out.  I ended up using maple pancake syrup instead.  Because pancake syrup is so much sweeter than maple syrup, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I probably could have omitted the sugar altogether because it was plenty sweet.  I can&#039;t wait to try this with real maple syrup.  This recipe makes a lot (I got 30 4&quot; waffles), so I froze the rest to enjoy later.

Enjoyable, but I think if I improved my rising technique it would be even better.  Used Woodchuck Hard Apple Cider, which is THE one to buy.  I learned today that serious bread bakers use gram weight measures instead of liquid measures.  In case that puts anyone else off this recipe, 90 g water is 3/8 cup (shy of 100 ml); 15 g hard alcoholic cider is 150 ml; 10 g salt is shy of 2 teaspoons; and 130 g sourdough starter is between 1/2-2/3 cup).  If you haven&#039;t already, go ahead and get a good digital scale that can do grams or ounces.  Apparently I need a dough whisk; I used my gloved hands to mix.  In fact, I did without the stand mixer and used my gloved hands again; apparently the job is quicker in the stand mixer.  I&#039;m not sure I provided a warm enough environment for the rising.

We made several different sizes from 1&quot; to 2&quot; and found we needed different baking times based on size and thickness - 6 minutes for the smaller/thinner ones, and 7 minutes for the bigger/thicker ones. Time cooling also seemed to affect whether or not they held together...we had some angel wings and heads break off trying to get them off the pan :(  Overall, this was a simple and flavorful recipe - we used powdered sugar to roll out, and the dough was the perfect consistency. We did chill it for about 15 minutes before rolliing them out, but after that we used the dough at room temperature with no problems. Will definitely make these again.",5

I used regular clover honey, but will use orange-blossom honey next time.  I whipped this in my stand mixer.

If only you had included quantities of the filling ingredients!  That was the only thing between 3 stars and 5 stars!  Apparently much of the almond soymilk/milk evaporated during scalding, so I added 2-3 tablespoons of almond soy milk before the first rise (otherwise the dough wouldn&#039;t grab all the flour). For the filling I consulted some other cinnamon roll recipes and used: 1/3 cup butter, melted; 1 cup (dark) brown sugar, packed; 2 1/2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon; and about 1/2 tablespoon flour.  I apparently didn&#039;t use as much cinnamon sugar as you normally do, as I had some left over.  After basting the rolled out dough with melted butter, I sprinkled a little flour before layering on cinnamon sugar, then after the cinnamon sugar, I sprinkled a little flour as well.  For my 2nd set, I tried to add a lot of raisins to the roll, but many fell out while I rolled.  Note: of my 1/3 cup melted butter, there was enough left over to add to the icing.

The cooking is best over a heat source at the table. This recipe includes most of the necessary ingredients, in my opinion. Except green onions. Please include some thick green onions cut on the slant. Tofu would also be a nice addition. I didn&#039;t bother cutting a cross in the mushroom caps, which makes them look nice, but doesn&#039;t affect the flavor. I just cut then in half. I used Chinese cabbage, without cooking it beforehand. I also used a relative of spinach, called komatsuna, which doesn&#039;t need to be cooked previously. The spinach eaten in Japan, called horenso, is generally cooked separately, rinsed in cool water, and then added to dishes, because it contains a substance that can be removed by this process. Komatsuna doesn&#039;t contain this substance, so doesn&#039;t need to be cooked earlier than the other food. The harusame needs preparation, too. I followed the instructions on the bag and boiled it briefly. I also had to figure out how to cut it into managable lengths. I did think there might be a bit too much soy sauce in the soup for me, so decreased it a little. And I did buy the shrimp, but forgot them in the freezer! This makes a lovely, traditionally Japaese meal. There are no directions as to how to make the ponzu joyu sauce. I heated everything briefly, though it is not really necessary.

However, it is a solid, though not hard or tough, block of candy this morning, and cuts cleanly into pieces. I did come to the conclusion that this would be best to make with a friend. I whipped the egg white (brought to room temperature), before starting to cook the sugar mixture because I didn&#039;t think I would have enough time afterward. I think that was a good idea. I was using a hand mixer, and was alone, so tended to add the cooked sugar mixture in glops, rather than in a stream as specified. After each glop, I beat the sugar in. Somehow, this seems to have worked. I have lovely white candy with a beautiful texture. I did double the walnuts, and toast them lightly before starting.

But then, all croquettes are, and if you don&#039;t want to take the trouble, you should make something else. So, the missing star is not because of the difficulty making these. I actually made these croquettes twice, in order to find out if the problem I ran into (insides leaking) was caused by me, or the recipe. The second time, I added 1 tablespoon flour to the amount called for, mixing it into the shrimp, which I cooked at home. The mixture was much firmer and easier to handle the second time. I think I was lazy letting it cool the first time, and water condensed in the fridge, making it too loose. Although it was much better the second time, there was still a small amount of leakage. I think this could be easily solved by adding an egg yolk to the shrimp/white sauce mixture, and then cooling, breading and frying it. A number of croquette recipes I have looked at since, do use an egg yolk or a whole egg in the filling. I made my croquettes larger than the recipe poster, so got fewer. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. I will be making it again, with the addition mentioned.

In Step 2, I put the lemon juice (from 1 Meyer lemon for half a recipe) in a bowl.  It was never mentioned again.   I realized the problem when I heated up the dissolved gelatin (in the U.S., gelatin sheets are not readily available, but when the directions asked that I soak the gelatin in cold water, I used 1/4 cup cold water for 1/4 oz. Knox unflavored gelatin powder [1 envelope] for half a recipe) in the microwave for 30 seconds for Step 4.  Realizing my dilemma, I added the gelatin mixture to the lemon juice and then added that to the double boiler egg yolk-zest-confectioners sugar mixture, which I removed from the heat and began whisking.  In Step 5, I opted to beat the egg whites first with clean beaters and then the cream.  The &quot;3/4 stiff&quot; didn&#039;t translate well for me, so I went for soft peaks.

After reading prior reviews, I doubled the garlic and red pepper flakes, added some Mrs Dash Garlic &amp; Herbs and Mrs Dash Extra Spicy, and tossed in about 2 Tbsp. dehydrated onion flakes to try to thicken the sauce and a parmesan cheese rind.  I also added a bay leaf. This still resulted in a rather bland sauce, and it was too thin for my purpose.  I disagree that this becomes a pizza sauce merely by adding more spices; the water in Step 6 should be omitted.  I ended up adding 2 tsp. sugar and reducing the sauce for 20 minutes to arrive at a thick pizza sauce, and yielded 2 1/2 cups sauce.  I will work on a p.c. sauce more to my liking as I like how the p.c. keeps the flavor in.",3

This recipe made me think!  This recipe is all about the SAUSAGE, so make sure you have mighty fine sausage.  Chicago is the meat-packing capital of the world, so there you can probably find wonderful sausage almost anywhere.  I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian, which is about the best sausage we get in the greater Baltimore area, UNLESS YOU MAKE THE SAUSAGE YOURSELF.  This recipe almost requires that you make your own sausage.  In the past year, I have been disappointed with most commercial sausage I have tried -- too much gristle! Not enough flavor!  I found myself dreaming of Wild Boar sausage from DH&#039;s past hunting expeditions. The pie crust is not as odd as one might think. Chicago pizza dough DOES NOT CONTAIN CORNMEAL and it does rely heavily on CORN OIL; it is usually THICK, almost like a biscuit base, but tasting more like pastry pie crust in its flakiness. The thin pie crust allowed me to add all of the ingredients for this recipe, but my pie didn&#039;t firm up for a decent slice until 30 minutes after I removed it from the oven.  I believe that a thicker crust would have sped up that process.  As for pizza sauce, I made my own using Recipe #413005 reduced to pizza sauce thickness and jazzed up as I saw fit.  It worked fine.  Back to the NY pizza bias: normally I would ask for &quot;extra sauce&quot;, but in this recipe, that would be ridiculous!  In the end, I applaud your effort, you made me think outside my box.  Next project: authentic Chicago pizza dough!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag.",4

I went with the two cups wholewheat flour, rather than try any other. I was using instant yeast, which is mixed into the flour, with the liquid then added, so I tried to calculate the total liquid needed, orange juice plus warm water, because I was using dry milk powder. Anyway, I totally missed the 1/4 cup water to dissolve the yeast, so my dough was 1/4 cup water short. Because I often make bread, I knew better than add the entire amount of flour at the end, and stopped when the dough was ready. Because of this, the bread is delicious. Next time I will read the recipe more carefully. I didn&#039;t change anything else, except add 1/4 teaspoon orange oil. I don&#039;t know what is responsible, but the bread does make nice orangey tasting toast.

Part of the trouble was that though I&#039;m used to baking bread, I tend to approach it from the point of using a fixed amount of liquid to a variable amount of flour. Here the flour is all mixed up first, then the liquid is added. I was afraid to add too much more liquid, so I got overly dense bread that didn&#039;t rise (only one loaf, I froze the rest of the dough for reworking later). I suppose if I had increased the liquid considerably, it would have worked, but I didn&#039;t want to stray too far from the recipe. This time, I rearranged the recipe to be easy for me, with liquid, yeast, sugar, other ingredients, then part of the flour. I think my cornmeal and brown rice were dry, and needed more water. This time, because I added the liquid first, I ended up using only 5 1/3 cups of white flour. I didn&#039;t glaze the loaves or bother with seeds. I got 2 loaves of 700 grams each and one small loaf of 315 grams. But what beautiful bread this is - soft and tender. I&#039;m very happy with it and will use this recipe again.

I used 3 large Costco chicken breasts and about half the veggies with McCormick&#039;s Montreal seasoning.  I didn&#039;t have mushrooms or parsley so left them out. I used frozen haricot vert and microwaved them a couple of minutes because of the comments but wished I hadn&#039;t as they were a bit over done. I didn&#039;t cut the dressing part in half but should have as I used most of it and even though it didn&#039;t look like much going on with all the fat from the chicken, all the veggies were very moist and there was a extra fat in the pan afterwards. I cooked this at 375 by accident, for about an hour and 15 minutes. Everything was well done all the flavors were yummily melded and some of the veggies a little caramelized. I used individual garlic cloves still in their skins with their tops cut off- they were scrumptious. We loved the crunch of the panko with out having the work or carbs of a full breading. It&#039;s great having recipes where you make it, stick it in the oven and have a whole meal come out and all you have to do is pour the wine!

First, although candy is often enjoyed by children, any type of candy making involving the heating of sugar or sugar solutions, should never be attempted by children, and should, if fact, be undertaken when children aren&#039;t around. Hot sugar reaches very high temperatures, and sticks, producing terrible burns. Adults, also, need to exercise extreme caution when cooking sugar. Another important thing is to use a large pan - much larger than seems necessary, because the heated mixture is likely to boil up. Lastly, stay next to the stove when making candy, and watch the pan so that you can prevent accidents. With all this in mind, candy making can be a rewarding experience. I added some orange oil and orange essence, also some food color, to this recipe&#039;s mixture. I forgot the vanilla this time. I&#039;m not sure if I would rather use it, or not. BTW, it might be a good idea to remove the &quot;divided&quot; from the water in the ingredient list. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.",5

Since my daughter&#039;s BF is from South Africa and living full time in the USA he had been trying to replicate rusks from his childhood memory. So when I was looking through Zurie&#039;s recipes I was happy to see that she had a rusk recipe posted. I devided the recipe in half. I also had to create my own self rising flour which I found a recipe for on this site. I made a mistake and added too much buttermilk to the dough so I could not form the dough into balls. So instead of adding more flour, I decided to run with it and pour it into a baking dish. I cooked it for an hour and it smelled heavenly. I then popped it out while it was still warm and it slid out perfectly. I reduced the the temp on the oven and sliced the bread cake in half and then in slices again. We tasted it and it was delicious. I then proceeded in using half of the in this state. The other half I baked in the oven at the 170 degrees for the time suggested with the door propped open like suggested. The rusks came out similar as biscottis but not as dense. They are quite tasty. I actually like them better in the intermediate state which I love plain, whereas DH and MIL both tried them with butter. In the hard state they are good with tea or coffee.

The instructions are easy to follow, and the only thing I did differently (well not differently) was to add probably another 1/3 to 1/2 cup flour as I kneaded. The dough was super sticky at first, and I&#039;m not sure why. The bread is delicious, totally delicious. So far we&#039;ve had it for dinner, breakfast and a snack. Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe that I will use often. It really has shown me how easy sourdough baking can be. UPDATE: I&#039;m making this recipe often and it turns out beautifully every time. Thought I would mention two changes I have to make. I still need to add another 1/2 cup of flour or so, which must say something about Australian versus American flour. Also, I need to spray a bit of oil on the parchment before baking or the bread sticks to it like glue. This really is a fabulous and simple bread. Hubby delayed lunch today by an hour to wait for it to come out of the oven. Later I came home from grocery shopping to find half a loaf gone! No wonder I have to make it often.

Step 1: the chicken came out moist and delicious. but my favorite way to cook chicken and get some chicken broth is Recipe #369106.   Step 2: the most daring part for me: I had 2 jalapeno peppers (couldn&#039;t get serrano peppers) and that took the sauce to &quot;2-Alarms&quot;, the maximum amount of heat DH and I can tolerate.  For the tomatoes, I used the whole tomatoes from 2 28-oz. cans of whole San Marzano tomatoes, reserving the tomato juice for some miscellaneous liquid requirement.  The sauce tasted &quot;finished&quot;, not canned, yippee!  Step 3: here is where I wish I had 3 cups chicken broth from Recipe#369106 for fuller flavor (although there is so much flavor in the sauce as written).  I found that 1 hr. 30 minutes of simmering was needed to develop a thick sauce, and I would do the same next time.  Step 4: Couldn&#039;t find Mexican crema, but Chowhound folks insist that cr&egrave;me fraiche is very similar; I was very happy that I used cr&egrave;me fraiche instead of ubiquitous grocery store sour cream.

My 19-mo.-old granddaughter used the word, &quot;meat&quot;, for the first time and followed me around to cut up some of the very tender pork meat for her.  The recipe didn&#039;t specify, so I made 2 layers of ribs in a buffet half-tray; after each 15 minutes I removed each of the layers to its own holding plate, and put the former top layer on the bottom turned over, then likewise for the former bottom layer.  The ribs were not done within 50 minutes, which presented a safety concern as it&#039;s hard to use an instant read thermometer on these ribs; we gave them another 30 minutes, but concluded that the ribs should be cooked in a single layer if using the oven so they could be quickly flipped.  Ribs made this way weren&#039;t &quot;pretty&quot; -- we thought they needed reduced fresh marinade to add some gloss and sticky wonderfulness.

I did get about 13 dozen for the half batch, so the yield is quite accurate, too. These don&#039;t spread very much, so it is possible to place the pieces of dough relatively close to each other. I shaped the dough into rolls about the diameter of a nickle, cut them, then briefly rounded them off with my hands. Maybe because I often make bread with sticky dough, this dough didn&#039;t seem all that sticky to me. And I think I got the measurements correct, but these didn&#039;t seem so very spicy to me.

I think that muffin pans might be easier to work with (at least in my case, with an oven too small for the pan called for.)

I used my Br&oslash;d &amp; Taylor bread proofing box set at 80 degrees F, which worked like a charm.  I guess I&#039;m too old and out of shape for this recipe as written.  I&#039;m curious whether my ABM could prep the dough for me.  I had so much going on at dinner that I forgot to add one of the toppings, although they look good!

I kept the tenderloin in the oven at 200-degrees F until the end.  Just fantastic, the only downside is the prep time, but it was worth it.

Ready to cook but short a shallot, I decided to use a small onion and matching mass in garlic, added to the food processor for mincing. I used half-and-half, but next time I would use whipping cream to ensure a thick sauce without prolonged heating.  After cooking shrimps and scallops, I removed the already cooked shrimp to a 200F oven before adding the wine.  After adding the cream and seasonings, and accepting the current thickness of the sauce, I added back the shrimp to let them soak up some of the seasoning.  As a result, our scallops and shrimps were all perfectly cooked.  The key accent to the sauce was the tarragon, so next time I will splurge on fresh tarragon.

First, IMO, they need more salt to bring out the flavor of the corn, an additional 1/4 teaspoon or even 1/2 teaspoon would be good, I think. I also feel that there is too much oil in them. I would decrease the oil to 1/3 cup. I think the honey could also be decreased to 1/3 cup with no harm done. Also, modern raisins do not need scalding or soaking, unless you are trying to add a particular flavor, which is not the case here. I made these muffins twice, because the first time I used dry buttermilk powder (mixed with the flour) and water, and got (naturally) a very watery batter, in which the raisins (which I had scalded) sunk like stones. I did get reasonable muffins, though the raisins were all on the bottom, but didn&#039;t think writing a review from that experience would be fair. So, I tried again, this time with plain yogurt, buttermilk being unavailable here. This time, I got a fairly thick batter, which held up the raisins, and my only problems are the points mentioned above. Thank you for posting this recipe.",4

77348,fish soup with saffron,6,14,40,375.9,5.0,22.0,15.0,56.0,3.0,15.0,86318,2014-02-19,"This is so good, I&#039;m quite astounded. It&#039;s lovely, too. There were a few problems - the main one concerns the saffron. I love saffron, but have seen first hand what happens when it is overused. I was shocked to find out that my small jar of saffron, contained only 1/2 gram saffron, which is the amount the ingredients list for this soup, which serves four. Thinking it must be some mistake, I took out about a scant 1/4 teaspoon, and used that, first using only half. The truth is that I can&#039;t taste the saffron, but, frankly, I don&#039;t care. I can taste the vegetables, the fish, the stock, and the basil and dill. That seems plenty, to me. I may even make this without any saffron next time, to see how it&#039;s different. It&#039;s not that I grudge using a whole jar of saffron, I just have a horror of soup that tastes only of saffron. Anyway. I also read somewhere that saffron should be steeped in hot water about 20 minutes before using. I guess cooking it in stock would be the same, but am not sure. One more thing and I&#039;ll finish this wordy review: this recipe goes together like lightening. Like a Chinese stirfry. Do all the preparation beforehand or you will get behind. Thank you very much for letting me eat this delicious soup.Update: I steeped about 1/4 gram saffron in boiling water and added it one portion of the soup which was leftover from yesterday. Admittedly, my saffron may not be the freshest, but it seemed fine in the soup. This leads me to believe that 1/2 gram saffron would be an appropriate amount for the full batch.",5

I used all of the ingredients listed (with the exception of the garnish - I was planning to use coriander leaves as a garnish, but didn&#039;t get around to it.)

However, I was interested in trying a different curry, and I&#039;m glad I did. I had very tough stew meat, and had to add water to the mixture to prevent burning during the long cooking. I needed to cook it for about 3 1/2 hours. It is, now, tender and nice to eat. I would, perhaps, pre-cook the meat if I make this curry with such tough meat again. I am looking forward to making it again, with somewhat more tender meat. Also, I would like to add that this review is based on eating the dish the recipe made, and has no relation to the authenticity of this kind of curry in Thai cooking.

When I made nochlo&#039;s excellent Recipe#508578 #508578, I simulated Provel cheese with Recipe#382006 #382006, and it had a decidedly cheddar taste.  This time I elected to combine Sargento&#039;s Chef Blends 4 Cheese Pizzeria (Shredded Natural Mozzarella, Cheddar, Smoked Provolone and Non-Smoked Sharp Provolone) with Sargento&#039;s Artisan Blends Swiss (Shredded Natural Swiss &amp; Grand Cru Cheese), with muted cheddar cheese taste, but complex enough to tantalize.  This pizza is heavy with pepperoni and sausage but a relatively light cheese topping.  This was a delicious change of pace for us.  The only flat bread I could find at my local market was a cracker, and I made an okay pizza with that as long as I did not try to toast the cracker first; I think nochlo meant something more like naan or pita bread, which would work pretty much like pizza crust.  As a backup, I made a pizza on a Boboli crust, toasting it a few minutes as nochlo instructed, and that pizza was excellent!  In short, you&#039;ll love this pizza if you love pepperoni and Italian sausage and don&#039;t use a cracker as a base. As for the cheese, if your family prefers cheddar to mozzarella, go with Recipe#382006 #382006; if you want muted cheddar, you might try the blend I described.  Made for Please Review My Recipe.",5

111637,tsr version of kraft shake n bake  original  by todd wilbur,16,7,40,21.3,0.0,2.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,724631,2014-03-06,"Nice and crunchy, had just enough coating for 4 large bone-in skin-on chicken thighs.  Growing up, whenever we had chicken it was Shake &#039;n Bake, so I vowed never to buy a box of overpriced spices and crumbs.  With this recipe I kept my vow but also enjoyed this great weeknight.  I used Kellogg&#039;s cornflake crumbs so I could be sure how fine or coarse the crumb should be (1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. is 2.5 oz. or 70 g, in case I plan to pulverize corn flakes myself).  For my first time, I dipped the chicken in water, then pressed the chicken against the crumb mixture in a plastic bag to apply as much coating as possible.  After over 45 years, I cannot say whether this tasted just like Shake &#039;n Bake, although I suspect it would taste closer had I dipped the chicken in vegetable oil instead of water.  We eat a LOT of chicken, so I am happy to add this to my bag of tricks.  Served with Recipe#503019 and steamed broccoli. Made for Name That Ingredient Tag, QI = all-purpose flour.",5

I used plain, European style yogurt, and added 1 teaspoon vinegar, based on a conversion chart I have. It seemed to work fine, though I have in the past used yogurt with no vinegar, and had no trouble, either. I didn&#039;t make any other substitutions, however I did add 1/4 teaspoon salt, and am now wishing I had added 1/2 teaspoon salt instead. I was surprised to see that there is no salt in this recipe. I do understand that some people need to cut out salt for their health, but do not think it is necessary in recipes for general use. Anyway, other than being insufficiently salted, these seem to be fine. Next time I think I will use darker brown sugar than I did today, and maybe increase the cinnamon a little, too. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. Update: I had put half of the muffins in the freezer for longer storage. I tried some of them today and was very happy to find them much more to my liking. I will change the rating to 5 stars. I think that this is like quick breads, which are much better the following day. I think traditional muffins are best as soon as they come out of the oven, but this recipe is more like a quick bread, and benefits from the wait. I will make them again, but take the necessary time for the muffins to mellow, into consideration.",5

I&#039;ve been baking sourdough bread a lot lately, but agree with another reviewer&#039;s comment that a bit more detail in the instructions would be especially helpful for novice (or even seasoned) bakers. For example, knead well could mean 6, 8 or 10 minutes. I went with 8. And I struggled a bit to figure out how to get it right for 11 rolls for the 9x13 pan. Golfball is too small and fist is too big.

I used a good handful of dill instead of the rosemary, and had only dried thyme, which I mixed in with the milk and cheese in the morning. I forgot to buy cherry tomatoes, but had some very nice plum tomatoes which I diced. I may have used a bit more spinach, cooked it and drained in a colander, squeezed and then cut up with scissors right in the colander. I left it there to drain further, and then squeezed out more liquid before adding to the pasta and cheese sauce.

We decided this was a NY-style cheesecake.  It seems that no matter how good a springform pan claims to be, leakage occurs; I used redundant safeguards: 1) I lined the inside of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent the batter from leaking; 2) I then placed a parchment paper circle on the inside bottom, and lined the interior sides with parchment paper to make it easy to unveil the cheesecake; and 3) I laid another large piece of aluminum foil under the pan and pressed it up the sides to prevent the water bath from seeping into the pan.  To make it easier to remove the cheesecake pan from the pressure cooker after cooking, I made 2 long 4-ply aluminum straps and crossed them at a 90&deg; angle on top of the trivet, then placed the filled pan on top and fastened the ends of the straps above the pan.  I had a good laugh at myself, but I experienced no leaks, so it was worth it!  I&#039;m not sure about chocolate wafers with a lemon cheesecake, so I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs. By the way, I used a 7&quot;-diamerter, 3&quot; tall Kaiser Noblesse springform pan, which fit easily into my oval 6-quart electric pressure cooker. My cheesecake cooked up perfectly, with no pool of water in the middle.  I made this after dinner so it could chill overnight for the next day&#039;s dinner.

It was fine for me. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.",5

We each had 2 waffles (the mix made 9) and were full, thanks to the whole grains.  (BTW, I used rye flour I had ground myself because I make so much rye bread.)  An idea to try next time is to separate the eggs, and fold in whipped whites with the baking powder and baking soda; that should make the waffles even lighter.

Although the 1 tablespoon of pepper fit in, the accompanying tablespoon of salt should be eliminated due to the 1 1/2 pounds of cheese.  The b&eacute;chamel sauce was supposed to take about 10 minutes, but it took me 45 minutes after I raised the heat to medium, then medium-high.  The mac &#039;n cheese needs to rest at least 5 minutes before serving to hold its shape.  This is the first time I used panko on mac &#039;n cheese, and it seemed too blond for an already very light macaroni and cheese, and made me question why I would want to eat so many crumbs. Lastly, unless the entire tray will be consumed at one meal, I think dried parsley would be a better garnish at the very end.

I did change it around quite a lot, so will not assign stars. A few things I noticed: I used dry skim milk for the filling, and nearly (but not actually, thank goodness) burned it. I didn&#039;t have a thermometer, the battery in my last one having died, and was stirring occasionally, which evidently wasn&#039;t enough. So watch out when heating the milk. My cottage cheese turned out quite firm. I added about 1/2 cup cream I had on hand, but it still is definitely different from store bought cottage cheese. And, frankly, I&#039;m not so sure of the flavor. I&#039;m thinking of trying making cottage cheese with a quart of whole milk and 2 tablespoons vinegar, to see how it differs. The yield from 1 gallon milk was also only 3 cups. I used half semolina and half bread flour in the pasta. The mixture was extremely dry, and I added another egg, and some flour to make up for it, rather than keep spraying the dough with water. That seemed to be the right decision, especially since I think the eggs I used were a little small. The pasta dough made with semolina is a joy to work with, being completely nonsticky. BTW, my research tells me that 00 flour is very finely milled, but the protein (which makes the gluten) content, is often fairly high. The gluten acts differently than in bread dough, however. This recipe has a lot of information that is useful for a person starting out as a ravioli chef. Thank you very much for sharing it.",0

I can only think of 2 things that might have made a difference. I used real grated Parmesan cheese. I imagine if I used the powdered stuff that comes in a can, it wouldn&#039;t have been as heavy. Since none of the reviewers mention which kind of Parmesan cheese they used, I&#039;m not sure if this was the problem or not. The only other thing I can think of is my bread machine has 3 rises in a cycle. My old one only had 2. I know that bread doesn&#039;t rise as much each time it is punched down. Maybe this is why my loaf was rather dense and only about half as high as the one on the photo. However, it was excellent tasting bread. The texture was closer to a biscuit/scone or batter bread.

If you don&#039;t have fresh artichokes you can also use frozen or canned ones!&lt;br/&gt;Though slow simmering of the ingredients the sauce should thicken, but this depends on the quality of the potatoes as well. As Katel said on option is to add some flour to the sauce (mixed with some liquid) just before serving. Depending on the quantity of water added it&#039;s possible that you have to add some water (small quantities) from time to time and never let dry the pan at the end the potatoes should be soft but not mushy.&lt;br/&gt;I used less oil,I confess it, but in Greece where there is a lot of high quality olive oil, this quantity is not unusual and the sauce of this dish is delicous with some bread! You will not need meat or something more.&lt;br/&gt;For my taste it&#039;s not necessary to discard the dill used for cooking, but it&#039;s true that it looks nicer if you top the dish with fresh dill and serve it with lemon slices.&lt;br/&gt;I hope next time I will have fresh artichokes on hand!",5

Some I overcooked and they were still nice and chewy, but the bottoms burned.  My husband asked for BIG cookies, so I made a few really large size.

I had a 26cm Kaiser springform pan with glass bottom; per Cooks Illustrated, the Kaiser pan promotes over-browning, which I experienced.  I usually make (successfully) smaller cheesecakes in a pressure cooker, but I was successful when I used this same 26cm pan to make Recipe #244193 in the oven.  As for the taste: the cheesecake tasted okay to me; DH said he would be delighted to eat the rest of the cheesecake and was ready to give 5 stars.  The sauce can cover any cracks in the cheesecake, but there was a bit too much lemon in it to suit me (and I love lemon!).  Because it is off-season, my strawberries weren&#039;t great, even though I trimmed them down to only the juicy red parts.  On the plus side, I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and that was perfect.

I had to micro my taters for about 6 1/2 minutes--I didn&#039;t run them underwater (thought that would remove 2 much starch)--but I let them cool a bit, cut them into quarters &amp; then cut them into smaller pieces. I thought about leaving the peel on, but it came off rather easily. I added 2 slices chopped turkey bacon, 1 chopped hard boiled egg--I had no yogurt, so I used fat free mayo &amp; regular mustard (had no other kinds!). I chilled it for about an hour, too. I also used the green olives &amp; diced pickles--added a nice salty touch. Thanks again for this recipe; was a life saver!!!",5

The dough for the cookie portion seemed really dry in comparison to any other whoopie pie recipe I&#039;ve made, and they didn&#039;t come out that deep chocolate brown either. They didn&#039;t spread very much, and the texture was more like a an actual cookie than soft and cakey. Since I&#039;m a big frosting and filling lover, I doubled the filling recipe (most whoopie pie filling recipes I&#039;ve made in the past need to be doubled to have enough filling).  Because the cookie part didn&#039;t spread out flat and stayed kind of small, I would have been just fine with a single batch of the filling -- I was only able to use about half of my filling up (and that was filling them pretty generously, too). I put the leftover filling in the fridge for some other use, but I think I will have to doctor it a bit to minimize the dominant flavor of shortening in it. I did find that these tasted better the next day. The cookie part softened up a bit more, and the flavors melded so the shortening in the filling wasn&#039;t so prominent. Don&#039;t get me wrong, they weren&#039;t awful, but they just weren&#039;t what I was expecting from a whoopie pie recipe. I&#039;m really sorry, I wanted to love these, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;d make these again without some alterations to the recipe. Thanks for posting, though! Made for PAC Spring 2014",3

In fact, I told him he could take them to work to share with his guys, and he said no, he wanted to keep these at home because the guys would eat all of them on him. I suspect that my batch wasn&#039;t even as spicy as they are supposed to be, because I didn&#039;t have any Tony Chachere&#039;s seasoning (I subbed in Lawry&#039;s Seasoning Salt instead). Didn&#039;t make them any less addictive, though! The recipe doesn&#039;t give any amount for the clarified butter, so I just referenced another similar recipe on the site.  I ended up using 1/2 cup of ghee with the 1/2 cup of oil, which worked perfectly.

I really liked the flavor that the cream cheese brought to the filling -- sometimes I find that pasta filled with pure ricotta cheese is just too, well, ricotta-y, but the cream cheese made this perfect. I didn&#039;t have any Paul Newman sauce, so I subbed in one jar of Barilla Traditional sauce and one big jar of Victoria marinara sauce. I think I ended up using more sauce than was required because the Victoria sauce was a Costco-sized jar, but it thickened up quite a bit in the oven, and we like pasta heavy on the sauce anyhow. I was initially worried that the pasta wouldn&#039;t soften enough if it wasn&#039;t pre-cooked, but it was just right after it&#039;s time in the oven (soft but not soggy). I could fit all but 4 of the manicotti in one big pan, so I put the last of the manicotti in a small (1.5 quart) Corningware dish. I was hoping to keep the smaller dish for photo purposes and leave the large casserole pan for DH to take his dinner from, but when I got home from work, I realized that DH had used the smaller dish as his dinner plate, lol.

This makes great use of the (absurdly expensive) Spanish chorizo, but it was worth it!  Our nearby markets had no fresh shiitake mushrooms, so I used 1 1/2 oz. dried shiitake mushrooms (subbing for 1/2 pound fresh).  (I boiled the dried shiitake mushrooms 11 minutes and let them cool and drain thoroughly; I would do this as the very first step, even before the potatoes.)

I have seen that given as an acceptable substitute, but it is a substitute, and may have made the cake batter a little looser. I say this because the cupcakes sort of drooped off to one side, rather than rising into a nicely shaped dome. The fan on my oven may have had something to do with this, too, but I don&#039;t have the problem when I make muffins. The flavor of the cake is reasonable, in my opinion, but not very rich. I think an icing would make it nicer. The recipe itself, is simple, but could perhaps include a few more details, such as to what consistency the liquid should be beaten, or what size pans would be appropriate.

Perhaps it would be easier to understand if this were changed to &quot;small loaf pans.&quot; I actually used one quite large, but narrow, loaf pan, piling the meat up in the center. It took about 1 hour and 40 minutes to cook through. I added salt and some pepper and put red pepper on the bottom of the pan. I can understand that making a batch this size could be convenient, but do recommend that people trying first, halve this recipe or even make only one third. I needed to grind the meat (I was using frozen meat that I chopped up) in the food processor in batches, and did find the finished amount rather unwieldy.

I didn&#039;t even need to get out my mixer. I used oil only, no applesauce. Maybe it&#039;s moister with applesauce? Knowing that this kind of cake is often better the following day, I waited until the next day to cut it. I used the optional nuts and raisins, but only dusted the top with a little confectioners&#039; sugar, rather than make the icing. The icing might have made it a tiny bit moister.

UPDATE: I have managed to cure this cake&#039;s dryness by spritzing it with liquid. I put the cake into a plastic food container and sprayed it thoroughly with peach liqueur, that I had put into a spray bottle. I then waited for the cake to soak up the moisture, and was rewarded with a reasonably moist, very flavorful cake. I had been afraid I would have to throw it away, so was quite happy with the result.

The only reason I couldn&#039;t give this 5 stars is that the bacon didn&#039;t completely cook, so diners had to separate the uncooked bacon to return to the oven for thorough baking before frozen for another use.  The bacon did ensure constant basting of the meat, which was its primary purpose.  I prebaked the bacon for 10 minutes at 350F; perhaps if more direction on the bacon&#039;s partial cooking had been given, the bacon might have still served its basting purpose but come out completely edible.  Because I wanted to grill, it rained, so I baked this at 350F until my instant read thermometer read 128F, and then let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.

My Kuhn Rikon has specific directions for rices and grains - NEVER cook at 15 psi, only at 10 psi so there will be little chance of clogging the vent and more leeway in the precise cooking time!  I opted to soak my brown rice for 2 hours and then let it drain for an hour prior to cooking, so following K-R&#039;s directions, 1) I used 3 cups water for 2 cups rice, 2) brought everything but the rice to boiling over high heat, then stirred in the rice for a minute before securing the lid, 3) quickly brought my 5L pressure braiser to its &quot;low&quot; pressure setting (10 psi), then moved to a double-grated burner to sustain the pressure at 10 psi on Simmer without fiddling for 12 minutes, and 4) allowed pressure to reduce naturally.  My rice came out the perfect texture.  It had a delicate flavor, so it could be used as a base for other rice recipes as well. I used 4 tsp. Better Than Bouillon instead of bouillon cubes.

I&#039;ll eat meat-based burgers, but definitely as a fairly infrequent guilty pleasure. I&#039;ve always liked veggie burgers, because then it&#039;s the burger experience minus the guilt, and I just enjoy the taste of them. I think these veggie burgers are in my top three faves (in the company of Dr. Praeger&#039;s California Veggie burgers and Cheesecake Factory&#039;s version). I used short-grain brown rice in this (the ingredient list says jasmine rice, but the instructions say brown rice). The seasonings might seem like a lot when they&#039;re being added, but I thought they were perfect in the finished product. These do have a little bit of a spice kick from the chili powder, but not too bad (much less so than your average bowl of chili). I found the mixture to be a litte too squishy once fully assembled, so I added in approximately 1/2 cup additional breadcrumbs to give these more body. I did add one can of corn kernels, drained and patted dry -- the more, the merrier when it comes to veggies! I didn&#039;t measure the mixture while I was forming the patties, just kind of eyeballed them, but I ended up with 12 good-sized thick patties. I cooked them on the stovetop using my ridged grill pan, which I misted with olive oil before frying. Even with the extra breadcrumbs, the burgers were still pretty delicate when raw. I had the best luck when I added the patties to the hot pan, then left them alone for about 6 or 7 minutes before flipping them. They&#039;re still far softer than meat-based burgers once cooked, but I suppose that us veggie burger eaters are used to that. Because of the mashed black beans in these, the fully cooked burgers might appear a bit charred, but no worries  -- they don&#039;t taste burnt. DH is kind of a chicken about new and different foods, so I&#039;m not sure that I will get him to try these, but I think I might wrap these up and put them in the freezer so can take them out and bring them to work for dinner as needed. I actually enjoyed one for dinner tonight, done up with  Pepperidge Farm sliced bread, ketchup, pickles, sliced tomato, lettuce and Havarti cheese. Very happy with these, thanks for posting!

I felt like this was a much faster version of mole than other&#039;s I&#039;ve tried, which is nice. I didn&#039;t have any raisins, so I subbed in the next closest thing I had: fresh dates. I think this made it a bit sweeter than it would&#039;ve been with the raisins, but I thought they worked fine here. It was just spicy enough that DH actually didn&#039;t complain that it was too sweet for him (his family typically makes black mole, which is much stronger and not sweet at all, AND not that appealing  if you ask me, lol). I also opted to use the cocoa powder instead of the bittersweet chocolate. I poached some skinless boneless chicken thighs in broth for the meat, and I served this with some sliced avocado on top and warm comal-toasted corn tortillas on the side. I do recommend keeping a bit of additional warm chicken broth/stock on hand to thin this out if desired -- it thickened up quite a bit in the end.

These were a great use for it! Tender, tasty little muffins! Based on the previous review, I reduced the oven temp to 375F -- I think this did the trick, since the bottoms of my muffins were nicely golden brown after 20 minutes, not at all burned. I used a medium cookie scoop to portion these out, rather than the larger muffin scoop that I normally would&#039;ve used. With heaping medium-size scoops, I ended up with exactly 24 muffins. They&#039;re small (well, normal size, as opposed to the crazy ginormous bakery muffins out there), but that&#039;s probably a good thing -- that means that they are truly a single serving each. Just for fun, I sprinkled the tops of these with some rainbow sparkle sugar before baking. Although these were really good with just the pineapple, I bet these would be really good with some maraschino cherry, coconut, or maybe some other tropical fruit as well (mango, perhaps?). I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be making these again, since I ALWAYS buy too much ricotta cheese whenever I make lasagna or stuffed pasta. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014",5

I realize that Texas chili uses no beans at all, but we plan to add an additional can of black beans next time.

The fish tasted good and normal (an opportunity here to &quot;blacken&quot;).  Several times the recipe called for salt and pepper; the recipe could be improved to give quantities, as I wondered what I would end up with.  For the flour mix, the amount of flour could be reduced to 1/2 cup and still have enough for easy coverage; in Step 5 specific amounts were given but these were not listed among the ingredients (I like to line up my ingredients in order of use like a countdown).  It would be helpful if Step 7 gave some estimated cooking times.  I was very impressed with the avocado sauce that didn&#039;t blacken while standing and that allowed me to cover a good bit of the tortilla.  The coleslaw mix began to get soggy; the carrots would have stayed crisper had I used my old-fashioned grater rather than the new Microplane grater which grates too finely for this purpose.  For half a recipe&#039;s worth of coleslaw mix, I used 4 drops of Crystal hot sauce, and wished I had used a drop more for a bit more tang.

When warm, they are very gooey and a tad greasy from all the butter, but they cool down into something more like a traditional blondie in texture with a slightly crisp outer crust.  I used 2TBS less butter than the recipe called for (didn&#039;t feel like cutting into a frozen stick of butter for the last 2TBS). Seeing how mine came out when warm, I&#039;m guessing that you could probably cut the butter amount down to 1 stick (1/2 cup) and still get good results in the end. The amount of white chocolate chips seem like overkill when mixing them in, but it&#039;s perfect once baked. I wasn&#039;t sure I was even going to get to try these, since Strawberry Nesquik is pretty scarce in my area for some reason -- I looked for it at 5 different grocery stores before locating it at the sixth!

I&#039;m not sure I would use this to replace the crust with every type of pizza, but I would definitely use it with any veggie or chicken pizza toppings. It&#039;s a pretty delicate crust, so my pizza was definitely not a &quot;pick up a slice and go&quot; affair -- this required utensils. I&#039;m not sure how it will hold up if reheated  because I haven&#039;t tried that yet, but I know that it makes for some fabulous cold leftover pizza.

I couldn&#039;t bring myself to go totally sauceless, so I spread some Recipe#513306 on the base before adding the toppings. I really enjoyed this hot from the oven. The spinach crust is more delicate than a traditional pizza crust, so this was definitely a plate-and-utensils affair. I actually tried the leftover pizza the next day, cold from the fridge, and it was equally good. Chilling makes the spinach crust more sturdy, so the leftovers could be eaten out of hand.

I pierced the roasts all over with a skewer before combining them in a big zip bag with the marinade, and I marinated them for 48 hours (my oven was occupied with carnitas at 24 hours). I think the extra time did it good anyway, since eye round roasts are chubby little cuts of meat. I think the extra time allowed the flavor of the marinade to permeate the meat nearly all the way through. I patted off most of the excess marinade before roasting, because I didn&#039;t want the garlic pieces to burn. What was left dripped off the roasts while cooking, mixing with the meat juices and making some somewhat salty but very tasty pan drippings that I think I might mix with some low sodium beef broth and a bit of water to make an au jus of sorts to go with my sliced beef. I really like Italian roast beef from the deli counter, and this marinade gives a similar effect here. I see some super-yummy roast beef sandwiches in my near future, thanks to this marinade!

Clam juice eluded me, so I subbed Clamato for both the tomato juice and the clam juice.  I used a pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker, reducing cooking time to 25 minutes (including time to reach pressure and for quick release), and more flavor was retained.  Using the pressure cooker, 1) I first browned the proteins for 4 minutes in the oil (beginning with 2 minutes for Aidell&#039;s Andouille Chicken sausage, then adding shrimp for 1 minute, then adding bay scallops for 2 minutes), then removed them to a pasta bowl via a slotted spoon to reserve in a 180F oven; 2) I then followed Step 1 to prepare the vegetables; 3) I followed Step 2&#039;s first sentence, then brought to a boil, secured the lid and brought up to 15 psi (high pressure), cooking for 8 minutes after reaching pressure; 4) I did a quick release of the pressure by depressing the steam vent; 5) because my Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker did not cook off much liquid, I needed to simmer the contents to reduce the liquid to an acceptable thickness (I would decrease the water to 1/2 cup next time).  Because the Clamato was so liquid, the tomato ingredients didn&#039;t burn on the bottom of the pressure cooker.

When they were still warm, I think the peanut butter was the odd flavor out with the amaretto in there, but the flavors melded nicely once the cookies cooled. I had soaked my raisins (golden) and dates in the amaretto for a few days before making the cookies, but I completely forgot to add the water. In hindsight, I don&#039;t think the water is necessary. I&#039;m assuming that with the water, the dough is too loose to retain it&#039;s shape while baking, until the dough is chilled anyway. I found that the freshly-made dough with just the amaretto was fine to be scooped and baked without the chilling period  -- it was a tiny bit softer than my usual drop cookie dough, but not so much that the cookies spread any more than, say, a regular chocolate chip cookie. I baked them for the 18 minutes, and they came out perfectly. I&#039;m not sure exactly how many cookies I will get from this, since I only baked up 1 tray this morning.

I had a block of tamarind pulp, and I cut off about 1 tablespoonful, chopped it coarsely and soaked it in about 3 tablespoons warm water. When I wanted to use it, I mashed it together and took 1 tablespoon fruit puree. (I have never used tamarind before, so do not know if this is the usual way to use it.)

Pretty easy to make, once I found a pot big enough to hold all the popcorn, pretzels and nuts (used one of my tamale pots). I had to make a couple partial subs, due to pantry item availability: I didn&#039;t have enough light brown sugar for 2 cups, so I used 1 cup light and 1 cup dark, and I didn&#039;t have any dark brown corn syrup, so I used whatever light corn syrup I had (just shy of what I required), and topped it off with a heaping spoonful of Lyle&#039;s Golden Syrup to make up the difference. For some unknown reason, I added M&amp;M&#039;s to the first pan, then dumped it all in my pot to mix. That pan ended up very separate, with no clumps to break up, and no M&amp;M&#039;s stuck to anything. The next pan, I sprinkled the M&amp;M&#039;s over the sheet of caramel corn and let it cool untouched. I have to say, not one M&amp;M stuck to anything in that pan either. That pan stayed in a sheet and had to be broken into pieces, but no M&amp;M&#039;s stuck to anything, lol. Not a big deal, it just means that the mixture probably will need to be shaken up a bit to redistribute the candies so they don&#039;t all sink to the bottom of the container. Definitely not a deal-breaker, since the flavor of this is just fabulous! I ended up with two 15.7cup bowlfuls of caramel corn -- great for a potluck/party/holiday gifts. Thanks for posting!

I made a smaller one due to oven limitations, maybe 1 1/4 lb or so of meat, and I improvised the precise list of ingredients for it. I creased the parchment paper to indicate the maximum width (with two straight sides made like this, it&#039;s easy to square off the other two), but should make it narrower next time. My rectangle ended up closer to square, and so I did not quite get enough of a roll to the loaf, if that makes sense, so that it did not seal enough. I used the chard, several cheeses and some fresh and rehydrated mixed mushrooms. The bacon did not finish cooking in the time I needed for the roll to cook through - about 45 minutes - so I fried them off in the pan. I would probably omit the bacon next time, as I prefer a crustier exterior. Also, the chard was still rather &quot;firm&quot; and a bit hard to cut through - I had very big leaves, perhaps more mature. I&#039;d cut them into smaller pieces next time.

Through some trial and error, I found that the cakes were less likely to fall apart when flipping them if they were cooked for longer than 4 minutes on the first side. I also recommend using a spatula with a very thin edge to it to properly lift the crust off the pan (they stuck a tiny bit). They are equally tasty warm and at room temp, which is nice, because then you don&#039;t have to worry about keeping the first batch hot while you fry the next batch.

Avocado oil doesn&#039;t have a strong &quot;avocado&quot; taste; instead it lends a mellow finish, but it boasts a very high smoke point, so it is perfect for stir-frying.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, because if DH and I go to KFC, that is what we order. Because of this, I was really only judging this on the coating and seasoning. I had to leave out the chives, because I didn&#039;t have any. I knew that I would have to adjust the cooking time significantly because of the cut of chicken I was using, so that wasn&#039;t a problem. My issues were with the seasoning and coating. Maybe if I didn&#039;t have the KFC flavor in mind when I was making this, I would&#039;ve been happier with it. Even with all the herbs and spices in the coating, this chicken was very bland. It smelled great when cooking, but didn&#039;t taste like it had seasoning at all. The coating was also nothing like KFC&#039;s. I&#039;m wondering if KFC&#039;s actual coating is in a batter form, rather than an egg-to-flour dip. I think this would&#039;ve been vastly improved with the addition of brined chicken and some more salt or some Spike seasoning in the coating. It&#039;s not that this was inedible or anything -- I&#039;ll be using this in some chicken sandwiches. I was just really hoping that this would recreate that KFC flavor, but it completely missed the mark in that arena, and that is what I am rating.

I added some onion too cause I had it and then I heated the shrimp in the mixture until heated and placed them on the pasta.

I used the microwave method this time because I was running short on time. I can&#039;t wait to try it roasted. I love roasted vegetables. I imagine roasting the squash would make it even more flavorful. We were skeptical about trying this in place of pasta but my daughter and I both liked it even more than spaghetti! I served it with Paul Newman&#039;s marinara sauce with cooked ground beef in it. UPDATED: I tried roasting it according to Recipe #162765 and didn&#039;t think it was worth the time or hour of having the oven going when using the microwaves works just as well. We didn&#039;t notice it being any different in taste or texture. I&#039;ve since served Recipe #373844 and Recipe #76 over the spaghetti squash cooked this way and everyone has LOVED it.

I got 26 cookies which made them only 2 points plus each. According to the recipe builder on the WW site, if you only get 24 cookies, it is 2 points plus for 1 cookie but 5 points plus for 2. I substituted a small box of instant vanilla pudding for the custard powder. I also didn&#039;t have self-rising flour so I used the appropriate equivalents of baking powder, salt and regular flour. At first, they were a little salty. As they sat, that seemed to mellow out a bit. Not sure if it because I use sea salt or if Australian self-rising flour has a different ratio of salt. Next time, I&#039;ll use less. I used just a tad more than 8 Tbls. of Land-O-Lake&#039;s light butter to get the 120 grams. (Maybe the Australian light butter isn&#039;t salted?)

I didn&#039;t have enough tomato soup, so I  added what I had and supplemented it with canned stewed tomatoes. I had a handful of leftover canned peas in the fridge with no liquid, so I added those, plus some frozen peas. Like another reviewer, I added some beef broth to make up for the missing liquid. I forgot to pick up some Burgundy wine while I was out, so I used some Chianti instead (closest sub on hand). This does come out thinner than what I would expect in beef stew, so I tend to think of this more like a hearty veggie beef soup than a beef stew, but that was perfectly fine with me -- didn&#039;t make it any less tasty! Oh, and I needed it to cook longer than 5 hours, so I did this in the crockpot overnight (~8 hours on low, then maybe another 45 minutes on high because my potatoes and carrots needed to cook just a bit more).

Quick and easy to make, this was a big hit at my house.  I doubled the gravy ingredients to give us lots of sauce, and because we like our sauce a little on the thicker side, I added more flour to get the consistency that we like. The dough for the biscuits was very sticky and a little hard to work with, but stick with it and it will come together.  After removing the biscuits from the oven, I brushed the tops with butter to soften and add extra flavor.

Based on pantry availability, I used Hellmann&#039;s mayo, black lumpfish caviar, and some chopped dill. I forgot to buy chives, and I didn&#039;t have any cognac or acceptable subs in the house, so those were left out. The caviar spread was still really tasty, though. My first instinct was to put some cheese on my sandwich because I love cheese on sandwiches, but I&#039;m glad that I didn&#039;t -- I think it would have been too rich with the caviar spread. I don&#039;t buy rye bread because I don&#039;t like it, so I had this on a soft pretzel roll instead (which was lovely here, btw). I&#039;d definitely like to try this again when I have cognac to add. Made small, these would be perfect sandwiches to serve at an afternoon tea  or a shower. Thanks for posting, Jackie!

We weren&#039;t crazy about the cake, this is more of a  genoise  and the texture was a bit odd with the peaches not what you expect from upside down cake; I also found it to be a bit bland.

With that method, the butter did not burn and remained sweet.  We&#039;re not big fans of mayonnaise in this house, but we do use butter.

There was no fluffiness, and it was pourable and grainy. It still tasted good, but was not good as a dip, so I threw that batch away and started over (luckily, I had enough of the ricotta and mascarpone left over to do so). Round 2, I watched it like a hawk, and I turned off the mixer at about 2 minutes because I was paranoid, lol. MUCH better results, fluffy and delicious!

This was perfect with a big scoop of Brazilian white rice. I did make this with a full 2lbs of shrimp, since I didn&#039;t see any reason not to add the extra half-pound that was in the bag.

A bit sweeter than I usually make pizza sauce, but the beer keeps it from being overly sweet. I used this on a Shipyard beer-flavored pizza crust, topped with lots of shredded mozzarella, sliced Genoa salami and chopped-up portabella mushroom caps. This makes quite a bit of sauce (probably enough for at least 4 or 5 heavily-sauced large pizzas, I&#039;m guessing), so I froze the remainder of my batch so it won&#039;t spoil before I can use it up (can&#039;t be filling up on personal pizzas right now, not with Quest food to be eaten, haha).

393479,coffee concentrate,8,2,5,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67728,2014-08-27,"Sometimes I like to make my own iced coffee at home to save money, so this was perfect for me. In fact, this saves me even more money than when I make iced coffee from hot coffee like I usually do, because with this I need less ice (I buy ice because we use so much of it, and my fridge icemaker is broken). Three things I learned the hard way: 1. definitely use a gallon-sized container to make this --  I started with a 3 quart container, which is big enough for the water and some of the coffee, but not ALL the coffee, 2. don&#039;t skimp on cheesecloth layers -- that sneaky coffee grit will wiggle it&#039;s way into your strained coffee and you will need to strain it a second time if you are not into crunchy coffee, and 3. cold-brewed coffee apparently has much more caffeine in it than hot-brewed coffee. Like, makes-Starbucks-coffee-seem-weak levels of caffeine. While I do like an occasional iced coffee in the summertime when I&#039;m feeling like a human flat tire, I don&#039;t drink coffee every day. Heck, sometimes I won&#039;t drink any coffee for a couple of weeks or so. This keeps me from building up a tolerance, so I&#039;m pretty caffeine-sensitive -- I get a lot of bang for my buck energy-wise from a cup of coffee. When I do drink coffee, it tends to be big ones, so I made a 1-to-1 ratio large iced coffee from this. Tasted lovely this way, but I will definitely add more water and/or milk in the next cup I make, since I felt like I was on the verge of cardiac arrest after finishing today&#039;s coffee, LOL.

Not quite there, but good nonetheless. The beans I bought were not as soft as the beans that I usually buy, so I mashed them almost completely to soften them up a bit more. Because of the beans I used, I also needed to use extra olive oil to make them more creamy, too. I used the full amount of crushed red pepper, and I added a bit of garlic paste. I also used smoked sea salt in place of the regular salt. This went perfectly with some Mediterranean-seasoned pita chips.

Such a pretty shade of pink, although I couldn&#039;t get any photos that reflected that, sadly. I used some storebought roast beef for the meat, and some Grey Poupon for the mustard (forgot to buy spicy brown mustard). Mine was probably a bit more tangy than intended because I only had pickled beets to use, but that was fine with me, since I&#039;m quite partial to pickled stuff. I found that the flavor improves after a bit of chill time, and this keeps well. I removed the egg slices for storage of the leftovers, so not sure about how they would fare if left on top, though.

I&#039;m really glad I did, because this stuff is addictive! I did have to make a few changes based on availability (and ability to fully open the recipe &gt;:x ). I used Quaker Whole Hearts for the Cheerios, and pretzel twists instead of sticks (same taste, just different shapes). I couldn&#039;t locate any Bugles, so I used a mix of corn Chex and queso fundido flavored Cheez-It Zings (the Chex for a similar Bugles crunch, the Zings because they sounded good). I had mixed all the crunchies together last night, but DH wanted to watch a movie, so I bagged it and decided to coat and bake it today. When I went to check the recipe for seasoning amounts, I could only get the top half of the recipe to open, so I guessed 1 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. AFTER I finished baking it, the recipe decided to fully load, and I noticed that I used double the seasoning. I think I will make all future batches with &quot;screwed up&quot; seasoning, because it was delicious! Thanks for posting this keeper, and sorry I had to sub so much (I&#039;m now on a mission to find Bugles for when this batch is gone, lol)! Made for Sweet December Tag 2014",5

UPDATE: I have been making this with more sweet potato, and that really works out well for us - I think that the balance between sweet potato and chorizo is better with more chorizo. I love how easy this is- the chorizo provides all the seasoning you need, so it&#039;s so simple to make for weeknight dinners.",4

Even using the &quot;no taste&quot; red coloring, the large amount used can be tasted.  Two tablespoon was a little overkill. The cocoa flavor in red velvet is usually just a hint, but there wasn&#039;t a trace of it in the taste at all . The icing was great. The recipe made a ton. It held its shape enough to pipe a basic mound of icing on top, but not to do anything like a star tip or rosette. I&#039;ll have to add additional powdered sugar to do that.

I used Quorn cutlets, still frozen, dipped them in the marinade and then into the crumb mixture. No need to let them dry like the chicken, just drizzle with the butter and pop them in the oven until golden brown.  Even though they were frozen, they were done 5-10 minutes before the pan of chicken. Please note, it is very important that you use the Quorn still frozen. If you let it defrost before using, it will dry out in the oven, and if you let it soak in the marinade all you will have left is mush.)

After this I place the cubes in the microwave and I partially dried it. For the sauce I fried the onion, added the cubed (still not completely dry) bread, I added 5 fresh extra sage leaves (sliced) and I roasted/dried the bread. After this I could continue as explained. As chicken broth I used the fond of my chicken from the weekend. I scaled down the recipe to 1/3 and this was really filling for us four in combination with yellow risotto and salad.

I couldn&#039;t find tarragon vinegar. I used red wine vinegar instead. I also substituted farmer&#039;s cheese for the goat cheese. One, because the cost of good goat cheese was insane. And two, because the taste of cheap goat cheese is usually nasty. I marinated them for about 24 hours. I spooned the marinated over the cheese balls 2-3 times during that period. I refrigerated it while it marinated, which made the olive oil solidify. I let it set out for the last few hours to bring it back to room temp. I might actually let it marinade at room temp next time. Everyone loved the flavor and the ease of serving them versus one large cheese ball. I&#039;ll be making these again for sure!!",5

Don&#039;t expect the cauliflower to be coated in oil and crumbs. Little bits stick to the cauliflower and give it a lot of flavor, but you also have lots of separate bits of crumbs that don&#039;t stick. This is a good thing!

I had to pull it out, cut the meat away from the bone &amp; chop it, rather than shred it. I am thinking that next time I&#039;ll use more liquid to almost cover the meat, as the bottom part resting in the liquid was far easier to shred. Due to time, I could let it cool b/f shredding--that might have been part of the problem. I used the cooking liquid as instructed but had a hard time separating the fat from the liquid--so there was lot of splattering! I didn&#039;t let the liquid cook down completely b/c of the mess, but the meat crisped up very well still. To reheat, my husband thought he should spritz a little water on it to keep the meat from drying out. And the meal was a huge success, despite these issues!

Only three stars because there's a lot missing in the recipe. First of all, the grated zucchini needs to be sprinkled with a little salt and left to sit for about 10 minutes so you can then squeeze all the water out. This is probably what caused the wet texture for people who had problems. Also, creamed corn tends to come in bigger cans than 300g, but fortunately I had a kitchen scale to weigh out the right amount. The muffins themselves also needed a bit of salt, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon added. Or a larger amount of salt used to draw the water out from the zucchini.

I got about 14 little ~2 1/2&quot; long rolls out of this after looking at the blog for direction, and I can't imagine that anyone but those with a demonic-level sweet tooth could eat much more than one or two rolls at a sitting (this coming from a rabid buttercream frosting eater!). Not sure I would classify this as a dessert, either. This is more of a candy/confection, although there are people out there who grab a couple mints or hard candies off the counter in restaurants after dinner and call that dessert, so to each his own. I didn't have any pretty colored cellophane to wrap these in, so I just opted for pieces of garden-variety plastic wrap. Not as cute, but it did the job. Just some tips for ease of handling: this stuff is super-sticky and thick, so be sure to either oil or wet your hands before even thinking about sticking them in the bowl to grab the mixture, and repeat as needed. Also, do not lay the rolls down before you sugar them, or you will need a bench knife to get them back up again. Much easier to dip as you roll each one (I learned this the hard way!). Lastly, don't bother scrubbing the bowl with your mixing-fatigued arms -- just fill it with hot water and some dish soap, and come back later when everything has melted off on it's own. Now I'd like to try the cooked version with liquid milk instead of the powdered milk. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2016 Phillipines for Team Iota Eta Pi",4

I didn't even use these as a side dish, they were my lunch today. I used some little Campari tomatoes for this, and I sprinkled the tops with some grated Parmesan cheese after baking. I will definitely be making these again, but next time, I will use fresh toasted breadcrumbs in place of the prepackaged ones. The flavor was good with the prepackaged ones, but I'm certain that the texture of the filling would be much better with the fresh breadcrumbs. In hindsight, I think the filling needs less breadcrumbs and/or more liquid if using the storebought breadcrumbs (the filling was tasty, but a tad thick and dry). Not detracting from my rating, though, because it was my own mistake. The only fresh breadcrumbs I had on hand were Portuguese sweet bread crumbs, and I didn't think those would be appropriate here. As Annacia mentioned in her review, these would also be good with some crumbled sausage, diced ham or some flaked cooked fish in the filling if you wanted to use this as a light meal in place of a side dish. Now I have a really good use for all my garden tomatoes that are just starting to ripen, yay! Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2016 Azores Vegetal Challenge for Team Iota Eta Pi",5

I messed them up, but didn't catch my mistake until it was too late, so I just ran with it. After I made my three rolls, I was out of the walnut mixture but still had another 9 sheets of phyllo left over. I went back and reread the recipe, and realized that I had misunderstood it and made each of my rolls with only three sheets of the phyllo instead of 6. Since there was no way I was unrolling the three rolls to add the extra phyllo, I just used the remaining sheets to make two other types of cookies: I made two rolls filled with cinnamon and coconut sugar, and I made a third roll filled with raspberry orange mango jam. The cinnamon sugar ones I cut into logs, and the jam filled roll I sliced just like the walnut filled ones. The cinnamon sugar logs were actually pretty good, but the jam filled ones were just way too sweet. They baked up pretty, because they spread into rose shapes once the jam melted, but I ended up throwing them away because if something is too sweet for ME, I know no one else will be able to handle them, lol. The walnut filled ones were good with just the three sheets of phyllo in them, but they were really fragile. I baked these for the full 30 minutes, but I think I could've shaved off a minute or two, because some of the bottoms were starting to get a little bit burnt at 30 minutes. I poured the syrup over the baked cookies, but it seemed to just go right through them to the bottom of the pan. I tried one of the warm walnut filled ones, and was kind of disappointed because they were super-sweet and kind of dry. I thought about it for a minute, and realized that what I needed to do was: 1. Keep spooning the syrup over the cookies, flipping them periodically so the syrup wouldn't just sit and make the bottoms soggy, and 2. Allow these to cool. After I got the syrup to start soaking into the whole cookies, I popped the whole pan into the fridge. Not long enough to chill them, but just long enough to make everything a bit less squishy and more cohesive. Once I did those two things, these became much more like the familiar texture of baklava, and it tamed the sweetness a bit. No getting around it, syrup-soaked phyllo pastries are gonna be really sweet regardless, but letting them cool first keeps the sweetness from being overly cloying. These definitely need a time out after baking to be their best selves. In the end, these tasted good enough to be comparable to the little Greek phyllo pastries on a tray that my mom buys for the holidays. Thanks for posting, sheepdoc!

I used multi grain flatbread wraps, American cheese, lettuce, pickles, tomato and a little bit of honey chipotle mustard (I warmed the wrap/chicken/cheese in the microwave at work, and added all the cold veggies afterwards). For the chicken, I let it marinate overnight before cooking it. I didn't have light beer, so I used Modelo instead. Once the chicken was fully cooked, I removed it from the sauce and continued to simmer the sauce for a while to reduce it and thicken it up (didn't want the chicken to get overcooked). Very tasty chicken, and versatile, too! Thanks for posting this keeper! Made for CQ 2017 Central America",5

I used skirt steak for the beef, and I added one chopped cucumber and a handful of chopped green olives to this. Instead of using the lime wedges for garnish, I just squeezed the juice from one lime into the salad, and I mixed in some chopped cilantro as well. Little bit spicy, little bit tangy, and very fresh tasting. The only thing I would do differently next time is either use a different cut of beef, or cook the skirt steak longer to make it a bit more tender. This was perfect for lunch as a tostada topping. Probably gonna make a pot of soup from the leftover beef broth, too. I'll definitely be making this again, thanks for posting! Made for CQ 2017 Central America",5

I am giving 5 stars because the beauty of this recipe is its versatility--I have used cashew butter, chocolate chips, and dried cherries together, almond butter with chocolate chips and mint extract, and peanut butter with chocolate chips and crushed pretzels. I always use old fashioned oats pulsed in my coffee grinder a bit, and I often use a mixture of rice crispy cereal and plain cheerios (those cereals that languish in the pantry toward the end of the box LOL). You can totally make these in the microwave; I mix the nut butter, honey, and about 1/4 sugar and microwave for about 45 seconds, stir, then pop it back in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Easy peasy and dangerously quick! The only major tweak I make every time is one I highly recommend--if you use natural nut butters, add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the dry ingredients. It will make these taste much more like their store bought counterparts. My kids and I inhale these almost as fast as I can make them, so thank you for the recipe!",5

DH is used to some Italian-Americans making it for a sporting club. I have avoided recipes for spaghetti that don't involve cans of tomato product. DH had critiques requesting bigger pieces of clam so he could taste the clam easily so I would try whole baby clams next time. I was not sure at all I would like this dish, plain and simple. But I did enjoy it very much, despite my prejudices. I was surprised that the recipe did indeed need an entire bunch of parsley. I splurged on DeCecco spaghetti noodles, the best noodles at my local market, and I was glad I did. I made the recipe with 10 oz. of spaghetti noodles, although there were only 2 of us.

Perfect for Bar Food, people will order more and more beer to calm the seasonings! I went in a different direction than most reviewers: I used ALL of the butter called for, and it ALL ended up in the sauce. Cajuns like their butter! In the Sauce, I changed to: 4 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp white pepper, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp Tabasco, and a rounded 1/2 cup of chopped green onion. In the Chicken Seasoning, I changed to: 1/4 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp black pepper, rounded 1/4 tsp cumin. My sauce reduced to a dense chili-like sauce after 1 hour of simmering. Using 1/2 cup of butter to cook the chicken cubes ensured that the chicken cubes were submerged in the hot liquid, and therefore cooked more evenly. I call this a &quot;Manly Meal&quot; because the flavoring is intense, but, oddly, the amounts of spices I used didn't quite reach 2-alarm hotness that a measly 0.01 ounce Thai Chili Pepper produced the night before. Because the spices are so intense and so likely to stain whatever container, I would not recommend doubling the sauce and freezing for another day. Cajun cooking requires time to seal in layers of seasoning - so why not make it a quasi-religious experience the day you plan to eat it? By the way, we gobbled this up, and experienced no digestive complaints. We will make this again (just not right before having labs drawn or a doctor's appointment)!

It's hard in the U.S. to find a &quot;normal&quot; chicken breast. Although the breasts were well seared in the given cooking time (I guessed at medium-high heat, no heat level was specified), they were way under-cooked. I added about 4 minutes per side. During this time, I wished I had chosen to cook the breasts sous vide instead - that way I would be certain that the breasts had reached the proper temperature throughout, then I could have seared them just before serving (and I wouldn't have to clean the stove area from grease splatters).

I usually don’t go out of my way to eat nuts, but I’m a sucker for pralines and candied pecans. I really like the salt with the sweet in the coating here. I only added one tweak: I added the lightest sprinkle of ground cayenne pepper to the coating before adding the pecans. It’s just a hint of something in the flavor, probably not something you could pinpoint and identify if you didn’t know ahead of time, but it’s there, and it’s good! Now I just need them to completely cool off so I can put them away and go to bed before I stand in front of the stove and polish off the whole darn batch myself!

I finished off a bottle of brandy for this recipe, so had just under 1/2 cup, but that was fine. Goes to show you how a recipe like this can be flexible.

The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 teaspoon minced, fresh garlic to the cream cheese mixture. Yummy! **Made for 2018 Football Pool**",5

I also used dried parsley and reduced fat feta, as that is what I had on hand. Turn out great. DH suggested making it for New Years Eve, as we have several dietary restrictions in our family and this is something we all can eat.",4

I used a roll of vegetaria ground sausage that I cooked in the first step and then added back to the pot at the very end with the lemon. I had a large bunch of kale, one large can of beans, baby carrots (cut) and jarred mince garlic. Even with these changes, the soup turned out fantastic. Even DH, who made a face when I told him what was for dinner, enjoyed it.",5

I assumed my batter may be on the thin side because of this. However, the batter was very thick. I was tempted to add more liquid, but decided to attempt it as is. They were so thick that I was afraid they wouldn't cook through. I cooked them at a lower temperature so the outside wouldn't get done before the inside. They turned out fine, very thick and fluffy. It made eight very filling pancakes.",4

I apologize for not putting my tweaks under tweaks. In a bit of a hurry but wanted to thank previous reviews for helping me. I used 2 eggs, and I needed all the flour (I think some people said they didn't need it all). I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. The dough was easy to roll, and I'm new to rolling out cookies. I believe my cookies took 8 min at 350. I've wanted to do shaped cookies for a long time; wasn't sure if I had the skills. After learning how to roll things like pizza dough I started to feel more confident to handle cookies. This recipe was a big blessing a big help for me!",5

I got a package of fresh sliced mushrooms from the produce department and just threw the whole thing in. Being December, I wasn't able to use fresh parsley from the garden. I have some that I dried at the end of the season so I just adjusted the amount accordingly and used that. It was just my husband and me tonight. But, we both really enjoyed it. In fact he was hesitant and only took a little at first, but went back for more after trying it.",4

The batter was really thin and the texture was softer than we like. They get mushy before you can eat them once you add syrup. The flavor was fine. Next time I will play with the ingredient measurements and see if I can get them closer to a traditional waffle.,3
