Didn't seem to matter, though, since everybody agreed it was sensational.  I used 3 chipotles, seeds and all, and the heat level was actually pretty mild.  Thanks for a really top-notch recipe, Rita!  Update:  Six years and a whole lot of bowls of potato salad later, I don't think I've ever served this to anyone who didn't rave.

With that being said, I also noticed I ran out of canned black beans, so I ended up adding a can of pinto and a can of soy beans, plus I added 2 cups of frozen corn kernels. Since I added the corn and more beans, I found I only needed to simmer the soup for 30 minutes for it to thicken up. I did want to mention... when saute'ing the vegetables in oil, I did use 2-1/2 tablespoons, plus I added a bit more carrots (2/3's cup). I saute'd the vegetables for 9 minutes before adding the garlic, and after adding the garlic, I only saute'd it for 1 more minute. I enjoyed this soup topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. I do think by adding the hickory flavored liquid smoke, it gave the soup lots of flavor. My husband and I enjoyed this soup, and I will make this again, but with the modifications I made. Little Bee, thanks for sharing the recipe!!",5

That may have been my fault though because I made homemade refried beans. Next time I'll omit the salt and might try making my own taco seasoning w/o it.

I would definitely do that again, and possible add more. I am not a huge fan of chips, so the chip layer was so-so for me, but DH liked it. I think next time I might try noodles instead and maybe double the beans and 1/2 the meat.

The Quorn only took 20-25 minutes and I did not defrost the cutlets before baking.  The only thing I may do differently is reduce the amount of seasoned salt next time.  It was just a little on the strong side.  I will be adding this to my cook book for sure. Thanks!!",5

Sesame oil is a very nice flavor , however, a heavy hand can ruin the dish. Since I didn't make chicken in the recipe (made breaded, baked chicken breast tenders instead), I added some ground ginger & garlic powder with just a pinch of cayenne pepper to my sauce. I also steamed some broccoli and mixed it altogether with the noodles to complete the meal. Overall, it was received very well by my one year old, 7 year old and hubby. There were plenty of noodles left over (a pound is a lot around here), so I'm thinking about some cold noodles tomorrow for lunch with maybe a few sliced onions & sugar snap peas for crunch!

I had fresh tomatoes on hand that I wanted to use up...used 4 garlic instead of 2...and added about 1 T of hot chili paste. The sauce turned out quite thick, so I added water to make a better consistency.  The cloves imparted a unique taste that I quite enjoyed.  I added a parmesan rind for flavor.  To prevent the onions and garlic sticking, I sprayed my Dutch oven with Pam and cooked them at a lower heat and had no problems with burning.  Next time, I would probably use fresh basil for a fresher taste. I used your recipe for meatballs and just plopped them in the Dutch oven, let them cook for  about 10 minutes, then stirred them around...then simmering them for 3 hours.  This is not the ""run of the mill"" type of sauce and turned out something quite unique.  The cloves do make a difference, but you have to like the taste in the first place!

There was no way I was going to get 2 tsp pork/shrimp mixture in that wrapper.  That took me about 4 wrapper duds to figure that one out!!  I could only find square wrappers, so that made them all that more fragile!  Second, I had partial froze the wrappers, but was in a rush so ended up putting them all together in a Tupperware and when I went to use them, they were one solid block.  I did a trial run with DH and took out about 12 wrappers.  They were thawed out before they went into the skillet, but even with the oil in the skillet and the broth afterwards, they ended up sticking so badly, the finished product was not very appealing! With my style of cooking,  I probably wouldn't use them as an appitizer, as I don't like doing last minute cooking before my guests and having to worry about the extra clean up!!!  Now with all that negative comments being said, here is the postive.  They tasted really great!  I decided to use the leftovers in a won ton soup!  I seasoned the chicen broth with sesame oil and soy sauce, brought the broth to a boil and added the frozen wrappers and cooked them for 2 minutes or until they all floated to the surface.  As I have 50  wrappers leftover, next time, I will add tofu, some chopped green onions and maybe some bean sprouts!  If I was to make the wrappers all over again, I would freeze them individually and place them flat with a layer of parchment or waxed paper in between.  I would definately consider omitting the cabbage, as it was more of a pain to get it in the wrappers and it was hardly noticed in the taste!  You have to have enough time to play around with these....I figured they took me 2-1/2 hours to complete them.  They were something interesting to do, and I might do them again if I am doing a Chinese theme type of dinner",0

I used Good Seasons Italian, Hidden Valley Ranch Original and Buttermilk and generic gravy mix. I served it with egg noodles and green salad. The packets were expensive where I live. I spent $10 in packets. Next time I might try it with vegetables thrown in. It was great as written though. Enjoy! ChefDLH",5

I thought I would try to fix it in the crock pot (due to the extreme heat) and it does work.  I wasn't sure how long to cook it, but 4 hours on HI for 4 breasts (2.25 lbs) was too long.  The chicken was dry and the rice over cooked.  Next time I will go for 3 to 3-1/2 hours and increase the water (may sub out low sodium chicken broth) by 1/4 cup.  I think it would also be good to add in a poblano or green pepper & maybe a can of chopped green chilies for a little extra ""zip"".  Over all, very nice, EASY recipe that I will make again.

It definitely satisfied my craving for sandwiches and I didn't want to cave and use regular bread.  I used rice flour and potato starch because that is what I had on hand.  I also used reular yeast.  I put all the ingredients in my bread maker to knead and rise and then put it in the oven to bake.  i might try using the tapioca flour next time.  It tasted a little yeasty.,4

I used it to get to another product I'd seen on food.com without all the steps.  In essence, I added two cups of frozen triple berry blend. I put a tablespoon of flour and a little sugar in with the berries & mixed them prior to adding in.  And I added them right before stirring in the milk.  That made the mixture purple, but the cake came out a good color.  <br/><br/>I really didn't like the glaze step because it had me fearful of sogginess--which my husband complained of.  He also complained of too much lemon flavor.  I thought the opposite--not enough, but he got the edge piece so that's probably why.  Anyway, due to those complaints, I'll follow other reviewer's suggestions and either put more lemon juice into the cake--trading 1/4 cup of milk out for 1/4 cup of it then not add the glaze. Or I'll use POWDERED sugar, rather than normal sugar, in the glaze to thicken it.",3

So I put the minced onion in that mix but then it said to cook the minced onion with the meat. I did both. It cooked for 8 hours and was wonderful. As a previous poster did I added one can of refried beans in for one can of the kidney beans blended as I didn't have a working blender and it was great. This is a less chunky chili so if you prefer more chunks add some bell pepper, more beans or chunks of onion or even chunks of beef. If not enjoy it's smooth texture. Served with bowls of cheese, white raw onion, avocado etc for toppings. Thanks Debbie. Enjoy! Chef DLH",5

But this recipe gets 5 stars for when I got ease.  I took my chicken breast right from the freezer and tossed them in the crock pot with the sauce and onion. The house smelled wonderful when I got home from work. I shredded the chicken because it was falling apart.  Next time I may shred it a little sooner so it can really soak up the sauce.,5

He had two helpings, added some of the leftovers to his eggs in the morning (gross, I know), and took the last of the leftovers for lunch today.  It was really a great meal, and I think the key is the spaghetti sauce.  I used a homemade sauce that I threw together when I realized I didn't have any jarred sauce and I took the advice of other reviewers and added another 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes to the recipe. I also used turkey instead of beef and whole wheat spaghetti. I didn't have enough cheddar cheese for the whole casserole so I used a blend of cheddar, Italian blend and Parmesan.  I also added some dehydrated onions when I cooked the turkey for some extra yum.  I layered everything in my Pampered Chef deep covered baker, baked for 15 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  The result was a perfectly cooked casserole that I could eat once a week.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe that is so easily adapted!  We will make this one quite often.",5

I've made them twice now, and both times I've skipped the soaking step and used the parchment paper method, allowing me to use the entire turn table in the microwave to place the potatoes on (the only microwave safe dishes I have are much smaller, so would limit the number of chips I can cook at a time).  I re-spray the parchment each batch, and definitely reduce the number of minutes to cook each batch.  First batch took 10 minutes, down to about 6 minutes for the 5th or 6th batch.  I just used salt and pepper.  I was considering making them for a BBQ tomorrow, but I think it would take way too long to cook enough batches for 15 people (I can eat almost 2 whole potatoes worth just by myself if I'm not careful!).  Potato chips are one of my weaknesses, so I'm really happy to have an almost guilt free way to eat them!  Thank you!",0

My tenderloin was a little too rare for our liking; not sure if it was under cooked or cooked perfectly but looked under cooked based on how we usually cook it (we may just over cook it usually).  Was very tender and juicy and I just sauteed the slices in a pan for a couple minutes on each side to be sure it was cooked through.  Will use this method again; even with cooking the tenderloin slices afterwards it still turned out more moist and tender than any other way we have cooked it.

I don't like crock pot cooking so I used the dutch oven method (90 minutes at 350) and the chicken thighs were cooked perfectly. I also added the rest of the coconut milk (1 can minus the 1 cup for the rice) and used medium fresh salsa from the grocery store. I put limes in my cart at the store but somewhere along the way my 2 year old ejected them and I didn't notice. So I substituted white vinegar for acidity. I'm sure this took away from the flavor of the dish though.<br/>Overall we liked the flavors a lot, but the texture, between the rice and the sauce, was a little gummy. This is where some fresh lime juice right before serving would have come in really handy; I think it would have cut the thickness of the sauce beautifully. So next time, and there will be a next time, I will make sure to have the limes at the ready.<br/>My 2 and 3 1/2 year old daughters and husband enjoyed the meal, but my 6 and 7 year old sons were not that thrilled with it.

This recipe goes into my hard copy ""Family Favorites"" cookbook.

Yes, I am a recipe tweaker, but hear my case...it was just what I was looking for, like a needle in a haystack...a recipe without creamed condensed soups. Well, I started with a recipe that did call for a creamed soup and came across this one for inspriation.  I cooked the chicken breasts in a crock pot with 3 stalks of celery and 1 whole, chopped onion, seasoned with pepper & Adobo garlic salt. I let that cook until done. Set the chicken aside, and took all the veggies, juice from crock pot & a can of chopped green chiles and pureed adding broth to that to equal the amount called for in the recipe. Made the roux...and the rest of the recipe as follows. Loved it. Kids all but licked their plates (unknowingly eating onions, celery and onions). Served with my black beans and rice. Thanks for saving me from a creamed soup compliation! We will definetly be making this one again.

This was ok.  Everyone ate it but no one wanted seconds. I had issues some of the other posters have noted. The ""sauce"" was runny like soup and not creamy. Next time I would have to omit some liquid. The cream cheese didn't dissolve in the last hour properly. I think I will warm it with the soups then add it in if I made it again. Not as easy as this states but would be creamier. The color was plain and the flavor was a tad bland. I would need to find a seasoning mix of herbs to jazz it up. The plus of the recipe was the chicken was falling apart and not dried out. It was easy and fast. Definitely add more mushrooms. This was made as written. We served it atop a choice of egg noodles or rice. Thanks for posting. Enjoy! ChefDLH",3

After reading the reviews I made some adjustments to the method as well as ingredients.  I have never had the Panda Express version so wasn't likely to be disappointed. :)<br/>First I made the sauce in a small saucepan, choosing to saute the ginger and garlic at that point rather than adding it to the wok prior to cooking the chicken.  I included the cornstarch so it was ready to go.  I tripled the sauce and was glad I did.  <br/>Along with some other reviewers I dipped the chicken in the egg mixture and then dredged it with flour before frying it in a wok with the chili peppers and green onions etc.  This streamlined the process as I was not required to set aside the chicken other than to wipe out the pan.  Tossed in the sauce and 5 minutes later we were eating.  This is definitely a Five Star tasting recipe but in fairness I can only give it four for all the adjustments I thought necessary.  Thanks for posting this yummy chicken dish.  We will be enjoying it for many years to come.",4

In any case, it was just too much, in my opinion (and I adore garlic.)  I think next time I'll cut it back to 3 cloves fresh and 1/2-3/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I have to admit that I made a substitution of canned milk for the light cream (I had no cream) and made a mistake in the layering order, ending up with cheese on top, which made a crunchy cheese layer, but that didn't change the flavor, only the texture.  I also didn't have any seasoned salt, so I just used plain salt and cut it back to just shy of 1 tsp. for the entire dish, and that was very much more than plenty.  I used just 1 pound of ground beef, and that was also plenty of meat.  Perhaps the larger amont of beef would have been able to handle the additional 1/2 tsp. salt, but I doubt it.  (The soup has a lot of salt in it already, and the dish was very salty with the scant 1 tsp.)  This dish is a lot like the flat enchiladas I often make using corn tortillas instead of the potatoes - both are wonderful family dishes.<br/><br/>After reading comments about the potatoes taking a long time to cook, I started out the dish with slicing the potatoes and putting them in water on the stove to boil.  When the sides of the pot were boiling, I then turned off the flame and let them sit in the hot water as I prepared the remaining items.  It did help, but still took 1 1/2 hours to get done, and could have easily cooked another 1/2 hour before the potatoes turned mushy.  So, parboiling or pre-cooking the potatoes is definately in order if you have any time limit in your schedule.",4

Zapped the mix with my immersion blender until smooth, then added extra sharp cheddar and a ~3oz lump of 2% Velveeta for extra flavor.  Perfect texture, not too thick at all.

These changes were all based on other reviews I read.  I then used my stick blender to blend it all up. I did end up adding a handful of mini-chocolate chips for my kids.  They all really liked the pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I read other reviewers' comments first so I felt comfortable throwing in about 3 oz of shiitake mushrooms that needed using up (this worked really well) when I added the onions, added the extra egg for moisture (perfect), mixed a favorite BBQ sauce that needed using with 4.5 oz of tomato sauce, then used the rest of the originally 8 oz tomato sauce can over the top of the meatloaf 20 minutes into cooking.

I cooked the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, mushroom, and bell pepper in some bacon grease first then added the tomatoes (used a 15oz can plus the juices), lentils (I had less then called for and they were grey not red), spices (used dried because that is what I had), and stock (used chicken base not vegetable).  Had no decent green beans so omitted those.  Was feeding two hungry teenagers so threw some potatoes in the pot and was really generous with the spinach (I had a lot that needed to be used up).  It all cooked up lovely, but a little sharp because of the tinned tomatoes. So I smoothed out the flavors with a couple of dashes of balsamic vinegar. Served with crusty bread on a blustery day.  It was well received.  So I guess, I didn't change this recipe ""a bit"" but rather ""a lot.""  Ner.

Used 1 can white kidney which I tried mashing in the crockpot then I pureed 1 can red kidney in my bullet plus 2 cans red kidney. Used spices as specified but instead of minced onion I used dehydrated onion. Can hardly wait to taste and will additional comment in a couple of days. Its not cook off yet but we had some for our supper tonight and we found it soupy and bland so I added in the remaining spice blend and its back on the burner to try and thicken up. Added some more cayenne and cumiin plus some worster sauce. At the last hour before serving today I added a dollop of my tomatillo salsa made with thai chilies and finally I was happier with it.

White meat was moist and delicious, better than brined turkeys I've made in the past and so much simpler. Strained the drippings and made gravy which was a good, simple turkey gravy.

We like these flavours, and the recipe is so quick and easy. I also wonder if cooks who were not happy with the results really used real Parmesan and a good creamy Caesar salad dressing? I only added a very little extra seasoning-with-a-bite (dry Piquante Pepper seasoning/Peppadew) to the Italian herbs, but used the recipe unchanged. My chops were nicely cooked after 25 - 30 minutes, but cooking times depend so much on the different ovens. The flavour was great -- mild but tasty. I did not use loin chops (terrified of their notorious ""dryness""), but a chop cut which had some marbling running through them. So they were juicy. I should add we don't mind a little fat at all ... I'm pleased to see that some doctors and dieticians are coming round to the idea that a little animal fat (used for 1,000's of years, after all!) are not at all bad for us!!

I was searching for a frosting that hardens and allows for easier, neater cookie storage.  Only after making many modifications, the frosting turned out.  Like other reviewers, I felt the instructions for the frosting were unclear in terms of the amount of milk.  Far more than 1 tbs. is needed to achieve the right consistency, so I would suggest indicating the exact amount (or an amount closer than just 1 tbs.) would be much more helpful.  Plus once I finally reached the right consistency, I realized the flavor was lacking.  I ended up whipping 2 tbs. butter, 1/2 tsp. lemon extract and 1/2 tsp. salt into the mixture for more flavor and less tacky texture.  The frosted cookies did harden, as the recipe title promises.  The trick must be the addition of corn syrup.  Next time, I think I'll just add corn syrup to my standard butter-based frosting recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This time I I wanted to have it well seasoned and know I picked the right recipe. I still used the turkey bag, so I followed the instructions other than putting the chicken broth in the bottom and doing the last few steps. The turkey came out juicy and tasty, and I got quite a few compliments at dinner. The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the butter/seasoning mixture really hard to spread over the turkey. It ended up in clumps that didn't melt during cooking because there was way too much seasonings for the amount of butter. I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the full amount in the butter plus sprinkle them over the top, which is what I did even though I thought it might be too much. Based on the results, next time I think I'll just add the onion and garlic to the butter and then sprinkle the rest on top. I think the butter will melt better that way and I won't end up with almost black clumps that ended up not soaking into the bird. I also didn't have tarragon but I didn't miss it at all with all of the other seasonings packing a punch!",4

While it was roasting I made yeast rolls, stuffing and side dishes, and was REALLY getting nervous about having to make gravy to feed all these people.  Naturally, I turned to Recipezaar and was so relieved to find a No-Fail Turkey Gravy recipe from a chef whose recipes I have used many times before!  I skimmed the fat from the pan drippings and added enough canned chicken broth to make the 4 cups.  Followed the directions and it turned out PERFECT.  My only comment would be that on an electric cooktop like mine I had to up the heat a little bit to get it to thicken, but once it did, I tasted it and it was delicious (no ""raw flour"" taste at all). Transferred to a small crock pot to keep warm until it can be transported to the inlaws' house in a  couple of hours.  I am sure it will be a hit!

Add a little vinegar to the water if or when an egg did cracks during boiling. It will help seal the egg. Someone suggest you start by putting the eggs in room temperature water and then bring to a boil, A pinhole in the tip of the egg will keep the shell from cracking due to trapped air.

I read many of the reviews, and it seems like the recipe has been updated since it was published in 1999, which is good, but I wish it mentioned that so you could know to ignore some of the comments.  I still found it confusing - cup measurements for the onion, celery, etc., but ounces for the chicken (fyi, 12 oz of chicken turned out to be 3 cups in my kitchen).  Also, what size tortillas?  If you buy the little ones vs. the 8 or 10"" ones, it can make a big difference.  I was also confused by the direction to break them into pieces - tear maybe, but my tortillas were too soft to ""break"".  Is the can of tomatoes optional?  Or the dicing?   It would have helped to have these things clarified.<br/><br/>That said, I did follow the recipe except where I made the following changes to make it a little healthier:  cut oil down to 1T, used McCormick's Low Sodium taco seasonings, only used 4, 8"" corn tortillas, only used 4oz of cheese in soup, used skim milk.  For the chicken, I bought a rotissery chicken from the grocery, and I used every spec of chicken on it for the 3 cups.  I think I agree with the reviewers who mentioned adding raw chicken to the 1st step as a savings - although it might not break down as much in the soup.<br/><br/>My tortillas took a LONG time to break down, and some pieces remained.  I don't agree with some reviewers who said this was quick - with over an hour of cooking time (where you have to watch and stir), and multi-step prep, this was a weekend project for me.  It did make a lot, though, I got 10, 1 cup servings from it, and I froze some for lunches.  I would make this again, but I think I would try the massa harina instead of the tortillas, it just took too long and stressed me out.",4

I warmed the milk and butter in the microwave for 30 seconds , long enough to let the butter soften (not boil). I used lemon zest and canned blueberries that I had on hand. I sprinkled Sugar in the Raw on top the muffins before baking but it sunk into the batter while baking. I wish they would have browned up more on the tops, though.  The flavor is perfect and found them to be perfectly sweet, just right. I think anyone who disliked these or found the texture off, IMO  it was ""pilot error"".

I do agree the directions were a tad confusing, however after reading reviews I made some adjustments and it turned out perfect. First key is that the flour / cornstarch / egg mixutre is a WET batter. I increased to 2 eggs and a splash of water to get a thin pancake like batter consistency. I also coated the chicken pieces (I used cut up chicken breast tenderloins) in cornstarch first for about 10 minutes so the wet batter would stick to the chicken when I fried it. Second key is to use PEANUT oil if at all possible for frying. It really does make a difference in flavor. I used a wok and about a half inch of oil and the chicken turned out nice and golden brown. If you are frying in small batches, keep the fried chicken in the oven on warm on a wire rack and it won't get soggy. Third key is to use fresh ingrediants (ginger, sesame oil, etc.). I also adjusted the sauce (yes, double it!) to using a combination of white and brown sugars and reduced the vinegar by half, substituting the remaining vinegar with the juice of the orange. The zest is a must. I made the sauce in a separate sauce pot and let it reduce while the chicken was frying. I also added a cornstarch / water slurry to thicken the sauce just before I tossed it with the chicken. I will say this recipe is probably not best suited for the first time cook, however if you have the passion and the time, anyone can make it and is worth the effort.",4

I cannot compare it to Panera as making it by this recipe is the only way I have experienced this soup.  I made it healthier by using Earth Balance in place of butter, using Better than Bouillon (vegetarian no chicken base) with water instead of chicken stock.  I also used my immersion blender to cream the soup after the vegetables were tender.  The flavor  and texture of this soup is perfect for our taste!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I will definitely make again!",5

I only had 6 oz of cream cheese but that was more than enough for us as this dish is quite rich.  I did a taste test about a half hour before serving and decided it needed some colour so I threw in 3/4 C of peas. I also drained off about half of the cooking liquid before I added the soup mixture because there seemed to be quite alot of liquid in the crockpot and I didn't want the sauce to be too thin.  My picky teenage son liked this so that is a good thing. Thx Mille!,4

I like to try different chilis and I loved that this one was supposed to be made in the crock pot. I cooked it on low for about 12 hours (that's how long I ended up being out of the house) and the meat was tender and the flavor was fantastic. I used a little extra of the spice mix (yay for not reading the recipe very well) and I used Penzy's ground chipotle pepper instead of chili powder and it was quite spicy, but not TOO hot--and quite smoky, too. I threw in some red bell peppers I had on hand as well as most of a large onion (instead of the tablespoon) and I only had 1 lb of ground beef. Obviously this recipe is made to tinker with!

What I do know is my 7 and 5 year olds both loved it, so it's a winner in my book!  We did double the season salt, just because  potato soup can be bland.  It certainly had flavor.  I used a package of thawed hash brown potatoes to cut the work down.  This was a snap to put together.  We grated cheddar on top and cooked some turkey bacon to crumble on top as well.

This recipe works well with all sorts of modifications, additional vegetables etc. I first put the stewing beef in a few tbs vinegar and Motts Tomato Juice for 35 minutes to help them become tender and give it some extra flavour. After I drained them and began the recipe. I used white rice flour instead of regular flour to be gluten free. Before I added the big pieces of vegetables I cooked the meat for approximately 40 minutes longer than called for in recipe#206712 instead of beef broth as I could make it easier. I used 3 medium carrots in all, cut into big chunks rather than diced or chopped fine for more heartiness. I used one less onion than called for, though my onions were pretty big. I exchanged the thyme to marjoram due to personal preference. In addition to the called for vegetables I added some chunks of butter nut squash one time (wouldnt do it again), a large handful of fried okra one time which was a good addition, and about 1/3 cup frozen baby peas near the end of cooking time both times.

I also added instant coffee--sprinkled some in, and a spoonful of nutella to half of the muffins.  The flavors didn't stand out at all.  Guess I need to be more bold next time.  Also, the muffins weren't moist. I can possibly blame over stirring for that--though I was anxious the whole time about all that others had warned about, I stirred in my added ingredients AFTER the milk/egg mixture & maybe that's what overdid it.  Or maybe I baked it too long--20 minutes as opposed to the 25.  But if either of those things were to blame, I wish the recipe would have been more specific to prevent though issues.

Thanks for a tasty recipe!... and a healthy one to boot!  UPDATE 02/21/2013..  These are still terrific for a snack. Your kale needs to be DRY BEFORE BAKING it. So.. what I do is: the night before I make them I wash and spin dry the kale. I then put it into a new large mesh bag (the ones that you use for laundry or lingerie) and put it in my refrigerator overnight. When morning comes around your kale is nice and dry. I also bake these longer on a much lower temperature to reduce overbowning. I bake them on 275 degrees F  and check them after 10-11 minutes and take the crisp ones off while allowing the others to remain on the cookie sheet to be baked a little longer.,5

I crisped the bacon under the oven grill. I did use up a small piece of Grana Padano cheese with the cheddar. Yes, it is rich, but I am a woman who happens to love ""rich"", and it has never made me fat! <wink!> I also appreciated that your ingredients and directions were spot on.

Update:  We make this all the time now, and every time I have company they request the recipe.  Changes I've made: I add enough potatoes to just be covered by broth, so I don't measure.  I don't peel the potatoes, just cut into pieces.  I use Johnny's seasoning salt, which is wonderful.  After stirring in the cream cheese, I blend this with an immersion blender to break up the potatoes and mix the cream cheese all the way thru, then bring it back up to serving temp.

First I lined my slow cooker with heavy duty foil, leaving enough overhang to seal after the liquids are added.  I used dry red wine instead of water, and microwaved it for about 5 minutes on high to  burn off much of the alcohol, then dissolved one can of golden mushroom soup, the dry onion soup mix, and about a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon Au Jus Base, which I then poured on top of the roast and sealed the foil tightly.

In his words, ""They are juicy and awesome and a definite DO AGAIN!""***  (**Must add that DH reviewed these after having warmed them up in the microwave the day after I baked them.  He never tried them fresh out of the oven--so I imagine that these are even more fantastic freshly prepared.)<br/><br/>Now, as a wing maker, I can tell you that this could not be easier to make and I found that the wings crisped up very nicely under the broiler.  The sauce was easy peasy to make as well. After it cooled down slightly from the microwave, I simply dumped the sauce and wings into a ziploc and shook to coat.

I am convinced that soaking the dried peas in the hot water for 1 hour (w/o seasonings) makes a HUGE difference. This soup is much smoother in consistency than any other split pea soup I have had or made.  I used chicken broth, more thyme as pinches can vary, no beef bouillon cuz I forgot, and a smoked butt. I have always used a stick blender at the end, that said, this soup blended up smoother, no kidding! My husband could not stop praising this soup. I'm so glad we have some leftover for lunch today.

After mixing this up, I just dumped it in a bowl with my chicken and coated it before putting it in a pan and topping with the remaining mayo mixture.  Cooked up perfectly in my convection oven set 50&#039; under temp, but running the full time in the recipe.  Thanks for sharing. UPDATE:  This is also fantastic on catfish.",5

Husband loved this and asked me to write down what I did so there is hope to make it again... If you hate when people do this - stop reading.  If you want ideas ... I cooked 1lb ground beef with a medium onion diced, 1 large seeded and deveined jalapeno.  I then added 7 tsp taco seasoning (recipe fr this site) and 3/4 C water.  Boiled a bit to get most of the water out and flavor in.  Then added a large can green chile&#039;s (6 oz?) and a mostly drained can of Rotel tomatoes and chile&#039;s.  I then added about 1/2 the bag of low fat cheese to the meat mixture - took it off the heat.  I used microwaved flour tortillas (about 10 sec 4 times - flipping and splitting the tortillas ea time) 1/2 the green enchilada sauce on bottom of pan (NOTE:  spray pan with EVOO or pam before beginning next time) and 1/2 can on top of enchiladas and then rest (1/2) of low fat cheese on the top.  Bake for 20 min and then add arugula and lf sour cream on top.",5

It didn&#039;t stay tented and the cheese ended up sticking to it.  When I uncovered the dish I got as much cheese off of the foil as I could and just set it back on top before putting it back in the oven.  The entire family enjoyed this.

I prepared this for last night&#039;s dinner, and had plenty to have again tonight.  I didn&#039;t use the rub to slow cook them in.  I used the barbeque sauce I was going to end with.  While baking in foil, I did include the rub ingredients in with the BBQ sauce.  Of course, by the time you have completed the cooking in the foil packets, you have essentially boiled the ribs anyway, and the rub/bbq sauce has permeated the meat.  I drained them after cooking, lined another pan with heavy duty aluminum foil anb proceeded under the broiler.  This really made the ribs.  They were tender, easy to separate to eat, and were just saucy enough to kinda make a mess.  I loved them!  And, I have a few left over to put into the freezer for another quick meal!

I gave this cooking method a try and was pleasantly surprised.  The low cooking temp made the majority of the interior stay nicely pink - medium rare - while the exterior was nicely crusty.  That&#039;s the way we like it.  I only let my roast sit out about 1 hour, so it was not quite room temperature, but I don&#039;t think that affected the outcome too much.  I seasoned my roast with a spice mixture called Essence (by Emeril).  I skipped putting anything except the garlic in the slits, being unsure about how to get the seasoning into the slits.  I think just salt and pepper would have been fine, but you could really use any seasoning you like.  I did use  low sodium beef broth and added the leftover broth plus onions into a jar of canned gravy, and it really made that a tasty addition to the meat.",5

I expected a lot from it, but to me it tastes exactly like it started as canned pork and beans. It is just too sweet. I used only half the brown sugar called for because we were worried that would be the case, but it is still way too sweet from the brown sugar, chili sauce( which is glorified ketchup), and tomato paste. If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the recipe for you. If you want a rich, authentic chile flavor, find a more traditional recipe that uses toasted and pureed chile peppers, which will have the flavor notes of coffee and beer. This recipe also makes a huge amount, much more than 6 or 8 servings, so now I have a freezer full of it. Sorry, but it doesn&#039;t work for me.",1

Also I will add canned chiles.  It was a decent recipe, just not a favorite in our household.  UPDATE: Made again 2/13/13 and used a 24 oz jar of Great Value Hot Salsa and stirred in cooked rice just before serving and this tasted much better.  Our family likes things a little spicy, so the hot salsa and the extra quantity really helped to make this something we can enjoy often.

I turned the heat up as indicated when I thought the meat would be almost done, but I had to increase the temp yet again, as it still didn&#039;t reach the correct internal temperature. So I upped it more and cooked another 20 minutes til it was done. I would try this again but start out with a higher temperature and see if I get a crispy skin.  I know you shouldn&#039;t eat the skin but let&#039;s face it, it is the best part.  Thanks for the recipe!",4

Where I had issues was the amount of filling.

I used raw lentils and boiled them for 45 minutes until they were soft enough, I chopped my oats in a small chopper so that they were smaller pieces as they were not instant oats and I was worried about them cooking properly. Finally I added grated carrot, celery and lots of parsley and a bit of ketchup. The result was absolutely delicious but my kids wouldn&#039;t touch it so I felt I couldn&#039;t give the recipe 5 stars no matter how much I wanted to.

I was wondering if the portions were spot on? Reason being that it serves 10-14 it says as of today and there is only one lb of pasta called for. I had to make another pound to serve that many but didn&#039;t need to make more sauce. So next time 2 lbs of spaghetti and this sauce as written. The slow simmer is great. The water is too much but I will likely do 1 cup or none next time. I simmered for 2.5-3 hours and there were watery plates. BUT it was so delicious. It got raves and raves.  You have a winner here.

I think the reason I didn&#039;t like it the first time I made it is that I had followed the instructions and cooked my garlic much too long..I suppose it burned, which gave the entire soup a bad taste.  This time I sauteed onion and carrots in extra virgin olive oil for about 5 minutes, THEN added the garlic and cooked only til the garlic was fragrant.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe using the beef broth and it turned out to be quite good, as well as quick, easy and very nutritious.   And the next day, it was even tastier.

I didn&#039;t realize my scale was off by an ounce so only used 7 ounces of pasta. We used Tillamook cheddar and real butter.

Thank you, we will be adding this to our menu!  UPDATE:  I have one child who requests this daily!!  But with the price of cheese I just can&#039;t do it. BUT we have had it about 3 times in a month as it is so easy and yummy.&lt;br/&gt;Update 5-3-13: you have to use REAL cheese. Not marble, not pre-shredded.. The preshredded stuff has rice flour added to it so it doesn&#039;t stick so your space will be grainy. Also, you need to cook your flour in the butter for a minute and then when you add your milk make sure to bring your sauce to almost a boil or even to a boil, then remove from heat and add your cheese then. This is NOT Kraft Mac and cheese, this is real food, dump and stir doesn&#039;t work. You do have to put some effort into it, but so worth it.&lt;br/&gt;We have used Tillamook cheddar, Tillamook white cheddar, cheap cheddar, sharp cheddar.. The key is CHEDDAR, and shred it yourself",5

I won&#039;t give it stars because I probably played around with the glaze too much. I sliced the berries thickly, and put maybe 2 1/2 cups into the pie. The glaze did seem too sweet, so I added some lemon without measuring. I only cooked the glaze with the one cup of hot water, then added an unmeasured amount of ice water before refrigerating, to thicken it before I poured it on the pie. I didn&#039;t use all of it on the pie, but it did seem like the pie was not full enough- of berries or glaze.&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ll keep looking for the perfect recipe...",0

First of all, they had to bake for 38 minutes before they were golden brown.  I ate one right away and kind of liked the flavored air. (Mine were not crumbly at all) But then after being cooled and bagged and left overnight, they are terribly sticky and not at all as predicted.   It was fun trying, though.  &lt;br/&gt;It&#039;s quite humid here due to lots and lots of rain this spring, so I wonder if that would make a difference.",0

Of course, that&#039;s depending on how the left overs are since this really isn&#039;t something my kids would be into so it&#039;s just two of us eating it.

I didn&#039;t think this was dry as others have stated, it was very creamy. I did add 1 (12 oz.) can of tuna, plus I added 1 tsp. garlic powder, 3 Tbsp. of parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup of sour cream, 1/2 tsp. each seasoned salt &amp; pepper, and a (2 oz.) jar of pimiento(s). I didn&#039;t have any celery or green peppers, so I added about (8 oz.) of slightly cooked peas &amp; carrots, as they were from a frozen bag. I did not add the 2 Tbsp. of butter to the noodles, cause I already added 1 Tbsp. of butter to the boiling water when I cooked the noodles. I topped the casserole with 15 (generic) ritz crackers, and topped the crushed crackers with 2 Tbsp. of melted butter. I think this dish would taste great using other canned soups, such as: cream of chicken with herbs, or cream of chicken &amp; mushroom soup. I plan on substituting other vegetables for the celery &amp; green peppers, such as: either corn or canned mushrooms. Thank you Carol for sharing this recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!",5

I don&#039;t usually make many cookies anymore. These were absolutely worth it. I must of made them a bit bigger because I only came out with 29 cookies, and I suppose that is why they took a few extra minutes in the oven. I too made my thumbprint in them again as soon as they came out of the oven. Made for a nicer indent for that delicious lemon filling. It was the perfect amount of lemony taste. This is definitely a make again recipe. Thanks so much for the recipe post Lavender Lynn.

Also I used a Melon ball scoop to get the right size and made 35 each time. But it definitely takes a good extra 5 minutes in the oven. I have to keep mine in for 15 minutes. So you just may want to watch this when you make them. I just did another batch this week to bring to work and they all raved about how delicious they were and they all want the recipe.

Well, no one needed it.  A basic but terrific lasagna.  UPDATE: When I made it tonight I altered it a little because my fridge/freezer went out and I needed to use things up. I probably used more of some ingredients than called for. My cottage cheese was low fat. I had about 1/4 of a green bell pepper, and a couple of slices of sweet onion that I diced and sauteed. I added them to some veggie crumbles I had left over and put them in the center layer of the lasagna.  It still made a great lasagna, everyone went back for seconds!

Don&#039;t over cook or cook until they look &quot;done.&quot; If you do that, it will end up like a very dry cake with all of your chocolate chips on the bottom somewhat dry and slightly burned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Instead, cook the brownies in a LARGE pan (they really rise from all those eggs!) until they no longer shake like jelly in the middle when you shake the pan. Once it&#039;s firm enough not to shake, leave them in another minute or two and then take them out! THEY WILL NOT LOOK DONE!

Roasted them in the over for an hour. I also made sure I used the pan drippings in the sauce. I sprinkled the leftover seasoning mix on the chicken after shredding. For the cheese in the filling, I crumbled queso fresco cheese, then used the cheddar / jack blend for the top (I mean really, why not have more cheese!). Other than that, I made as stated.

It was nice that we didn&#039;t need a lot of ingredients, and that she could mix it all with a spoon rather than having to dig out the mixer.  I helped her roll them into balls and then in the powdered sugar since that was a bit time consuming.  We got 2  large trays of cookies, totaling about 36 cookies.  Ours came out rather flat so next time I&#039;ll try making them a bit larger.

One 10 3/4 oz, can Campbell&#039;s Cream of Mushroom soup, one 10 oz. can of Rotel, 16 oz. chicken broth, and one pound of cooked chicken breast cut into bite-size pieces.  Yesterday was a typical summer day in Huntsville, Texas and I didn&#039;t want to turn the oven on.  I cooked the pasta in a six quart pan, drained it and added all of the other ingredients and put it on the stove top and cooked on low until everything was hot, bubbly and melted.  It was rather &quot;soupy&quot;, but I think it will thicken upon setting from the starch in the pasta.  If you want your version drier, use less broth.  I think a typical can of broth is about 14 1/2 ounces.  I purchase the 32 oz. cartons of broth.  I was extremely happy with the result!!!   This will probably be my usual method of assembling this unless I take it to a function.  One pan to wash made my day!  Miss Anita, thank you for your excellent recipe!

To be honest, I&#039;m not sure there was any difference between the baked ones and the nuked ones.  Regardless, they are so tasty, we completely cleaned the baking dish in one sitting.  I did think the onion taste was stronger than needed, so I&#039;ll only use the 1/2 cup green onions next time instead of the full 1 cup.

I reviewed this earlier and I remember being the 100th reviewer, but unfortunately it was never posted. Anyway hope that this review is posted. I used 5.7 lbs of boneless pork. It took about 6 hours for it to reach the stage where I could cut it in perfect slices. In the past when I baked it for about 8 hours, it was delicious too - perfect pulled pork (shredded easily). Both ways are great for sandwiches. However I am always baffled by the large quantities of pepper and mustard in the recipe. Thought it was a typo at first, but decided to use half the quantity for the size of pork I had. Thanks Mean Chef&lt;br/&gt;8/8/13 :I have to thank Bekah who has inherited this wonderful recipe.. This recipe is still a winner at our home. I have even made it with thick pork loin tips 3lbs in a covered pyrex dish. 375 degrees at 20 mins per pound - you&#039;re right .. it doesn&#039;t turn into pulled pork but delicious sliceable chunks of pork for sandwiches.

I get extremely annoyed at those members who post these horrible reviews and then don&#039;t even bother to complete their pages.  As far as I&#039;m concerned, they just &quot;hit and run&quot;.  This recipe was featured the other day and I saved it to try.  I have just now completed it and it is delicious!  The only change I made was to use a Mexican style blend cheese, because that&#039;s what I had.  It is not grainy, gritty or disgusting.  Remember, the  cheese you select to use will dictate the taste of the dish.  I have no burned flour taste.  I completely melted the butter, whisked in the flour, whisked in the milk and then kept whisking until it was thickened to my satisfaction.  I left it a bit runny, because the starch from the pasta will cause it to &quot;draw&quot; up.  Removed from the heat, stirred in the cheese until it was melted and creamy, then stirred in the elbows.  Pure mac and cheese heaven!  This is a classic recipe and not to be confused with a boxed mix or that made with Velveeta.  Velveeta isn&#039;t even classified as real cheese (and I still love it!).  Marie, thank you again for another wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper and I will use it often because it&#039;s such a fast meal.

Well, when I read the ingredients for the sauce DH said that it would be nice to try with codfish. OK, tried that and it was a hit.

I used a good flavour organic olive oil, fresh organic lemon, organic mountain oregano from Greece, organic fresh garlic clove, organic apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar for religious reasons, sea salt, to taste, a little more organic cane sugar because if my change of vinegar, romaine lettuce hearts, I left out the onion, no bell pepper, plus the rest of the ingredients.

I made two changes based on necessity, so I only had black pepper, and I cooked this chicken on a layer of baby carrots since I had no onion. I put the rub on the outside and cavity of the bird, as well as rubbing it under the skin on the breast, back, and thighs. The only sounds at dinner last night were &quot;mmmmm&quot;s, so thanks for sharing a great recipe. I&#039;ll try this in the rotisserie next time to crisp the skin up. Yum.",5

After making these, I still don&#039;t think boiling is a good idea. I used frenched chicken drumsticks (&quot;lollipops&quot;) instead of wings. The boiling step brought out what my husband called a &quot;smell&quot; that  prevented him from eating. I think it brought the marrow out of the bones or something. I am not sure if this is specific to the cut of meat, so I am not assigning stars. It would be about a 2 otherwise. I used half of the spice listed and Recipe #287041 instead of the sauce. I also think the oven time after boiling was a bit excessive. I did broil for 15 minutes on each side, but had to move the oven rack down after the first 15 minutes. The meat wasn&#039;t tasty. It was a bit too tough on the outside and tasted boiled on the inside. The spices that I added to the water did come through, so maybe I just need to brine the wings instead of boiling them.",0

While I am not a huge fan of the recipe as written, my family loves it with nacho cheese soup (2 cans) and golden mushroom soup. We also have run into the problem of it becoming runny, which we remedy with stirring in some sour cream before serving. I followed the advice of another reviewer and dusted the chicken with spices and browned it before adding it to the crock pot and it definitely perks up the flavor. Cook time usually runs around 5 to 5 1/2 hours. Any longer and the chicken tends to get that weird texture that is somewhere between boiled and dry. So based on rating this as soley a base recipe that someone can build on, I give it 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4). The original is lacking seasoning and not cheesy enough. Cook time is definitely way off, too.",4

The very last thing I did before simmering was add one bag of frozen Quorn tenders to replace the chicken.  I made the pico with fresh ingredients from the garden.  No one garnished their soup except DD who topped it with a dollop of sour cream.  We enjoyed the pico with tortilla chips on the side.

Glad you mentioned that the batter would be thin as it was and I was tempted to add more flour but didn&#039;t and a good thing as they puffed up so nice when cooking.  I even used your recommendation on the honey butter and enjoyed that.

Frosting: reduced powdered sugar to 2 c.; I didn&#039;t have quite enough vanilla extract so I put some vanilla beans in the frosting and it worked nicely. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing, this one is a definite keeper and worthy of the high ratings!&lt;br/&gt;Note: It did bake up well at the suggested temperature and really filled the 13 x 9 inch pan.",5

I got my squash from a local farmer&#039;s market - not sure how big it was - it took an hour to cook to soft.  I took the advice of others and sauteed a small onion and a half of a yellow bell pepper (both chopped) and then used Mexican flavored tomatoes instead of the recommended Rotel tomatoes/chilis (Mexican flavor has jalapenos and is a little spicier but a lot more flavorful).  First bite was OK, then took a second bite with a little salsa, then a third with a little salsa and a little sour cream and WOW was it delish!  Hubby went back for seconds!  We had it as a main dish but it would be great as a side to chicken too.  And then before we put it in the fridge and it was luke warm we each took one last bite and both immediately came to the conclusion that it is BEST that way (flavors just popped).  Will make it again.",5

Even with only doubling the other ingredients it was still very thin.  I thought it needed to be colder so I added 1 1/2 - 2 c of ice and blended that up.  My whole family enjoyed this for dessert.

I made a triple batch of these noodles to use for chicken and noodles.  I made the noodle recipe on Sunday morning and didn&#039;t cook them until Tuesday morning.  I rolled and cut out the dough and layered them in a rectangular plastic container with sheets of wax paper between each layer and then stored them in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook them.  I boiled two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in chicken broth until they were done, shredded them and stored them in the refrigerator too.  Two days later, I boiled a big pot of chicken broth (I think it was approximately 60 oz.) and dropped the noodles in one at a time.  Once all the noodles were cooked I added the shredded chicken.  Then I took a 4.5 oz packed of peppered gravy, mixed it with some of the chicken broth until it was smooth and added it to the chicken and noodles to thicken up the sauce.  I put it all in my 6 quart crock pot and set it on low for 2 hours.  I took the crock pot to work and set it on warm.  The chicken and noodles sat in the crock pot from 5:00 a.m until lunch time (12:00 p.m.).  About 1 1/2 - 2 hours before serving time I moved the temperature from warm to low to heat the noodles up more.  At this time I had to add water to the noodles because they were getting a little dry.  When it was time to serve the dishes, the noodles were perfect...they did not disintergrate and get mushy...they were soft but still had a &quot;bite&quot; to them.  Everyone raved about the noodles and they were all gone except for a thin layer at the bottom of the crock pot.  TIP:  Use a plastic crock pot liner to make clean up easier.  I am making the chicken and noodles again for my family&#039;s Thanksgiving feast.  This one is definitely goiing into my keeper file.  Thanks, kindcook, for an awesome recipe!",5

Next time I make it, I will break the spaghetti into smaller pieces, just to better mimic the original, not that it will make any difference in taste or anything. I attempted to make only half of this recipe and, as expected, ran into some issues with getting the rice and pasta done before the liquid evaporated. So, I just added more liquid a little bit at a time as the rice cooked. This seemed to work pretty well; but I managed to lose some of the chicken flavor in the process. I am very glad to be able to make this dish so much cheaper than buying it and am excited at the possibilities of what could be done with it. Thank you! UPDATE: I&#039;ve made this recipe several times since my first review. (These days, I usually season it with recipe #105993.) As much as I love the recipe, I kind of dread breaking up the spaghetti noodles. Since I prefer to break them almost as small as the rice, this can be a tedious process.

I wanted to prepare my gravy the day before Thanksgiving so I had no turkey drippings since I hadn&#039;t cooked my turkey yet.

I used 4 cups of organic no msg chicken stock and 4 cups of the water that I used to boil my gizzards in to make the gravy.  I removed the trimmings and gizzards before adding the broth to the rue.  Used a ton of white pepper and then took two gizzards and a laddle full of gravy and pureed them in the blender.  I then added that back to the gravy.

This is just a notation as I haven&#039;t yet made this yet. I read many of the reviews and noticed quite a few people stating that their broth was rather thick. One way, someone already mentioned by saying to drain and rinse the beans. The other way is to cook the pasta, drain and rinse it, THEN add it to the soup. It will have already given up it&#039;s starch, therefore it won&#039;t thicken up your broth.It&#039;s cold and rainy here in Las Vegas and this is going to be dinner! Hope this helps! Personally, I like my soup on the tick side, so I probably won&#039;t drain and rinse my pasta first, but will instead add a little chicken broth or stock to the soup either while still cooking or whenever I serve leftovers. Hope this helps!",0

It does take a bit of time to prepare, but it is worth it. We thought the amount of soy, hoisin and sauce was just perfect, and not sweet at all for us. I used ground turkey and halved it, so that I would have room for some veggies (a red bell pepper and mushrooms, as other reviewers did - the second time I also added water chestnuts). In addition, I at least doubled the ginger, used 1/4 tsp of the crushed red pepper and just drizzled the sesame oil over at the end (so used far less). It went perfectly with rice noodles, but I am sure it would also be great over rice. I bet tofu would work super in this too, if you are a vegetarian. Thanks for a fabulous meal!",5

Used poppy seeds on top as I like the looks of it.  Next time I will try toasted sesame seeds.  It had a slightly sweet taste that we love and the LOOKS of it is soooo pretty - can&#039;t believe I made something that looks and taste so great.

It avoided the sticky gooey bottom crust problem, while still giving you 2 crusts.  However, the amount of flour in the sauce thickened it to the point of making it disappear as sauce and turn into goo.  I highly recommend either increasing the liquid or reducing the thickening flour.  I think the flavoring could also be improved with some thyme and/or garlic.  It was pretty bland.

Time cooling also seemed to affect whether or not they held together...we had some angel wings and heads break off trying to get them off the pan :(  Overall, this was a simple and flavorful recipe - we used powdered sugar to roll out, and the dough was the perfect consistency.

Luckily we read the other reviewers because doubling the sauce is a must, Deep frying is not necessary, and the directions are terrible.&lt;br/&gt;Understand you must make the orange sauce first and keep it warm.  Then cut chicken &amp; place in bowl and to the cut chicken added the egg, salt, white pepper oil etc and then mix the chicken in that mixture. In seperate bowl add flour and cornstarch &amp; scoop one half of chicken mixture in flour cornstarch mixture coating all pieces. Heat oil in wok. Cook half the chicken until lightly browned. Remove from pan. Repeat cooking remainder of chicken. Then follow the rest of the recipe. Delish, we would give it ten stars. It was fresh, moist, tasty and authentic American Chinese. If you would have said it was Panda Express I would have believed it and said that they had just made it fresh. A keeper even if it is labor intensive and used most of the dishes in the house.

I have never made cinnamon rolls before, as was so nervous to mess them up, but honestly they are sooo easy!  I made the dough in the bread maker, warming the milk slightly to about 85 degrees (30 seconds in the microwave).  The dough was a little sticky when I was working with it, so I just made sure to use plenty of flour so it didn&#039;t stick.  On one batch, I made the log and then refrigerated overnight and on the other I baked right away...both turned out great!  I frosted when they were slightly cool so that the icing didn&#039;t melt.

I bought a great five pound prime rib (2 ribs serving 4 people) from my local butcher.  Pretty pricey, but so worth it. Instead of inserting cloves of garlic into the meat the night before (I totally forgot), I heated up 2 tbsps of extra virgin olive oil along with six cloves of garlic (with skin), once the oil was infused with the garlic (you will smell the garlic/do not let it burn), I bumped up the heat, and seared three sides of the meat (couldn&#039;t do four since, it was all bone) and let all sides get crispy.  Let it crisp up, do not move it too much, once you see a thin layer of shinniness on the seared side, you know its ready to flip. The rest of the recipe was followed to a T.  Very flavorful, served it with Ina Garten&#039;s horseradish sauce (which I will be posting shortly). Thank you Kittencal for yet another great recipe.",5

The garlic was a sharp flavor in this and was a little potent despite picking normal sized cloves so don&#039;t use big ones. The foil lined pan is a MUST! We doubled the sauce and still it doesn&#039;t adhere or remain on the chicken fully. The meat was juicy and moist however. The outside of the chicken was tougher and was where the flavor was.

Taking the advice of a couple other reviewers, I used Crisco and flour and heavily coated my pan.  I also left it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, and probably could have left it another five or so.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  I would like to suggest that those that had issues used too much flour.  You must fluff the flour and then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup and lightly level off.  If you use the dipping method, you will end up with too much flour.  Also, in my experience, you cannot over beat the fats.  If your butter starts to separate, throw it out and start all over.  Pound cakes are tricky and I think these are the two main causes of failure.  This is extremely high fat.  If you worry about fat calories and grams, this would not be the recipe for you!

Then added 1/4 cup chopped italian parsley and salt and pepper.  Added about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup dry white wine.  Needed a bit more flavor for our taste, so I added 1 tsp. of thyme and two packets of Swanson&#039;s Flavor boost, chicken flavor.  Added the rotisserie chicken pieces then and poured all into a Pam sprayed 9x12 casserole dish.

I also accidentally used a different mix--brown gravy mix as opposed to the onion, but it tasted wonderful nonetheless. I&#039;ve made recipes combining cream of mushroom soup with onion soup mix, and I think I like this one better! The gravy had wonderful flavor, and the cube steaks were very tender. I did do a few things differently--I browned the steaks in a large skillet with some sliced fresh mushrooms, foregoing the crock pot only because I had lots of dishes already, and didn&#039;t want to make more. Lol  While they were browning, I combined the soup with the gravy mix and water, and upon noticing it wasn&#039;t onion gravy, added a few tablespoons of dried minced onions. When the steaks were browned, I poured the gravy mixture into the skillet, covered it, set it to &quot;simmer&quot;, and then let it do its thing for about 2 hours. The result was yummy! I also only had a pound of cube steaks, but prepared and used the entire amount of gravy. (Recommended.) Or, if you do have the two pounds, you may want to double the sauce if you&#039;re serving with mashed potatoes, noodles, dumplings, or fries, etc. I served ours with American cheese and potato pierogies, ladling the luscious gravy over all. But we could have used even more, since as it cooks, the gravy tends to thicken, and reduce to some extent. Next time I&#039;ll try it with the onion gravy mix, and transfer the cube steaks to the crock pot. Thank you Southern Chef, for sharing your recipe! This is a definite keeper!",5

I made a whole recipe, but used 2 whole small jalapenos and Hot Shot seasoning instead of the Ancho Chile Pepper Seasoning.  These were slightly spicy, but not bad, even my three year old ate some. Also, February in Pennsylvania is not grilling weather and the broiling thing scared me a little, so I made these in a frying pan set on medium-low temp and let them cook for 6 minutes per side and used the recommendation to only flip them once then I finished them off by placing two slices of bacon and then the shredded cheddar and placing them under the broiler for 2 minutes to melt the cheese.  Served them alongside garlic fries for a great Super Bowl dinner.  These are sure to be made again in the summer!  Thanks Julesong.",5

Easy to throw together and tastes divine. We used butter (1cup) for taste as we dislike margarine. It was a good substitution. We used hotdog buns for the bread and the spread and it was terrific. You need some sort of bread with thickness or a crust because the spread it heavy and could get soggy. The rolls, french bread, crusty bread, buns etc make the bottoms not burn due to being a thicker bread. We served it with spaghetti, meatballs and salad and felt the bread&#039;s taste was just as good or much better as premade garlic bread sold in stores. It was identical to garlic cheese bread we have had at restaurants too. The cheddar makes it kid friendy too. We will make again and again because it is so good.

If I were to make again using 4 chicken breasts, I would suggest adding 2 more tablespoons of the brown sugar. I baked this for 30 minutes in a 400&ordm; oven, but the chicken was a bit dry, so next time I&#039;ll reduce the baking time to 25 minutes. I can&#039;t see baking the chicken at a higher temp, not if you want burnt, dried-out chicken. I ended up dipping the chicken in a honey mustard sauce which I got from Hardees (hamburger restaurant), and boy did it make the chicken taste even better!

I had previously been unsuccessful in finding a cinnamon roll recipe that didn&#039;t have eggs (that I felt compelled to make).  I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.

The flavor to me was just okay.  The cayenne was barely noticeable.  I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d make this again but if I do, I&#039;d have to bump up the seasoning and/or serve it with a dipping sauce.

I used chicken italian sausage cut into chunks and only made 1/2 a recipe since there are only 3 of us.  I am wishing now that I would have made the whole amount because it is so good.  I found that the amount of water was fine as it needed to be thinned quite a bit.  I simmered for about an hour and then let it sit on the stove for a few hours before serving.

The chops turned out dry and the gravy was really thin so I thickened that up with a slurry of cornstarch. The total cook time listed is way off.  If you cook for the full time listed in the recipe, it should be closer to one hour 30 minutes (add another 10 minutes for prep) so I don&#039;t know where the 2 1/2 hrs comes from which is listed at the top of the recipe. All in all though, the flavour is good so by reducing the cooking time and thickening the gravy, I would probably try this again. Thank you for posting!",3

For one thing, the time to make - 28 minutes is a complete fallacy.  The recipe says to add all the ingredients and brown the potatoes - it doesn&#039;t give any clue of how long it will take, but I can tell you that I saut&eacute;ed the potatoes for over 10 minutes, and they still were not brown.  At this point, I was up to 15-20 minutes of prep (all the chopping) and cook time.  I added the other ingredients (I used chicken stock as some other reviewers suggested, unfortunately, I did not read the review that said the recipe had too much liquid, and I added a hole can - 14oz - of stock).  It then took another 5 minutes to bring to a boil.  I set the timer for 5 minutes so I could uncover and stir.  When I checked after 5 minutes, now down to low, it didn&#039;t seem like the potatoes would cook.  After 10 minutes,  turned the heat back up.  When the 20 minutes were done, the potatoes had finally softened (I used red bliss), but, there was a lot of liquid left so I left the lid off and let it simmer another 10 minutes.  If you are keeping track, we are up to 55 minutes.  I finally added the cheese, and that seemed to make the liquid into more of a sauce, and the result was pretty good - very tasty, it reminded me of sausage and peppers that I make, and I ended up sopping up some of the gravy with bread - so very carb heavy meal.  I wish I could figure out a good vegetable to have with it (besides a salad).",3

The 4 cups of rhubarb only filled  the 8x8 pan 1/4 of the way up the side in it&#039;s raw state. Once cooked there would have been maybe 1/2 an inch of filling. I went and cut 4 more stalks which gave me close to 7 cups and raised the rhubarb level to about 2/3 up the side of the pan and, of course, I need to increase the other ingredients that went into the filling. Also not mentioned in the recipe is a sitting time (30 mins for me) to allow the sugar (I used a sugar - Splenda mix -1/4 sugar to 3/4 Splenda) to draw out the juice. That&#039;s important because it keeps the filling from being dry and the thickened juice is an excellent part of a crisp. There is also way to much sugar in the topping for us so I used 1/4 cup Splenda Brown and 1/4 cup Splenda. I use Splenda because I&#039;m diabetic but it measures and sweetens exactly like sugar and I would use the same changes if I were using sugar. With more rhubarb and less sweetner this make a dessert that we well enjoyed.",2

After 17 minutes in the oven, they were picture perfect brown on top.  The bottoms were perfect too.  When I sliced them open I was amazed at the texture &amp; fragrance.

Once we got through all that, we got delicious, rich, moist-to-the-bone-and-crunchy-outside gen-you-wine fried chicken and at the risk of repeating, loved it.",5

I marinated the beef in the sauce mixture using all regular soya and skipped the dredging process.  I made a second batch of sauce using teriyaki sauce.

This came out so close to what we usually order at our little Chinese restaurant.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I&#039;ve made other breads before but this was my very first raisin bread and it was definitely a success! I did add wheat gluten to my flour (about a rounded teaspoon per cup of flour) which helped the bread have a nice rise. I also followed other suggestions and soaked my raisins first in some hot water (I personally found 3/4 cup was a good amount of raisins but will probably throw in an extra handful or two next time just because I love raisins!) Then I let the same water cool a bit and used that for the water in the recipe. I also added the raisins directly into the liquids before adding the dry ingredients and my bread machine had no issues mixing the raisins into the dough (and my raisins stayed intact through the process!) I also used brown sugar instead of regular white sugar, cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon (as I used salted butter) used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and left everything else the same. Usually I will cut my dough in half and bake them as 2 loaves, but this time I decided to just have one big loaf and ended up with a REALLY big, really fluffy and really tasty loaf of raisin bread!

Mine has more flavorings and less fat.  It is not posted here but includes a bay leaf, paprika, onion, and regular milk instead of cream and milk.  I think the raw flour taste in this is a reasonable critique.  I felt this did have some raw notes.  I&#039;m not sure if it is because I didn&#039;t simmer the sauce long enough or if the roux was the problem.  I did cook the flour in the butter a bit more than the usual amount for a white sauce, but maybe it was not long enough.  So, be sure to cook the flour in the butter a long time (longer than usual).   I also used panko bread crumbs, which I think was a mistake.  Regular bread crumbs would have been better in my opinion - just goes to show you that the recipe means what it says.  The panko texture was just too crispy and distracted from the gooey goodness of the macaroni although the taste was unaffected.",4

I also used 1 10 oz can of baby clams, 1 6.5 oz can of chopped clams, and 1 6.5 oz can of minced clams. I cut back to two Russet potatoes (plenty!), minced two ribs of celery that I cooked with the onion, and then used cream of potato soup.

The first time I made it I used the Sweet Baby Ray Barbecue Sauce and found it just a bit bland. But then the second time I made it with Jack Daniels Barbecue Sauce, and it was fantastic.

Also, the second time I had to use what was labelled a 4-lb center-cut port roast; I&#039;m assuming this means it&#039;s a shoulder cut but I&#039;m not sure.

I used quite a bit more powdered sugar (probably at least half a cup) because I didn&#039;t want them to stick to each other.  I already tasted one and it was very good.

I baked mine on a foil lined tin and wont use foil next time. The edges were nice and crisp, but the center was still a little soft . It&#039;s not pizza crust, but with the toppings it has all the flavors and you can eat it like pizza. I love that I didn&#039;t feel grossly full after eating three slices.

So, I decided to try this recipe.  I doubled it because I was bringing it to a pot luck and because I bought the large tub of marscapone.  I also didn&#039;t know what caster sugar was, but going on one of the reviews, I used powdered sugar - and it worked fine.  I also only made the 2 cups of coffee, but I used about 1/4 cup.  I can&#039;t imagine using so much liquid in the recipe.  I very quickly dipped the lady fingers so that they were barely wet with the coffee.  The recipe came out excellent.  I think tiramisu is all about ingredients (use marscapone, good lady fingers, and good liqueur - I used Kahlua and brandy) AND technique - the whipping of egg whites and folding, and not soaking the lady fingers are key to a good tiramisu.  My original recipe called for some of the coffee/liqueur mixture in the marcapone mixture - I&#039;m not sure if this recipe needs it or not, but it wouldn&#039;t hurt either.  I will definitely make this again - it will be my new standard.",5

My daughters thought these waffles tasted like regular pancakes. The measurements in this recipe seem off--it calls for a lot of baking powder, a lot of butter, and the flour-to-milk ratio also seems off, resulting in a very thin batter.

You can easily add blueberries, chocolate chips, cinnamon, etc. I doubled the recipe because cleaning the waffle iron is such a chore, and then I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and three teaspoons of vanilla. That yielded 14 fluffy waffles and I think the added cinnamon and extra vanilla gave the waffles an added flavor that we would have missed if omitted. To make the waffles extra fluffy, I poured the batter into the waffle iron and left the lid up for a minute so the bottom portion of the waffle could rise. I then closed the lid and let the entire waffle cook through. My family and I ate five of the waffles for breakfast and I froze the rest.

I don&#039;t know what it is about this type of fish that eludes me, but I&#039;ve learned to steer clear of salmon because, although I love it, I botch salmon recipes time and again. The fish market had a sale on wild-caught salmon, so I picked up a fillet. I don&#039;t like baking salmon because of the way it makes the house smell, so I looked up a grilled salmon recipe on good ol&#039; Food.com/ex-Recipezaar.com and found this recipe. It was so, so simple to grill this salmon this way and make it taste delicious. I started by patting the salmon dry with paper towels. I don&#039;t know if this removes some of the &quot;fishiness&quot; that cooked salmon tends to end up with, but it has made salmon less fishy-tasting for us in the past. I coated the fillet with olive oil on either side, added salt and pepper to taste, and then grilled for 6 minutes per side over medium-high heat for an average-sized salmon fillet. That&#039;s all I did and the salmon tasted great before I even added this wonderful sauce. 

The sauce is involved, with many ingredients, but utterly worth it. This sauce made the salmon taste even better. I will say that I used orange juice instead of pineapple, a dash of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne, and I used half the amount of sugar listed in the recipe. The sauce was sweet enough and would&#039;ve been too sweet if I had used the full amount of sugar, and too spicy had I used the cayenne pepper. I made double the amount of sauce and have frozen it in batches to use on future fish or chicken dishes. Thanks for making me less scared of cooking salmon! Be well.",5

The sauce was the height of velvet deliciousness, and there was plenty of sauce.    I used lowfat milk, full-fat cheddar and real butter.    I took the perfectionist route and sprinkled in the flour (not having Wondra on hand), and I couldn&#039;t believe the texture.   I did have to add a little flour because I lost some to my fingers and countertop while sprinkling.   NEVER have I had a better texture in a cheese sauce.  NOTES FOR SUCCESS:   The flour needs to be added very slowly, stirring all the while.   It will clump if added quickly.   Just resign yourself to the zen of it, and enjoy creating a masterpiece.   The flour mixture needs to be cooked long enough for it to thicken.  If you&#039;ve never made a roux or white sauce, try to find a video online.   That cooks out the flour taste and is also what thickens the sauce.   The cheese should not be packaged, pre-grated cheese.   The latter is coated with something to keep the strands separate, and it WILL effect the final outcome.   Lastly, if your heat is low enough, the cheese can be added in only two or three batches as long as you&#039;re constantly stirring.",5

Unfortunately I only had 2 lbs. of chicken on hand to use in this recipe, and after my husband and I ate the 2 lbs., I wished I&#039;d of had the 3 lbs. of chicken. When I was mixing the ingredients, I used a low sodium soy sauce which I purchased at Festival Foods. The brand was Essential Everyday, and it only had 580 mg of sodium in it. I didn&#039;t add any salt, but I did use 2 cloves of garlic (minced). I did lightly grease the baking pan, before adding the chicken and the sauce, and I baked the chicken for 30 minutes, then flipped it over, and continued baking for another 30 minutes. And it was perfectly done and caramelized within the hour. I would bake as per the instructions, but just be sure to turn the chicken over after the first 30 minutes of baking.

131018,pulled pork  crock pot,26,4,1110,335.1,10.0,72.0,24.0,80.0,10.0,8.0,51931,2015-11-29,"I am reviewing the recipe two ways.  One as written and one with a variation suggested by Doug MC.  Both reviews are for the pulled pork itself and its juices, not the pulled pork with the BBQ sauce since that would be totally subjective based on the type and brand of sauce preferred by each chef and a not good review of the recipe itself.  Also, I made the variation one first as I forgot the ginger ale, but had apples and apple cider vinegar on hand.

&quot;As Is&quot;  - 4 Stars:  Prepared as directed.  It was good and had I made this BEFORE the variation, I would have given it 5 stars as I&#039;ve never made pulled pork and wouldn&#039;t know any different.  The recipe was easy and delicious, but lacked some flavor and didn&#039;t WOW me like the variation recipe.  I used Pork Shoulder Butt (that&#039;s what the packaging said that I purchased from Kroger).  I couldn&#039;t find a 4 pound roast so I bought an 8 pounder and doubled the recipe.  I&#039;m not sure what flavoring the ginger ale gave it, but I couldn&#039;t taste it.  I cooked on low for 11 hours and the meat shredded easily, was super tender and juicy.  Like the variation recipe, we also took out the onions after cooking/shredding.  Also, we did not add the BBQ sauce to the meat and simmer in the crockpot.  Instead, I put the shredded pork back in the crockpot with its juices and let it soak it up on Warm.  Adding BBQ sauce to the meat and simmering is just not how my husband eats it in the south.  Plus, if I had eaten it using my husband?s sauce mixed throughout, I would have given it 2 stars.  I don?t like his sauce.  LOL.  Served for Thanksgiving Dinner with mashed potatoes, gravy from the pulled pork juices, and roasted asparagus.  My husband definitely gives this a thumbs up and likes it so this is a keeper.

&quot;Variation&quot; -  5 Stars:  Instead of the ginger ale, I wanted to try Doug?s recommendation of 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup apple cider since I had that on hand ? did not have smoke flavor and did not use it.  Everything else in the  original recipe stayed the same.  I have a juicer so I juiced a Granny Smith apple for fresh apple juice.  I also used Braggs Organic Apple Cider.  I Poured in 1 cup of each.  I put mine in the crockpot when I left for work around 6:30 am with onions on top and on the bottom.  By time I came home at 4:30 pm, the meat was falling off the bone.  I turned it off and pulled the pork with a fork.  It was so tender and juicy.  I couldn?t help myself and ate some without the BBQ Sauce.  It had a nice tang to it?.maybe the vinegar did that, I don?t know or the apples, but it had a different flavor than just the ginger ale recipe.  It was still amazing.  I gave some to my husband, but he didn?t like the onions because ?that?s not how they do it in the south where he?s from?, so I removed the onions and put the meat back in the crockpot and into the juices.  Since he is from the South and usually is served his pulled pork plain with the sauce on the side so he can pour it over the meat on his sandwich, that is exactly how I served it for dinner.   I heated the BBQ Sauce.  He used Famous Dave?s Devils Spit Sauce.  He has always HATED everything I have ever cooked in the crockpot so he wasn?t hopeful that it would be good.  On the contrary, he LOVED IT!!!!  Instead of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner this year, he asked for pulled pork ? MADE IN THE CROCKPOT!  Excellent variation to the original recipe.  Will definitely will be making this again.",5

I had, on hand, Pampered Chef Smoky BBQ Rub which included the same rub ingredients mentioned here and I added that generously to each side of ribs.  I wrapped in the foil and refrigerated for about 3 hours. Pulled them out of fridge, sprinkled on some Liquid Smoke and added some sea salt and baked them at 300 degrees for about 2 hours 15 minutes.  Pulled out (very tender and falling off bone) and basted on Baby Ray&#039;s BBQ sauce (our fav too) and broiled as directed to get the sauce nicely caramelized.  We used forks, as my ribs were country style and not a rack; but it was tender and flavorful.  My son is not one to go looking for leftovers the next day but did with these ribs and luckily I had a few leftover.  I served this with a cheesy potato casserole and some green beans.

Then my trusty rice cooker that had been with me for over a decade broke. Money is tight so I decided to try and make rice on the stove for the first time. As in, in my life. I tried using the same rice-to-water ratio in a pot that I had used for my rice cooker. The rice came out sticky--too much water. Then I tried Martha Stewart&#039;s recipe. The rice came out dry--too little water. (I have little luck with Martha Stewart recipes. I should have known better.) And then I tried your recipe. Perfect rice! My husband and kids said they didn&#039;t notice any difference between this rice and the rice cooker rice I had been making for so long. Thank you for saving me the expense of buying a new rice cooker! *Note: my husband is lactose-intolerant, so I coat the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of olive oil and skip the butter.

I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t reviewed it yet for as often as I make it.  I use 2 cups of puffed rice cereal (not Rice Krispies, but the plain ol&#039; puffed rice with a single ingredient of brown rice), 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and sometimes molasses instead of corn syrup.  Sometimes I use almond butter instead of peanut butter, so it could be made quite allergy-friendly.  As recommended, I mix everything except the mini chocolate chips (I tried full-size, and mini are better), let it cool slightly, then add the mini chips.  Oh yum yum yum!  It&#039;s still quite sweet, so I&#039;ve been playing with it, and I can replace some of the syrup/molasses with water with acceptable results.

The trick to good results is to PRESS the bars into the pan.  PRESS HARD.  The less air, the more likely it is to stay in bar form!  I use a piece of waxed paper to keep my hands (or lid) clean while pressing.  Next I pop the pan in the freezer to make the bars easier to slice.  I usually slice into 12 bars instead of 16 (too yummy to skimp) and wrap each one with press-n-seal (I&#039;ve been happiest with that for this).  Then I store the bars in the freezer until I need a snack.  And when I remember I have these in the freezer, I can feel the need to snack building up!  At least it&#039;s healthier (and cheaper) than so many other snack choices.

I&#039;m a huge fan of recipes that are flexible, meaning they can be used as a starting point to make something different.  Other dried fruit, nuts, coconut ... just imagine this with chopped almonds and coconut instead of raisins!  I&#039;m sure that would be awesome too!  This is the best kind of flexible recipe because I only measure the dry ingredients (fewer dishes to wash, and I just rinse after dry stuff), and I get good results eyeballing the sticky stuff.",5

My family had this for a Cinco de Mayo/Supermoon party this year and it was a hit.  Like another reviewer said, they were sold on trying this by the story that went with it.  Loved it!!  I read somewhere that if you put the avocado pit in with the guacamole that it also helps it from turning brown along with the plastic wrap trick on laying it right on the dip.  I put a couple in and the next day it was still beautifully green.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!
UPDATE March 4, 2016: I found a new way to keep it fresh and green looking. When ready to store, forget the pit and plastic wrap technique. Instead, push down guacamole to get all the air out and smooth top. Add about 1/2&quot; of LUKEWARM water and close with a tight fitting lid. Sounds weird but it works. On the 3rd day it was still green. Do this every time you get out and use.",5

I also used 14 ounces of Ginger Ale, and cooked the roast over night for 12 hours on LOW, but by the next morning, the roast was far from being done, so I turned the roast over, covered it, and cooked on HIGH for another 2 hours. By then the roast was done. I cut the meat into bite size pieces, rather than shredding with 2 forks, and just added a few of the cooked onions back in with the meat, and discarded the remaining onions. Since there was lots of meat, I added an entire (28-ounce) bottle of Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s Original Barbecue Sauce. (Next time I&#039;m going to use Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s Sweet &amp; Spicy Barbecue Sauce, cause we like spicy.) After I added the barbecue sauce, I cooked for about 1-1/2 hours on LOW, so not to dry out the meat. I have noticed, when you cook meat on a LOW setting before serving, it never does get hot enough &#039;temp-wise&#039;, and so the meat was just warm, and not hot enough, but we still enjoyed the sandwiches. I&#039;m reheating leftovers in the microwave. Since I used a bigger roast, I found this made at least 15-16 sandwiches. One thing I did want to mention when making this recipe, I used a 6-quart crock-pot which only has 3 settings, On, LOW, and HIGH.

I boiled down the sauce and stirred the chicken in the sauce frequently. That worked out well, as the chicken pieces absorbed some of the sauce and were fork-tender when done.

(Leftovers made for great tiny sandwiches!) The first time I used all vegetable oil and the rolls were nice and soft but lacking that nice buttery flavour. The second time I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup butter (melted) and that woke the rolls right up. I much prefer it with some butter in the dough. Next time I may try subbing all the oil for butter, but I really liked it with half butter, half oil! I also like this method of mixing half the flour first and then the rest as it needs it. This made it a lot easier for me to mix than just throwing all the flour in all at once. I let the dough have a full first rise (it took only maybe 40 minutes because my ingredients were warmer than lukewarm; so my dough rose quickly!) and I ended up making 32 rolls! So many rolls! They turned out so soft and delicious, and perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner. It made me smile seeing people keep reaching for them! And they're still soft and delicious the next day. Thank you!",5

I'd never tried biscuits before, as being from Australia, they are not a common thing. We do have the similar but sweet British scones, which are served with jam and cream. I used the food processor like the author, and found it to be easy. I did find the wet dough hard to work with as it kept sticking to my hands. I'd be grateful for any tips on this. I was also not sure if you are supposed to flatten the dough again between each fold. Like another reviewer stated, the ones I pieced together from the leftover dough turned out better than the first ones, which makes me think that a little kneading may be ok. I may have flattened the dough a little too much before cutting because mine weren't super tall. This may have partly been due to the cutter I used which was a Tupperware double sided one, where it has two different sized circles on each side. I used the bigger side, but it probably pressed the cut rounds down too much. I know an old trick with scones is to actually use a small drinking glass to cut the rounds and keep them nice and high. Mine cooked a little too fast, which I was prepared for as my oven runs hot. The taste was buttery and savoury, which was strange being used to sweet scones, but not unpleasant.

I did add what I estimated to be an extra teaspoon of vanilla as well as a cup of mini chocolate chips that I had tossed in a little flour so they wouldn't sink. The kids helped from beginning to end with measuring and mixing. It made exactly 24 cupcakes and needed 21 minutes in their oven. The cupcakes rose beautifully, the tasted great, and were moist.

The meatballs, which were mixed and rolled with the help of my 7 year old son (he had a ball) came out perfectly, flavourful and tender. I followed the recipe to a tee and served them with spaghetti. I don't know why some commenters are so worried about broiling or cooking the meatballs first. You don't need to, it's just a waste of valuable time. Mine stayed together just fine. The trick, I think is to make the meatballs first and let them sit for a bit while you start the sauce so the breadcrumbs can absorb the egg and juices which in my opinion helps bind them together. Also, just gently drop each ball into the sauce and don't stir for a while until they are cooked. The raw meatballs, as I read in another comment are also supposed to help flavour the sauce as they cook. I can certainly agree with that.

I read that cookies put in fridge bake better - and due to timing left in fridge overnight. When I baked them cold - they STUCK to the pan - so need to use parchment if you are going to cool the dough. They were not flat - did not spread and were thicker and chewier due to the cold dough. (which we like). UPDATE: I've made these about 8 times now - and use all the sugar all the time... I've begun to soak and plump my craisins too-- thanks for that suggestion! Everyone LOVES these cookies!!! I used my cookie scooper and had no trouble with flattening cookies or too plump cookies. I got 28 cookies and 12 minutes was a good time - except after the cookie sheets were hot - the second round in the oven (last few cookies) got a bit overdone - probably should reduce a minute or two if using the cookie sheets a second time... UPDATE to the UPDATE - Turn down the oven a bit and cook them a bit longer so the butter doesn't melt and spread out and make flat / ugly cookies....,5

I'm going to list my changes based on our family's dietary needs in case it's helpful. We added more carrot (an extra cup) and I ran it through the food processor rather than shred it. We then partially saut&eacute;ed the carrots with the onion as we wanted them to be done. We also used frozen broccoli florets as some of the reviewers said the fresh wasn't cooked through. This worked great and we will do it again!! Also, we used dairy free butter and cashew milk (in place of both the cream and milk). We also used gluten free flour and upped it to 1/2 cup and added in an extra couple tablespoons of butter, since other reviewers have said it was too thin. Our soup turned out thick and creamy. The flavor was excellent, and I loved the addition of carrot (who can complain about adding more veggies?! ;). This will be a regular on our dinner rotation.",5

I used oregano instead of marjoram (bc it's what I had in the spice rack) and olive oil in place of butter (bc of a lactose allergy).

I am giving 5 stars because the beauty of this recipe is its versatility--I have used cashew butter, chocolate chips, and dried cherries together, almond butter with chocolate chips and mint extract, and peanut butter with chocolate chips and crushed pretzels. I always use old fashioned oats pulsed in my coffee grinder a bit, and I often use a mixture of rice crispy cereal and plain cheerios (those cereals that languish in the pantry toward the end of the box LOL). You can totally make these in the microwave; I mix the nut butter, honey, and about 1/4 sugar and microwave for about 45 seconds, stir, then pop it back in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Easy peasy and dangerously quick! The only major tweak I make every time is one I highly recommend--if you use natural nut butters, add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the dry ingredients.

It is a great starter recipe you can easily customize to anyone's tastes. My kids tend to prefer blander foods that don't have too many ingredients so I make it pretty much according to the recipe, but I am able to add green olives, chopped grilled eggplant, etc. to mine.

It was a bit on the small side, so I cut back on the seasonings a little bit, but I didn't need to. I could have taken all of it and still not been too salty, thanks to the salt being kosher salt. At first, when the crock pot heated up, it smelled like heaven, then, when it got closer to the 8 hour time, it started to smell like maybe it was starting to burn or something akin to that, but all was well when I took it out. I did cook it on the low heat setting, so shouldn't have worried. In fact, I highly recommend using the low setting and refrigerating it overnight, so you can remove the fat from the drippings (assuming you plan to add them back to the meat.) There was LOT of fat left in the juices. The taste of this was simply wonderful, but you could easily mix it up with different flavors and have it come out great. I'll use this meat for sandwiches, burritos, even omelets or fritattas. It would be good over rice or potatoes as well.

I also tried to read as many reviews as possible! I used a full stick of butter (1/2 cup), and used 2 eggs. I reduced the ginger to 2 tsp as well. I didn't let the dough sit just so I could see how it worked and just in case I am pressed for time in the future. Seemed to work out just fine. I used LOTS of flour and rolled the dough on a Silpat. I also rolled the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness. I didn't have gingerbread men---only a big heart shaped one. I baked mine for 350 for 9 minutes. My spouse said they were great. I look forward to using the gingerbread man cutout.",5

I used jumbo muffin pans and so baked them for 22 minutes at 350. I didn't get to taste them myself as they were for a friend but they looked and smelled as they should. If I get any feedback from her I'll pass it on.,5

Instead of chopping the onions by hand, I put them in the food processor. I think this caused more liquid to be released, so my batter was a little thin. If you do use the food processor, I would recommend draining the onions first before adding to batter.",4

I assumed my batter may be on the thin side because of this. However, the batter was very thick. I was tempted to add more liquid, but decided to attempt it as is. They were so thick that I was afraid they wouldn't cook through. I cooked them at a lower temperature so the outside wouldn't get done before the inside. They turned out fine, very thick and fluffy. It made eight very filling pancakes.",4

Using the bread machine made it easy and the results - Wow!! I did brush mine before baking with an egg white and top with toasted sesame seeds, the inside of these came out pillowy soft, but still firm enough to stand up to all our hamburger fixings. As I said, NEVER buy store bought again",5

The batter was really thin and the texture was softer than we like. They get mushy before you can eat them once you add syrup. The flavor was fine. Next time I will play with the ingredient measurements and see if I can get them closer to a traditional waffle.,3
