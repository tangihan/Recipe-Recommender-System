I spoke with MsTart prior to making this recipe as I wanted to try making it gluten-free. I used the following: 1 cup brown rice flour, 1 cup white rice flour, 1 cup potato flour, and 3 1/2 cups GF baking flour. I also added 2 teaspoons xanthum gum, and the other ingredients as written. The dough came out nicely and I made 1 loaf after th initial prove. It was rather small (about 6 inches long/4 inches wide) and I baked using the boiling hot water in the preheated oven. The loaf had a wonderful crust but was not done inside ~ still doughy. I did taste test it and the flavor was good, it just wasn't done. I will make another loaf tomorrow, cutting the temperature to 400 and not kneading as much. I'm convinced this is the perfect recipe for my gluten-free bread craving, I just have to figure out what the adjustments are that I need to make. I've never baked any kind of bread other than quick-bread (cake-like) breads, so this is ALL new to me. Will update this review tomorrow.

63712,the ultimate lemon meringue pie,39,15,100,476.3,33.0,165.0,10.0,12.0,52.0,21.0,352538,2010-05-31,"Sorry, but this just didn't work for me.  The crust was good, the meringue lovely (I used all 6 egg whites and adjusted the sugar etc to compensate).  The problem was with the ingredients and method of making the filling, I think.  I have only made LMP a few times and always used a recipe that had a lemon curd type of filling.  Never a problem with runny filling or flavourless filling.  Due to the rave reviews I thought I'd try this to see what I was missing.  My first question was about adding so much water to the filling ingredients.  I noticed many LMP recipes use a water and cornstarch based filling which seems to provide much less flavour than one using mostly or all lemon juice for the filling.  I also didn't understand adding unbeaten egg yolks to all that sugar and cornstarch.  That seems like asking for trouble along the lines of little bits of tough egg floating in the filling.  Why not combine the water and beaten egg yolks or even a little water and egg yolks?  Or add some of the cold water to the sugar and cornstarch, then add the rest to the yolks and combine?  It would prevent egg lumps that one reviewer said she dealt with by using an immersion blender.  Then the cooking instructions seem backwards.  They say to cook the sugar, cornstarch, yolks and water ""until thickened"", then add the lemon juice, rind and butter.  I did cook the sugar mixture until very thick (like icing or heavy  custard) but once I added the juice and the butter it became pourable and never thickened up again.  The pie has been in the fridge for 24 hours and the filling is still the consistency of melted ice cream.  Why not cook the filling with the butter and lemon juice in it so you can accurately judge the consistency?  Did I cook it too long?  Not long enough?  There is no real way to know.  The taste is okay but not special even using fresh lemon juice, sweeter today than yesterday we all agreed, and the meringue did not weep at all.  It looked lovely until we cut it and it poured itself out of its crust.  IMHO, just not worth the effort given the ease by which one can make a real lemon curd for such a pie and avoid the issue of ""will it or wont it"" thicken.",3

Made as directed, including using the cast iron skillet, but didn't have any hamburger buns so I toasted some bread.  I learned a little trick from Zaar Chef Evelyn/Athens about browning ground meat and it's the only way I do it now.  When you think it's brown enough, cook another 5 minutes.  When you think that's done, brown another 1-2 minutes.  It gets the meat so carmelized and tastey, just like the crispy edges of a real diner burger.

This left a sweet and spicy liquid mixture to baste on them. I used only 1 tbsp chili powder but added the 1/2 tsp cayenne and also seasoned with fresh ground black pepper after I wrapped. I also flipped them halfway through cooking (total time 45 mins) I did some on the broiler and should have made sure to also put the foil on bottom part not just the upper pan (thats okay, DD will be doing the cleanup!!) I also had too many to fit on the broiler pan so I used a small pan that I lined with foil. This produced a blackened foil but a nice carmelization on the bacon (as long as you catch it early enough so the burnt smell does not permeate the wraps) Will try this again using some of the other suggestions of variation on spices. She will have to reheat so hoping they are as good as fresh out of the oven....my reward for doing the cooking!!",5

I used canned chickpeas to get around the chickpea problem from the previous poster.   (Dried ones are often iffy in final quality.)   I stirred some (1 tsp.) of the pickle in it, but not much because that stuff is really hot and strong.  Worried about DH not liking it.  So I set some on the side for me.  This is kinda a bland dish (which was great for him); good to spice it up with the pickle for me.  I went back and made the Ras El Hanout mentioned in the introduction and then served the whole thing over mashed potatoes.   I used 2 tsp. of the spice mix since I'd already put in the other spices when originally cooked.  This time, it was much better for me but overly spiced for my husband.   ZWT6",4

5 for flavor, but I did have to alter it to my tastes.

But a great dish, and I loved them baked.

I did use a good salsa. I do love spice, lots of it, but I cut back on the cumin and oregano.  However, I used a very flavorful good salsa, a more plain salsa or picante may require more seasoning. My salsa was a ""more gourmet blend,"" so it had lots of seasoning already.

I did use a Mexican blend of cheeses too.

My garnish was simple a green enchilada sauce, sour cream and diced olives.

If I was home I may of served over a bed of lettuce with some fresh diced tomatoes and scallions, but I was at work (making it for co workers) so I didn't get that fancy.

I did spray with olive oil vs margarine, and they turned out golden brown.

It was easy, great taste, much healthier and I enjoyed them.  Very very good.

Black beans would be another good addition to them, but the chicken and salsa was perfect.

Thx for a great easy quick recipe.

Being out of Taco seasoning tonight, I used this recipe as a substitute and my DH, who never says much, came to tell me that although he always likes this meal, something was different and it was just over the top!  There could never be a better review -- so much for store bought Taco seasoning mix.  This only took minutes to throw together and totally an already very good meal to the exceptional level.  This seasoning is made quickly with ingredients most of us already have on hand.  High five Kitten!!",5

I like my meal proportions to lean heavily to vegetables, so that wasn't the problem.  I think this recipe works best with tastily-spiced leftovers, not starting with unseasoned fresh ingredients.  Still, what I made was good enough to eat, and tasty enough to try variations on it later.  Cheese on the bottom ended up a lot like crust ...

I made them on my new George Foreman grill that came with waffle plates and they cooked up wonderfully. They didn't stick (I don't know if that had to do with the recipe or the non-stick spray I used), the outside got nice & golden brown and just a tad crusty while the inside was oh so soft-  just like we like them!  The kids loved them and hubby even ate 2 (which was a surprise.) <br/><br/>I used what I had on hand for the recipe- which was 2% milk & only vanilla extract. (I'm definitely going to pick some up for next time b/c I have a feeling it'll make it a five-star recipe then!) I also added a few dashes of cinnamon to the dry ingrediants. The batter was really lumpy which worried me, but after I cooked them it didn't make a difference. This recipe made 6 big waffles on my George Foreman G5 grill.<br/><br/>I think next time I'm going to try and make it healthier by using some wheat flour & possibly wheat germ or flax seed.

I do see why this recipe garners so many high reviews, though.  It is nice to be able to mix and bake everything all in one pan.  I also see the advantage of this recipe for those who can't/won't eat eggs or milk.  And I didn't note any odd taste, as some other reviewers have noted.  I didn't taste the vinegar or baking soda at all in this.  The cake is good for a quick and easy dessert at home, but if I need something to serve to guests or to take to friends, I will use one of my other recipes that yields a better result (with slightly more work and clean-up).",3

Boiling them in water, then broiling them in the oven sounded unusual, but I thought what the heck lets try!  I could not believe the end result!  They came out plump and crispy on the outside.  Everytime I would make baked wings, they always seemed to shribble up and never would crisp up very well on the outside.  I tried several different methods and recipes and it always was the same.  Not this recipe!  I was so surprised that a baked wing recipe could compare so close to the fried ones.  Absolutely the best, and I will always use this recipe from now on when I want to bake them.

The very, very middle of the cake was very soft but I couldn't leave it in any longer or the top would have developed cracks. I suggest adding a dash of salt to the cream cheese frosting.  This is a winner of a recipe.",5

I usually use the recipe on the back of the Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chip bag, but have been looking for something different.  These definitely are thick, soft, and chewy, but the taste is seriously lacking to me.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a 1 1/2 T. measure instead of a 2 T.  I ended up getting 50 cookies even out of this, but they have such an aftertaste of shortening that I really don't even want to eat them.  I'll probably end up sending them to work with my husband and let his coworkers eat them because they won't get eaten here.  4 stars for such a great texture, but 2 for the flavor...evening out at 3.",3

I followed the recipe for the sauce and the only change I made was to add about 4 cloves of chopped garlic and rather than cooking it in the crock pot I baked it in the oven at 325 for about 4 hours. Because of a family dislike of large chunks of tomatoes I chose to puree the sauce in the blender before serving and found it was perfectly thick enough that I didn't need to add corn starch.  The whole family gave it 2 thumbs up and even better requested it to be made again.,5

It has good texture (not watery at all) and when the vegetables are hand cut, makes a nice, thick, chunky salsa. Pace has nothing on this stuff! :)<br/><br/>However, in doing some research I found this same recipe on two other sites and both had the notation that if you are pressure canning, use 1/3 cup of vinegar, however, if you are only doing the hot water bath, vinegar needs to be upped to 1 cup for safety reasons. Recipes found on various canning sites also call for much more vinegar in relation to the same amount of tomatoes. I just question the safety of this when just using a hot water bath as opposed to pressure canning. I am going to uncan and refreeze this batch just to be on the safe side.",0

We thought the flavor was good, once they were cooked - mine looked horrid, haha - but my husband said he thought they had a weird aftertaste (I'm assuming that was from the baking soda).

My red potatoes and carrots were perfectly cooked as well. I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom and Garlic soup but might try Golden Mushroom next time. I knew I wouldn't feel like making a gravy if the soup was too thin for me when I got home so I just bought the thicker soup.",5

Great over spanish/mexican rice also.  <br/><br/>Just a note to those who couldn't locate the Land o' Lakes brand of white american--any white american cheese sold at your deli counter will work.  Same place you buy fresh sliced lunch meat.  American cheese melts better than cheddars and jacks which can get oily, stringy and grainy.  You can make it using cheddars but then you really need to stand by and stir often and keep and eye on it.   Cheddars are also stronger in flavor which will change the end result of this dip's taste.",5

I think I'll make this again and add salt, pepper, double the clams (he said the clam flavor wasn't very strong) and use fewer potatoes. There wasn't enough clam juice to boil the potatoes so I had to add water, and I think that is where the blandness came from.

I wasn't really sure how much to season the flour, but I added season salt to the flour and also added some of Paula Deen's House seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder) directly to the steaks before dipping them.  I actually didn't measure anything for either the steaks or the gravy, just estimated as I had cut it down to make 2 steaks.  It made a good amount of gravy, but we ended up eating pretty much all of it between the steaks and mashed potatoes.  Thanks for helping make my first frying experience a good one!",4

I also like to add freshly grated ginger for tummy aches or two garlic chunks for colds. (I take the garlic out after 4 minutes) This tastes very good and definitely has benefits for the look of the skin over time as it cleans the liver. Like other reviewers I feel a need to stress the importance of using a good quality local organic honey, ie not from the regular grocers! The best honey is local to wherever we live  because it helps with allergies and organic without additives. I do add more honey per preference and leave about 10 minutes with a small plate over top to keep hot and I find it has more lemon flavour which we like. I was originally debating 4 stars because I had a regular non-local honey to use. I find it doesn't taste as good as the local organic ones and more than once I felt it gives me a slight allergic reaction (non-local honey that is). Also the quality of water used is important as well. City treated water with tons of chemicals and hormones is a NO-NO for your health. I had used distilled water and would have preferred spring water. Since then I only use spring water. I never use a 1 inch slice of lemon as that is too thick. I tried it that way and it wasn't as good plus it wastes the lemon. I use about 1/4 inch slice. Oh and don't forget to wash the lemon before cutting it. A definite make over and over drink.

Once cooked I lifted the chicken out, in sections removed the skin & deboned it and served it rustic style on a platter accompanied by roasted carrots, parsnip & potatoes. The gravy is fantastic. I stuffed the cavity with quartered onions. YUM!",5

It tasted good and was super simple to make.  This method of making ""fried"" eggplant cutlets was easier, less mess and obviously healthier.  I would recommend letting the eggplant rest on the pan for at least 10-15 minutes once it has come out of the oven. All in all, a very good alternative to the traditional preparation, especially for those who are health conscious or are looking to spend less time and fuss in the kitchen.  <br/><br/>However (based on my own family's taste), for making Eggplant Parmigiana or for crispy cutlets that can be handled or eaten immediately after cooking, these cutlets just can't hold up.  Traditional pan-fried cutlets have a taste and texture that can't be beat BUT are not as healthy as this recipe.  The texture of this preparation doesn't seem quite cooked through even though it definitely is.  Pan-fried eggplant has a crunchy outer coating and an almost creamy interior.   This recipe produces a whole different ""mouth feel"" than pan-fried eggplant.  When using these eggplant cutlets in Eggplant Parm or any layered application, compared to the pan-fried version, these have a ""raw"" taste to the breadcrumbs and make for a sandy texture because the crumbs absorb all of the moisture in the sauce.  You will need to have extra sauce on the side.  I increased my sauce in an Eggplant Parm recipe by 50% and it still needed sauce on the side.  The breadcrumbs can't hold up to the sauce like fried cutlets can.   <br/><br/>If you remove the skin from eggplant before cooking, as many Italian-American traditional recipes do, cut your eggplant at least 1/2"" thick or your cutlets will fall apart when oven-fried.<br/><br/>This was a good recipe.

It can take a bit of time to get the dough to fully come together; I find that it needs more milk and/or oil than called for, otherwise it's really crumbly and cracks easily if it's too dry. The texture of the dough seems weird when handling, but after baking, it's wonderful. I always cut down the amount of salt (and usually the sugar) because I find it too salty otherwise.

I removed the pork, shredded it, bagged it and threw it in the fridge.  I discarded the cooking liquid.  The day I needed it (I was cooking ahead for my daughter's birthday party) I tossed it back in the crockpot and mixed in the barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's).

I did make some changes. I had 2 1/2 lbs scallops and looking at the amount of cracker crumbs, I knew it would of been too much for just 2 lbs. But considering the extra 1/2 lb, I stuck to the cracker crumbs amount, but still cut back on the butter amount.<br/><br/>Sea scallops are key, and dry if possible. If you can't get dry fresh scallops, make sure to dry completely on a paper towel before using. This will help avoid extra moisture which some mentioned.<br/><br/>Next, I did use fresh thyme and plenty of pepper and some sea salt.<br/><br/>I mixed the cracker crumbs with the butter, only 1/3 cup, not 1/2 as stated and then topped the scallops.  I felt there was less butter in the buttermilk at the bottom.<br/><br/>Also, I think it is important to get a pan that fits how many scallops you have.  This way the crumbs stay on top vs the bottom of the pan.  Mine turned out crunchy after 20 minutes at 425.  I cooked them a bit hotter, but I had very very large scallops.<br/><br/>It was not my favorite dish as I couldn't taste just the scallops, but for those who like more sauce or seasoning on their seafood, I think it was very good.<br/><br/>But I think there are a few tricks to dish for a successful dish",4

I layered the dish as follows, half of the potatoes, sprinkled with half of the shredded cheese, and add all of the meat.Added  the remaining potatoes, covered with foil and baked at 375 degrees for 1 hour.

I gave a big scoop of this to my Dad who always skips the Spanish rice and he ate the entire thing, raving about how good it was the entire time. Even the babies loved this rice as it is not hugely spicy. Easy and delicious means this recipe will become a regular in our family! November 8, 2010: I have tried other Quick Spanish Rice recipes but NONE as good as this one and it continues to be my ""go to"" recipe for Spanish Rice. I now start with 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil and saute the rice first which <br/>keeps the grains separate and prevents the rice from sticking to the pan. Then add the rest of the ingredients and follow the directions. Try this rice.... you'll love it!",0

Frosted with chocolate whipped cream frosting (tastes like ice cream with your cake) He came home and actually used the word ""phenomenal""!! His boss tried to steal the left overs and sneak home lol But I managed to get a piece. Used strong coffee for the water - that was my only alteration.

I made a variation on the bacon-wrapped jalapeno idea, and filled mine with 10 pieces of crumbled bacon, about 3 oz (from 4 oz can) diced jalapenos, and I used neufchatel cheese (low-fat cream cheese). I couldn't find the crescent roll tube size called for, but I got 48 (exactly, using all my filling) from two 8 oz crescent roll tubes, and I cut the rolls into 3 pieces each. This probably took me about the same amount of time as the bacon-wrapped jalapenos (although it was much cleaner), and it was nice to try a different variation of those. I can see using this idea with many other fillings too. Personally, I thought the bread part overpowered the filling part, but people at the party seemed to like them. Robust-tasting filling ingredients would work really good in this recipe, I think. Thanks for the idea.",4

A very simple and tasty recipe, I made this often when I have to work late for my husband and 3 year old.  I used dry onion powder vs regular onion, added pepper, garlic powder, dry mustard and a shot of Tabasco also, cooking with the flour. I also added a 1oz block of Velveeta light with the sharp cheddar I used for extra creaminess.  Noodles were added raw.   For those complaining it is too floury, be sure to cook your flour/spice/milk mix really well, that eliminates most of the floury taste.

At first I was weirded out that my kitchen smelled more like apple pie than turkey during the first 1-2 hours of baking.  It took 4.5-5 hours of baking at 325 to make a 14 lb turkey.

I tried the roaster bag for the brine as someone on the boards suggested but it burst and the brine leaked out.  So I transferred it to a 5 gallon bucket.  So, do not use the bags!

The second time I added 4 oz cream cheese (for half recipe) to harden the filling a bit and reduced white sugar by 2 tbsp. I also increased the spice: 1/4 tsp of clove and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. However, I didn't reduce salt and the filling turn a little too salty (there must be some salt in the cream cheese too: I used Lucern).

I did however, use 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter, and 1/2 creamy peanut butter, plus I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the recipe. I actually whipped up the cookie dough in the morning, then baked the cookies later in the evening, which the dough held together nicely. I used a small Pampered Chef Scoop, which is equal to 1-tablespoon, to help round out the cookies. I baked the cookies on a Pampered Chef Baking Stone for excatly 12 minutes, then let them set on the baking stone for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool. I found I got 28 (2-inch) cookies form this recipe. I couldn't believe how good these cookies turned out, as I was a skeptic at first, and wondered how one could make cookies with out adding flour to the mix. Well, I'm no longer a skeptic, and 'am glad I tried making these flourless cookies, as they were very good, but I would definitely chill the cookie dough for several hours before baking them. One more thing, I did take another viewers advice about rolling some of the cookies in brown sugar before baking them, as they stated it gave the cookies a toffee taste to them. I baked half the cookies that way, but felt the cookie lost the peanut butter taste in the process. My husband and I prefered the cookies with out rolling them in any sugar, and since I chilled the cookie dough for most of the day, applying a criss-cross pattern to the top of the cookie with a fork, was easy and I had no problems with that. Thank you Mysterygirl, for posting this recipe. It definitely is a keeper!",5

Everyone who tried it was in agreement that the soup was good, but maybe not great.  That could just be a taste preference.  My only complaint about the recipe was that my sausage was not done after 30 min at 300, but maybe thats just the type of sausage I was using?  I had to turn up the temp and cook for nearly a half hour longer than directed.  I also felt there was maybe too much sausage called for.  I cooked 1 lb (5 or 6 links) but ended up leaving out one of them because I thought it would be too much. Honestly though, I think it's mostly preference, I don't like sausage that much to begin with so that could be the problem.  It was fun to try something new though!",4

I have another ranch chicken recipe, but it takes 3 times as long to make and uses bone-in chicken, which some of my family members don't like. This one is not quite as good, but it is ""good enough"" and I can certainly see myself making this one far more often. The only problem I had was that I ran out of breadcrumbs. Next time I would double the breadcrumb mixture. I used 1/3 c. of cheese (cotijo instead of parmesan, but it is essentially the same) and 1 tsp. each of pepper and garlic powder. I actually had plenty of dressing. I cooked this on a rack in a half-sheet pan to try to make it more crispy. It still was not particularly crispy (maybe due to the lack of crumbs) so next time I might actually cook it straight on foil in the half-sheet to ease cleanup. I wouldn't use a smaller pan, though. I served this with Recipe #72735 and Recipe #321880.",4

I love brussel sprouts, but hate it when they are soggy.  I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and just love the way the outer leaves get nice and brown, and the inner part stays a little bit crispy.  I used 20 sprouts and couldn't fit them all in the pan cut side down, so I did it that way with as many as would fit, then just threw the rest of them in on top.  They eventually all got browned and I left the garlic in the pan - love it when it gets all carmelized!

Loved the flavor, but I think it would be even better if I let it sit overnight, so I'm thinking that next time (probably later this week) I'll do a double or triple batch of the broth, then freeze half of it and other half in the fridge overnight.  We'll definitely be making this a lot in the future!  Thank you for posting!",5

After I did the second stage cooking  I took the chicken out of the pan and kept warm and then cooked the sauce till it caramelized then re-added the chicken and mixed then served. This worked out perfectly, with the chicken having a nice crispiness to it. I give this recipe high praises and will do this restaurant quality recipe again.

And I didn't add the crystallized ginger, but would of. It just - it worth going to the store for just the garnish. If I had company I would of, and I know it would of been very good.<br/><br/>1 change and 1 suggestion.<br/>- I did add a bit of cilantro for a little color and a bright flavor with the rich coconut milk.  Just 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I enjoyed the bright flavor.<br/>- I would of added maybe just a scallion diced, but didn't have any. Just a bit of fresh bright green color to me is all I needed.<br/><br/>Second, I followed cooking directions for the rice that was on my package. I used basmati. I checked my long grain, basmati and jasmine and they all had different times, so I think maybe that is why people said it took longer to cook.  My package direction said 25 and that is just about how long it took.<br/><br/>I think it is just common sense to check. Not all stoves or pots cook the same. As is no rice directions are the same. I just cooked until tender. Cooking times to me are a guideline and should be used that way.<br/><br/>Also, follow the ingredients as is.  A recipe like this really benefits from fresh ginger and the red pepper flakes. That is what sets this aside from other rice dishes.<br/><br/>Very nice dish.  I served it with a Thai chicken and loved it. Have just a bit leftover for lunch tomorrow. I sliced up the little bit of leftover chicken for a perfect light lunch.<br/>Thx for a nice recipe<br/>Kim",5

(I think she used a recipe off Oprah's website - same thing, right?)  I may make a couple of procedural changes next time I make it, as I found the meat to be a tad underseasoned (easily remedied by salting before hand).  And I think I'm going to make my own beef stock next time, as I think that will improve the flavor, as well.  I used a Merlot as the wine, left the onion slices and carrots in because I was too lazy to pick them out.  I also used already cut stew meat to save time.  Don't think I'll do that again, either, as I don't think it has as much flavor as a whole roast you cut yourself.  The mushrooms and pearl onions were sublime, and I loved the smoky undertones from the bacon.  I will be looking forward to the next time I make this, in order to follow the recipe more closely and taste the differences.",4

I didn't have any lime juice, tho--even tried to find lemon seas in my spice cupboard, but had to leave it out. I did coat the chicken in olive oil, THEN added the spices to coat better. I used more salt & cumin, less red pepper (used cayenne) & less black pepper as well--hubby's preferences. All I had was green pepper, but that worked fine.

It was good, but I don't think it is really like PF Chang's.

NOT much, but it is definitely missing something.<br/><br/>But overall, they were good. I wasn't a huge fan of them when I got them at PF Chang's but my g/f was, so I made these for her.

When I review a recipe, I usually divide it in half and make it the original post and then add my changes. So here is the review.<br/><br/>First, I really didn't like the texture of the ground beef. I asked my butcher to take a round steak and rough grind it.  It gave me a more steak like texture and that made a huge difference  for me in the overall taste.<br/><br/>Second, I didn't find too much red pepper, it was fine for me.<br/><br/>Third, I did add broccoli because it was just to one dimensional for me, it need some texture and different flavors. I did use fresh broccoli and some fine match stick sliced carrots, just for a little crunch. I think that helped.<br/><br/>Overall the flavor was good, I used a good szechuan noodle but the sauce was not bad.<br/><br/>As one poster mentioned, it reminded them of an Asian Sloppy Joe over noodles. I agree in a way. That is why I think the carrots and broccoli and the meat texture really changed the texture, but not necessarily the flavor. I purchased my ground sirloin right at the regular grocery store. I just asked the butcher to rough grind it for me, or you can do it yourself at home.  I think it really helped the overall recipe.<br/><br/>I will try it again with a few changes. 3 stars for the texture and presentation; but 4 for the overall flavor<br/>Thx, Kim",4

I used 2 (5 oz.) chicken breasts, and it wasn't too much chicken (we didn't think). I used 3 tsp. of cajun seasoning, I cooked the chicken in olive oil, and used white onion in place of the green onion. I only had 1/4 c. whipping cream, so I used 3/4 cup fat free milk and thickened the sauce with 1 Tbsp water/1 Tbsp cornstarch slurry, and that worked great! I replaced the sundried tomatoes with diced tomatoes, because I don't like sundries tomatoes - it's a texture thing I think. Maybe a taste thing too, I dunno. Haha. I also probably doubled the garlic, because I like garlic (and the husband doesn't complain!).

There are not many recipes I can try to recreate that I can say that As my sense of taste is diminished I usually have to compensate by changing a recipe. and when I rate it I have to use my changes as otherwise it is not fare to the creator as sometimes I want to give a low rating when hundreds of others loved I know it is just my taste buds speaking and not fair to the cook.

Used Mrs. dash instead of seasoning salt because it's what I had on hand.  Definitely recommend using Panko crumbs.  Also pour out Ranch a little at a time so if you don't use it all you don't have to toss it because raw chicken was in it. Easy cleanup using foil too. My son who is 5 and is pretty much a vegetarian actually finished this off before his carnivorous 3 yr old brother.  Will definitely make again!,4

The only change I made was to use chopped walnuts.  Think I might add coconut next time.

I got an idea from Dr. Kaley to mix up the flour a bit and did the half spelt/half all purpose unbleached to make it.  This was my first spelt experience and I must say that the flavor is much lighter and less, um, earthy than doing whole wheat.  Great way to get some whole grains into the diet and the guys all gobbled them up! update: I've made these several times and sometimes they don't come out as good.  I think it has a lot to do w the temperature of the wet ingredient. Warm butter, cold egg and cold milk don't mix!

Also used fat free half and half with good results! I will be making this again!",5

My first attempt at making meatballs and it turned out great! I used 1 pound of 81/19 ground beef and 1 pound of mild italian sausage. I added a bit more bread crumb and milk since I added to the meat amount overall by 1/2 pound and just did by feel of the mixture. I still only used one egg. I used some Italian bread crumbs that I make and keep on hand and just added a littl extra oregano and dried parsely. I baked for 15 minutes and simmered in the sauce for 20 minutes. They turned out AMAZING and DH has said this is his new favorite way to eat spaghetti. So much for the regular plain ground Italian sausage I normally brown for my sauce! I got 3 dozen meatballs and used 12 and froze the other 24 for later use! Thanks Kitten for another easy and oh-so-succesful recipe! Love it!,5

My husband asked if this was like an upside down pizza, and I agree it has that kind of flavor.  I will fix this again adding more spice and vegies, maybe olives and bell pepper.

I subbed about 25 oz of crushed tomatoes and 3 tbsp of verde salsa.  Also, I had no carrots, and I think they woud definitely have added some good flavor.

I only had one bunch of Kale, so I cut back to 1 tsp of salt but used full amounts of the other ingredients.  Just because of his personal preference I will cut back a little more on the salt (I personally thought it was great).  Loved the flavors and texture.  I did over bake mine a bit even on 350, that was my own fault (and my oven bakes a little hotter) and it still had great taste, I just need to be more careful next time because over baking does make the Kale a little bitter.  We will definitely be making this again with 2 bunches and have plans to add this to our garden this year if possible!  Thank you for a great, healthy recipe!  Can't wait to have this again.",5

For the sauce, I mixed together hot sauce, chili garlic sauce to make it even more spicy, and a smokey bbq sauce just for a bit of depth. I tossed the wings in the sauce and broiled them for another 10-15 minutes, and they were perfect. The wings were so good, crisp on the outside and super tender inside.

This bread is terrific!!  I really wanted to purchase a loaf of Irish Soda Bread at a local bakery (and they make great soda bread)... but I figured I would give this recipe a shot since it had so many terrific reviews.  I am so glad I did.  This bread is so easy to make especially with my Kitchen Aid mixer and it so moist.  I did adjust it slightly.  I soaked the raisins in Irish whiskey (hey --St. Patrick's Day is almost here!!) and only put in 1 Tbs of caraway seeds and used light sour cream. I'll be baking this bread for St. Patty's Day instead of buying it!!  Thanks for a great recipe!! Happy St. Patrick's Day to all!!<br/><br/>UPDATE --I made this again ---in fact I made 2 loaves. I almost bought the irish soda bread at my local bakery because I was getting lazy!  I didn't.  This bread is so easy to make!!  I added 2 T of caraway seeds in each --so glad I did.  I again soaked the raisins in Irish Whiskey --- YUM!!. When I made the second loaf I didn't have any sour cream and I didn't want to run to the store so I used 2% greek plain yogurt instead. SO SO glad I did.  My second loaf turned out even better. I don't know if this was a fluke but I will try it with greek yogurt again.  I also made homemade butter - all I can say is YUM!!!  This is one of my FAVORITE recipes.,0

I wore gloves (which I already have for cutting jalapeno peppers) when I mixed up the ingredients, and I used my cookie scoop to make uniform-sized meatballs. After they were all scooped out, I just rolled them a bit (still with the gloves on) so they were more round. From the doubled recipe, I got 72 meatballs. I used some for dinner and froze the rest. They were the perfect amount of ""Italian meatball"" spicy-ness. My husband said, ""Where do you think the saying 'That's a spicy meat-a-ball!' came from?""

I subbed red pepper flakes for the cayenne and fresh parsley instead of dried. We really liked the seasoning - it had a nice zing without being too spicy and the lime was a great finishing touch. I don't like tough shrimp so rather then worring about browning I cook it at a much lower temp to try and get it to absorb the flavors, and pull it out off the pan when it's just barely done since it will continue to cook.

And yes, there is a little red wine vinegar at the end of cooking, but also red wine in the broth.  NOW, everyone has to remember, that a lot of their ingredients are commercial, so we can't duplicate it exactly.  But this was very nice.<br/>I added a bit of tomato paste for a little richness, and as I said ... it is close, and very good which is why I gave it 5 stars.

Due to the added liquid and the fact that I cook my pasta per servings in a separate pot (due to freezing) I only added 2 cups of hot water.

For the soft tops I brushed on melted butter as they came out of the oven and they were soft but not squishy.

I covered it with ganache--it was delicious! As some other commenters have said, it is not super sweet or rich, but it makes the perfect backdrop for a rich frosting or ganache. I like that this doesn't require baking chocolate squares since I never seem to have them on hand. It would be good with espresso or cinnamon to spice it up a bit, but for a simple chocolate cake, this is a great choice! I baked in a 9x13 glass pan and it was done in 30 minutes.***Edit to add: the cupcake pictures I posted have Recipe #454493 on them and that was fantastic as well as the ganache I usually use.

It's a great way to use up leftover half jars of spaghetti sauce in your fridge! I didn't have any thawed sausage, so I used a 6 oz. can of mushrooms and a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives in place of it. I didn't saute the onion pieces, I just cut them small, as they are not sauteed on a regular pizza. I used turkey pepperoni, cut some into 4ths to stir into the casserole, and left some for the top of the casserole. I used mini wagon wheel pasta, and just kind of eyeballed the sauce (I used tomato-basil Classico) and seasoning. The baking time and temperature were right on. I only made 1/4 of the recipe, since I was just making it for a dinner for my husband and me, but it would be a great thing to have and freeze. I would probably make it this way (with more veggies) again, since we usually order supreme-type pizzas. Thanks!",4

I used 1 egg white & added 1 tbsp chopped pecans & a few mini choc chips (very yum!). I do recommend preheating your griddle well since the batter is thin & the oats do tend to clump up in the middle--so mix the batter well. After I poured the batter, I used a spoon to ""spread"" the oats out so they'd be evenly distributed. I topped the 2 pnk w/ banana slices & sugar free syrup.

Origional review follows: I made these Saturday eve for a holiday cocktail party I was hosting for my neighborhood. They were very very easy to make. So easy, I wasn't sure if they would be good but they sure were. I used Kraft sharp cheddar cheese which was a nice compliment to the other items I put out and the abundance of wine that we drank lol. This is a great recipe to have at hand for spir of the moment gatherings or to keep hunger at bay if dinner will be late. Its a good thing I tasted one before I set them out otherwise I never would have, they flew off the plate so fast. Thanks for a great recipe.",5

Took another reviewers advise and carmilized the onions (adding celery and garlic to them) prior to adding to the mix, added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke as we love that smoky flavor and 1 tablespoon of worchester sauce for flavor.  Added another 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce and then baked as directed in one of those special meatloaf pans that has 2 layers and drains off the grease.  The end result was a lovely meatloaf that was firm when cutting and tasted awesome, took your advise and made extra sauce to use for dipping on the side.  YUM!!

I am renaming the recipe 1 measuring cup cookies.  Love the fact that I did not have a sink full of measuring cups after mixing the ingredients.

Used it for making a Chicken Caesar Salad PIZZA (see menu from Pizza Amore restaurant in La Crosse, Wisconsin for a description).   I had this while on vacation in June 2011, and wanted to replicate it at home for my hub.   Make a garlicky sauce, then add grilled chicken, veggies, cheese--and bake.   After it comes out and you slice the pizza, pile on some dressed romaine (the smaller the pieces the better it transports to the mouth on the pizza slice).   EAT and ENJOY!

I won't mash the lentils next time (as this - I think- might be responsible for a graininess noticeable in parts of the loaf) but instead add them whole. Because the celery & onion added a bit of texture/crunch to the loaf which helped with texture, next time I think I might also try adding sunflower seeds and/or grated carrots to the mix.

After reading all the reviews and looking at the recipe I had to agree it needed some spices. Did everything in the directions but added a pinch of nutmeg, some garlic salt, thyme, poultry seasoning, rosemary and about 1/4 cup white wine and I added a bit of frozen peas.  For the top crust I used Pillsbury crescent rolls. The flavor was so yummy, we really enjoyed this dish so much. I had made the mixture the night before and then made the individual bowls for lunch in the morning. It took just and extra 15 minutes in the oven. But next time I make this I would like it to have just a bit more juice to it. It had creamy flavor but I would of preferred just a bit more liquid so I would add a little more broth and wine. The wine really adds a very nice rich flavor to the dish. Thanks so much for sharing your lovely recipe vincy....We loved it....<br/><br/>UPDATE: Made this again and went with adding the extra 1/4 cup of wine with an extra 3/4 cup of broth which was an extra 1 cup of liquid to the recipe in all.  Perfect...and I measured the seasonings I put in and it was a pinch of nutmeg and a tsp. of the other spices mentioned above. It made this delicious dish even more yummy, had the perfect amount of creaminess...I would also like to add that I had timed myself and it was all done and ready to pop in the oven in 30 minutes not an hour....

I used onion powder instead of onions, used one cup of half and half and one cup of evaporated milk, its what I had on hand. I didn't have linguine so used thin egg noodles.

Thanks for the recipe!<br/><br/>They remind me of Pillsbury Grands but are more tender.  This morning I used 1/3 whole wheat flour.  Then tonight I used a little more than half.  They were both great.  I think with a greater quantity of whole wheat flour, a little more yeast is needed for the best rising results.  Next time I'll try 100% whole wheat.<br/><br/>My husband would like me to try one of the cream cheese frostings instead of this simple glaze... so I'll mix it up some time.<br/><br/>And a funny thing... I got mixed up on the recipe and didn't let it rise the extra hour after cutting them (they rise one hour in the bread machine)... they were still delicious!<br/><br/>Oh yes, and like another reviewer, I also use brown sugar instead of white sugar with the cinnamon... that just seems better and I'll stick with it because the results are FABULOUS!",5

It did take a while to cut the squash (and since I'm already having problems with dry hands, I used gloves as someone suggested, which did slow me down some), but it was so easy.

Other loaf I rolled out and made a large buffalo chicken filled sandwich and baked 25 minutes, brushing with the butter the last five!  Fantastic!",5

Didn't have fresh broccoli so used frozen which had been thawed. After browning the chicken I dumped the broccoli over the top along with the sauce and a few sliced green onions and cooked for about 5 minutes, adjusted the seasonings and served over rice. (149)",5

I made a couple of slight changes....Started with 1/2 lb pepper cracked amish bacon and the 1 1/2 cups left over ham cooking in pot with a bit of olive oil.  After the bacon sweated a bit - I took the ham / bacon mixture out.  I then added all of the veggies (plus lots of extra of each) and got the brown bits off the bottom of the pan.  Added the water and followed the recipe....except used whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and used 2 C light cheese.  I ended up needing about 3/4 C more milk b/c of all of the veggies.  The soup was still quite thick and excellent.  YUM.  Thanks  UPDATE:  just made this again - added a ham hock to the broth as the potatoes cooked - and the flavor is great.  Added a couple carrots to the veg too!  Used the immersion blender to puree a bit as well.  Sooooo goood!,5

Granted, I substituted Velveeta Queso Blanco since that's what I had on hand so I don't know if the low fat version would have made much of a flavor change.

I added a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, drained.  I added 1 stalk celery, chopped and sauteed that w/onion and also added a bit more cumin, cayenne and some chili powder.  I had to omit the cheese due to a dietary issue but did add about 1/3 cup of heavy cream, some cornstarch and about a 3/4 cup of frozen corn, to thicken it to make it more like a chili than a soup.

Must be a delicious sight (and taste) since nearly everything you've listed is a winner!<br/><br/>This IS better than any canned frosting and likely worlds healthier, too. I could eat the whole batch of frosting plain!<br/><br/>A few words of wisdom...After the first cup of sugar, I was actually okay with the flavor. It was sweet enough for me. I ended up using a little over 2 cups, but I don't think it was necessary, even with the 1/2-3/4 Cups of cocoa powder that I put in it. The other thing is that I kept adding whipping cream to get a fluffier smoother consistancy, because it seemed a bit stiff to me, but in retrospect, I think I added too much. This should be a VERY FIRM frosting, like the kind you do buy canned in stores. It could be thinner if you wish, but the taste of the cream really comes through, in that case. Also, if you are working in a (very) small kitchen with a very hot oven or in a hot climate, expect a bit of melting to occur. All the more reason to have a very stiff frosting, imho. I have a batch that were made in a ""cool"" environment that turned out absolutely fine but my second batch, made near a hot oven are swimming in frosting. THere are worse things that could happen, of course. :D I just popped them in the fridge so they should be fine. <br/><br/>I made as directed and just needed to frost a couple of batches of cupcakes so I had PLENTY left over! Glad I didn't double! So I'll be freezing it, probably in some sort of small bowl container with the tupperware type lid and then just defrost in the fridge when I need some Icing post-haste. I've got enough there to cover a cake, if I don't eat it all before it gets to the freezer.<br/><br/>Thanks again. No need for any other chocolate frosting/icing recipe. <br/>THIS is the ONE!",5

BUT, I doled it out between my family and myself, so none goes in the freezer, this time.   I prepared as directed, only subbing rotini pasta instead of spaghetti.  I always forget at least one item on my grocery list and this time it was spaghetti.  So I used 12 oz of rotini and followed the instructions as directed by the recipe.  It was so good and I believe it would even be better if I had used spaghetti.  I think that 12 oz of rotini was too much for the sauce mix, so if I had reduced the amount of rotini pasta that would have definitely helped, but I really recommend not subbing if you can help it.  Loved the cheesiness of the sauce and the little bite of heat from the mild Ro-tel tomatoes.  Just creamy goodness and definitely comfort food.

I just let it simmmer, simmer and simmer...it finally thickened up. I suspect that perhaps those that tasted too much vinegar did not let it cook off enough. <br/>I prepared my 4 chicken breasts halves(boneless, skinless) in the crock pot with the glaze and then poured it off into a small pot and simmered on the stove until it thickened. While the glaze was thickening, I ""shredded"" the chicken in large pieces.<br/>I also added some quartered onion and an additional clove of garlic which I made sure some of which simmered in the pot with the glaze.<br/>Served with steamed rice, carrots & broccoli. I think some water chestnuts would add a nice crunch, but I didn't have them on hand. Thanks for sharing!<br/>***Update*** With the remaining leftovers, and since we had a snowfall today (in October!) I felt compelled to have soup.

I put a pan of broccoli with EVOO and garlic next to it in the oven and at the 30 minute mark I put my rice cooker to work. When the hour was up I put the pot back on the burner and added some corn starch mixed with a little of the sauce and let it boil until it thickened. This was a very easy meal that I'm sure I'll make again and again. It was wonderful with the jasmine rice and would be great with mashed potatoes or even egg noodles.

I added some bacon wrap and let marinate for a few hours before cooking (just because I wanted to get the prep done early and have an easy dinner).  Basted every 10 minutes while cooking for about 45 minutes, at which point it registered 170 on a meat thermometer.  So I probably could have taken it out closer to 30 minutes.  Served with the sauce and a spicy Chinese style rice.  Overall I would say it is very good and I will make it again but probably tweak it by adding some pineapple for a sweet & sour flair or maybe some mustard for a honey dijon flavor.",4

I also melted the butter and mixed it with the Ritz crackers before I put them over the top to get a good even brown.

Filter the bones and veggies out, and store the stock in containers in the fridge.  After a few hours the fat will solidify on the top and can be removed.

I bought a pre-cooked ham (without a bone) prior to finding this recipe. Looking at the cooking time I didn't think my ham would really work so I took it back. The grocery store didn't sell ""raw"" hams which is what I thought I was looking for. (I don't cook a lot of ham.) The butcher suggested a pre-cooked spiral sliced bone-in ham. It did have a longer cooking time on its directions although it was only about 2 hours (it was half a ham...not 15 pounds). I cooked it for 2-3 hours at 325 (ham directions said 300 and this recipe said 350 so I compromised). It was still cold in the middle. I bumped it back up to 350 for about another hour and that was better. The end result was fabulous. So, for anyone who really hasn't dealt much with hams... I'm guessing the pre-cooked, no bone ham would have been fine with a shorter cooking time. The spiral sliced bone-in ham was fantastic as I spread each slice with the sauce before going in the oven. Anyway, I will do this recipe again. The ham/sauce is wonderful. Thank you!",5

I made the meatballs as instructed but cut them in half when I put them on the casserole so we had more. I followed everything else as written. The spaghetti sauce that I used was a very thick and hearty sauce so it needed the extra water but I would suggest using less (or none at all) if you have a thinner sauce to avoid the bread getting soggy. I used an Italian loaf that I cubed and let sit out overnight and the next day until dinnertime and the bread on the bottom actually got pretty crispy. I also made sure that I completely covered all of the bread with the cream cheese/mayo mixture to keep the sauce from dripping down onto the bread. Everyone really enjoyed this meal and it is now in our ""Make Again"" file. The only thing that got complaints was that my husband said when he heated it the next day for lunch, the bread had soaked up the spaghetti sauce and gotten soggy and doughy.

I brined the pork first (1 1/2 qt water, 3 T salt, 1 hour) which I try to do for all pork dishes. I had economy chops and did not remove any fat; I scored the fat on the edges so the chops wouldn't curl. I used a combination of Italian flavored panko crumbs and regular panko crumbs because I was out of other bread crumbs. I also skipped the parmesan (I know, I know - it's even in the title) because what I had on hand was shredded rather than grated and I didn't want to waste it. (I would have just moved on to another recipe, but by that point I was completely out of time.) Also due to the time crunch I skipped both the flour and the egg steps and just put the wet chops in the crumbs, like you do with commercial Shake n Bake. I baked them on a wire rack over the pan and used a probe thermometer set to 150. I don't know how long they took, but it was quick and might have been close to the stated time. My family members seemed to like them, and they would probably rate my version 3* or 4*; I don't give stars when I screw a recipe up this badly. :)",0

I made the recipe as written except I had a tray of 10 thighs to use up.

I flipped them after the first hour.<br/>Once they were done, I poured the liquid into a gravy separator to let the fat float out of them. Adding some cornstarch mixed with water and cooking down the sauce made it perfect for pouring over the chicken and rice.<br/>Thanks for a great recipe.",4

We had a lot of vine ripened tomatoes to be used up.  We made the recipe exactly as stated and made one batch with extra jalapenos for a spicy batch.  Since our tomatoes were already real ripe, the sugar really didn't need to be added.  We noticed that it gave it too much of a sweet taste and hid some of the spiciness.  But after the salsa has sat in the cupboard for a couple months the sweetness finally mellowed out and the spice has shined thru!  So if you added the sugar and was afraid it made it too sweet, just give it a little while to marinate to together and mellow, it will turn out fine!  If you plan on eating it all right away, than you can decide if you want to add the sugar or not if you tomatoes are already sweet.  The ratios in this salsa are perfect for a nice mild salsa.  Thanks for this great recipe.  Im sure when we want to can salsa again we will be coming to this one!",5

I used the IQF fillets, which usually end up really watery even when fully thawed. I also only had one pound, but it was 6 fillets! They were really thin. I should have spaced them out into a larger pan (my mistake). After the first cooking (10 min.), I used a turkey baster to remove some excess liquid. Then I added the topping and baked an additional 5 min. They didn't really brown but they were cooked perfectly (but runny again). I enjoyed the flavor, but my fish-hating son wasn't fooled. Even so, I will probably make this again. I have a few strategies up my sleeve now if I have to use the frozen fillets again, but I would love to try fresh.",4

I also used the entire package of onion soup, both times, but only because I didn't feel like having the open packet laying around. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe totally, except subbing Coke for Pepsi. I am a die-hard Coke fan, and would never have Pepsi in my house ;) It turned out great. So very tender and moist. Pork roast can sometimes be dry, and this was not at all. The second time I made this, I subbed the mushroom soup for a golden mushroom soup, and also the onion soup for a beefy onion soup packet. The second time had a rich gravy, slightly different. I think I did prefer the original version myself. There was so much nice gravy both times. I noticed it took a little more cornstarch to make it thicken, and I assume it's from the soda. Not a big deal at all, because this is worth it. The first time, we had mashed potatoes with the roast and gravy. I used the leftovers from the first batch to make a different spin on a traditional Sheppard's pie. Fantastic! The second time, I used the leftovers with wide egg noodles. All the kids liked it. Even my DD who is anti-pork. We just told her it was a regular roast beef pot roast ;) Cheers!",5

With that being said, I also noticed I ran out of canned black beans, so I ended up adding a can of pinto and a can of soy beans, plus I added 2 cups of frozen corn kernels. Since I added the corn and more beans, I found I only needed to simmer the soup for 30 minutes for it to thicken up. I did want to mention... when saute'ing the vegetables in oil, I did use 2-1/2 tablespoons, plus I added a bit more carrots (2/3's cup). I saute'd the vegetables for 9 minutes before adding the garlic, and after adding the garlic, I only saute'd it for 1 more minute. I enjoyed this soup topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. I do think by adding the hickory flavored liquid smoke, it gave the soup lots of flavor.

That may have been my fault though because I made homemade refried beans. Next time I'll omit the salt and might try making my own taco seasoning w/o it. I added a whole chopped green pepper to the hamburger (awesome!) and a layer of frozen very sweet corn between the meat and bean layers to balance the saltiness. I would definitely do that again, and possible add more. I am not a huge fan of chips, so the chip layer was so-so for me, but DH liked it. I think next time I might try noodles instead and maybe double the beans and 1/2 the meat.

I browned them then followed other reviewers suggestions and covered them and removed the foil for the last 10 minutes. This time, though, I only cooked them for a half hour and (20 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered) and they were still dried out.

Since I didn't make chicken in the recipe (made breaded, baked chicken breast tenders instead), I added some ground ginger & garlic powder with just a pinch of cayenne pepper to my sauce. I also steamed some broccoli and mixed it altogether with the noodles to complete the meal. Overall, it was received very well by my one year old, 7 year old and hubby.

I had fresh tomatoes on hand that I wanted to use up...used 4 garlic instead of 2...and added about 1 T of hot chili paste. The sauce turned out quite thick, so I added water to make a better consistency.  The cloves imparted a unique taste that I quite enjoyed.  I added a parmesan rind for flavor.  To prevent the onions and garlic sticking, I sprayed my Dutch oven with Pam and cooked them at a lower heat and had no problems with burning.  Next time, I would probably use fresh basil for a fresher taste. I used your recipe for meatballs and just plopped them in the Dutch oven, let them cook for  about 10 minutes, then stirred them around...then simmering them for 3 hours.  This is not the ""run of the mill"" type of sauce and turned out something quite unique.  The cloves do make a difference, but you have to like the taste in the first place!

There was no way I was going to get 2 tsp pork/shrimp mixture in that wrapper.  That took me about 4 wrapper duds to figure that one out!!  I could only find square wrappers, so that made them all that more fragile!  Second, I had partial froze the wrappers, but was in a rush so ended up putting them all together in a Tupperware and when I went to use them, they were one solid block.  I did a trial run with DH and took out about 12 wrappers.  They were thawed out before they went into the skillet, but even with the oil in the skillet and the broth afterwards, they ended up sticking so badly, the finished product was not very appealing! With my style of cooking,  I probably wouldn't use them as an appitizer, as I don't like doing last minute cooking before my guests and having to worry about the extra clean up!!!  Now with all that negative comments being said, here is the postive.  They tasted really great!  I decided to use the leftovers in a won ton soup!  I seasoned the chicen broth with sesame oil and soy sauce, brought the broth to a boil and added the frozen wrappers and cooked them for 2 minutes or until they all floated to the surface.  As I have 50  wrappers leftover, next time, I will add tofu, some chopped green onions and maybe some bean sprouts!  If I was to make the wrappers all over again, I would freeze them individually and place them flat with a layer of parchment or waxed paper in between.  I would definately consider omitting the cabbage, as it was more of a pain to get it in the wrappers and it was hardly noticed in the taste!  You have to have enough time to play around with these....I figured they took me 2-1/2 hours to complete them.  They were something interesting to do, and I might do them again if I am doing a Chinese theme type of dinner",0

Both time I substituted blackberries for blueberries (because that's what we have growing right now).  It is definitely important to cream the butter and sugar for a few minutes! The first time I just hand mixed them together for about a minute.  The cake came out dry. The second time I made it I used a hand-held mixer and creamed the butter and sugar for about 4 minutes. The cake turned out much lighter and was not as dry.  I also added some orange zest, which added a nice complementary flavor.  I made this in a bundt pan.  I added about half the batter, then the struesal topping, and then the remaining batter. Delicious! I will make this again.",4

I made it expecting what was in the picture and wound up with some kind of soupy mush of half-boiled/half-mashed potatoes, kielbasa and chopped vegetables. I followed the instructions up until I realized that the water was not going to evaporate. After that, I removed the lid and let it cook for the rest of the time (9 minutes), stirring occasionally to cook all of the potatoes. I wound up ladling out some of the soupy stuff so it would evaporate and I ended up with potatoes that turned (almost) to mush. We also found it pretty bland and we all doused it with ketchup to eat it. I really wish I would have taken a picture of the look that was exchanged between my son and husband when I sat the plates in front of them. The first thing out of my husband's mouth was, ""That doesn't look like the picture on the recipe card."" And he is completely right. Many people try a recipe based on the picture. I really wish the picture that is posted as the main photo would be taken to illustrate a recipe that isn't altered so much that it winds up looking nothing like the way it is supposed to turn out. Overall, the picture difference was bad but I would have had the same review of this recipe if the picture would have matched whatever I wound up with. I will definitely NOT be making this again.

It reminded me of a really wonderful pizza sloppy joe. It got great reviews across the board from our family.

SO glad I did do,<br/>Nothing best the best rating for this recipe will do!<br/>Thanks!<br/>***UPDATE Made it again today and was EVEN BETTER (as IF that were possible) Added finely diced bok choy and mushrooms; this time instead of waiting the 30 minutes, my bite size chicken was done so added about a tsp or two of Chinese cornstarch dissolved in water to the mix and VOILA!! GREAT again too!",5

He also complained of too much lemon flavor.  I thought the opposite--not enough, but he got the edge piece so that's probably why.

For my DH that loves seasonings he added Montreal Steak Seasoning as written and then again tableside. The key to this is using high quality ingredients. We used brewed balsamic vinegar and it proved to be well worth the pricey tag. Fresh garlic and high quality Dijon are important too. My family doesn't like Dijon but you can't taste it in this.

As a previous poster did I added one can of refried beans in for one can of the kidney beans blended as I didn't have a working blender and it was great. This is a less chunky chili so if you prefer more chunks add some bell pepper, more beans or chunks of onion or even chunks of beef. If not enjoy it's smooth texture.

He had two helpings, added some of the leftovers to his eggs in the morning (gross, I know), and took the last of the leftovers for lunch today.  It was really a great meal, and I think the key is the spaghetti sauce.  I used a homemade sauce that I threw together when I realized I didn't have any jarred sauce and I took the advice of other reviewers and added another 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes to the recipe. I also used turkey instead of beef and whole wheat spaghetti. I didn't have enough cheddar cheese for the whole casserole so I used a blend of cheddar, Italian blend and Parmesan.  I also added some dehydrated onions when I cooked the turkey for some extra yum.  I layered everything in my Pampered Chef deep covered baker, baked for 15 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

I've made them twice now, and both times I've skipped the soaking step and used the parchment paper method, allowing me to use the entire turn table in the microwave to place the potatoes on (the only microwave safe dishes I have are much smaller, so would limit the number of chips I can cook at a time).  I re-spray the parchment each batch, and definitely reduce the number of minutes to cook each batch.  First batch took 10 minutes, down to about 6 minutes for the 5th or 6th batch.  I just used salt and pepper.  I was considering making them for a BBQ tomorrow, but I think it would take way too long to cook enough batches for 15 people (I can eat almost 2 whole potatoes worth just by myself if I'm not careful!).

My tenderloin was a little too rare for our liking; not sure if it was under cooked or cooked perfectly but looked under cooked based on how we usually cook it (we may just over cook it usually).  Was very tender and juicy and I just sauteed the slices in a pan for a couple minutes on each side to be sure it was cooked through.  Will use this method again; even with cooking the tenderloin slices afterwards it still turned out more moist and tender than any other way we have cooked it.

I don't like crock pot cooking so I used the dutch oven method (90 minutes at 350) and the chicken thighs were cooked perfectly. I also added the rest of the coconut milk (1 can minus the 1 cup for the rice) and used medium fresh salsa from the grocery store. I put limes in my cart at the store but somewhere along the way my 2 year old ejected them and I didn't notice. So I substituted white vinegar for acidity. I'm sure this took away from the flavor of the dish though.<br/>Overall we liked the flavors a lot, but the texture, between the rice and the sauce, was a little gummy. This is where some fresh lime juice right before serving would have come in really handy; I think it would have cut the thickness of the sauce beautifully. So next time, and there will be a next time, I will make sure to have the limes at the ready.<br/>My 2 and 3 1/2 year old daughters and husband enjoyed the meal, but my 6 and 7 year old sons were not that thrilled with it. The peanut garnish helped them get through it though!<br/>Thanks for posting.

I suggested that we make a batch and freeze. Forget Eggos!!!! He said yes, but we would need to borrow another waffle maker to make it go by faster. I made my daughter one with syrup and another with light whip cream. She said she liked the whip cream better but she is 8. Light syrup was fine by me. Thanks for recipe!!

After these changes this is now one of our favorite meals.<br/><br/>Great soup - DD thought it was a little too spicy and said to reduce the green chilis to one can but I thought it was great.  I did add about one extra cup of cheese.  I thought this would be thicker than it was but that's okay - it is delicious!,4

This was ok.  Everyone ate it but no one wanted seconds. I had issues some of the other posters have noted. The ""sauce"" was runny like soup and not creamy. Next time I would have to omit some liquid. The cream cheese didn't dissolve in the last hour properly. I think I will warm it with the soups then add it in if I made it again. Not as easy as this states but would be creamier. The color was plain and the flavor was a tad bland. I would need to find a seasoning mix of herbs to jazz it up.

After reading the reviews I made some adjustments to the method as well as ingredients.  I have never had the Panda Express version so wasn't likely to be disappointed. :)<br/>First I made the sauce in a small saucepan, choosing to saute the ginger and garlic at that point rather than adding it to the wok prior to cooking the chicken.  I included the cornstarch so it was ready to go.  I tripled the sauce and was glad I did.  <br/>Along with some other reviewers I dipped the chicken in the egg mixture and then dredged it with flour before frying it in a wok with the chili peppers and green onions etc.  This streamlined the process as I was not required to set aside the chicken other than to wipe out the pan.  Tossed in the sauce and 5 minutes later we were eating.  This is definitely a Five Star tasting recipe but in fairness I can only give it four for all the adjustments I thought necessary.

I was only making 3 x 1"" thick chops but used the full amount of gravy ingredients.  It went in to the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours with a pan of brussel sprouts, carrots and cauliflower put in to roast for the last 40 minutes.  I found it very flavourful and suspect that those who didn't may not have used the concentrated broth.  It would make a huge difference substituting regular broth imo.

In any case, it was just too much, in my opinion (and I adore garlic.)  I think next time I'll cut it back to 3 cloves fresh and 1/2-3/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I have to admit that I made a substitution of canned milk for the light cream (I had no cream) and made a mistake in the layering order, ending up with cheese on top, which made a crunchy cheese layer, but that didn't change the flavor, only the texture.  I also didn't have any seasoned salt, so I just used plain salt and cut it back to just shy of 1 tsp. for the entire dish, and that was very much more than plenty.  I used just 1 pound of ground beef, and that was also plenty of meat.  Perhaps the larger amont of beef would have been able to handle the additional 1/2 tsp. salt, but I doubt it.  (The soup has a lot of salt in it already, and the dish was very salty with the scant 1 tsp.)  This dish is a lot like the flat enchiladas I often make using corn tortillas instead of the potatoes - both are wonderful family dishes.<br/><br/>After reading comments about the potatoes taking a long time to cook, I started out the dish with slicing the potatoes and putting them in water on the stove to boil.  When the sides of the pot were boiling, I then turned off the flame and let them sit in the hot water as I prepared the remaining items.  It did help, but still took 1 1/2 hours to get done, and could have easily cooked another 1/2 hour before the potatoes turned mushy.  So, parboiling or pre-cooking the potatoes is definately in order if you have any time limit in your schedule.",4

Zapped the mix with my immersion blender until smooth, then added extra sharp cheddar and a ~3oz lump of 2% Velveeta for extra flavor.  Perfect texture, not too thick at all.

Had no decent green beans so omitted those.  Was feeding two hungry teenagers so threw some potatoes in the pot and was really generous with the spinach (I had a lot that needed to be used up).

I used worcestershire, but could do without that. So, next time it will be salt (lots), fresh cracked pepper, and garlic powder. That'll be it and I'm pretty sure it will be just what we were hoping for... thank you. Your recipe changed our crock pot roast cooking forever! :)",4

We like these flavours, and the recipe is so quick and easy. I also wonder if cooks who were not happy with the results really used real Parmesan and a good creamy Caesar salad dressing? I only added a very little extra seasoning-with-a-bite (dry Piquante Pepper seasoning/Peppadew) to the Italian herbs, but used the recipe unchanged. My chops were nicely cooked after 25 - 30 minutes, but cooking times depend so much on the different ovens. The flavour was great -- mild but tasty. I did not use loin chops (terrified of their notorious ""dryness""), but a chop cut which had some marbling running through them. So they were juicy. I should add we don't mind a little fat at all ... I'm pleased to see that some doctors and dieticians are coming round to the idea that a little animal fat (used for 1,000's of years, after all!) are not at all bad for us!!

I was searching for a frosting that hardens and allows for easier, neater cookie storage.  Only after making many modifications, the frosting turned out.  Like other reviewers, I felt the instructions for the frosting were unclear in terms of the amount of milk.  Far more than 1 tbs. is needed to achieve the right consistency, so I would suggest indicating the exact amount (or an amount closer than just 1 tbs.) would be much more helpful.  Plus once I finally reached the right consistency, I realized the flavor was lacking.  I ended up whipping 2 tbs. butter, 1/2 tsp. lemon extract and 1/2 tsp. salt into the mixture for more flavor and less tacky texture.  The frosted cookies did harden, as the recipe title promises.  The trick must be the addition of corn syrup.  Next time, I think I'll just add corn syrup to my standard butter-based frosting recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This time I I wanted to have it well seasoned and know I picked the right recipe. I still used the turkey bag, so I followed the instructions other than putting the chicken broth in the bottom and doing the last few steps. The turkey came out juicy and tasty, and I got quite a few compliments at dinner. The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the butter/seasoning mixture really hard to spread over the turkey. It ended up in clumps that didn't melt during cooking because there was way too much seasonings for the amount of butter. I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the full amount in the butter plus sprinkle them over the top, which is what I did even though I thought it might be too much. Based on the results, next time I think I'll just add the onion and garlic to the butter and then sprinkle the rest on top. I think the butter will melt better that way and I won't end up with almost black clumps that ended up not soaking into the bird. I also didn't have tarragon but I didn't miss it at all with all of the other seasonings packing a punch!",4

While it was roasting I made yeast rolls, stuffing and side dishes, and was REALLY getting nervous about having to make gravy to feed all these people.  Naturally, I turned to Recipezaar and was so relieved to find a No-Fail Turkey Gravy recipe from a chef whose recipes I have used many times before!  I skimmed the fat from the pan drippings and added enough canned chicken broth to make the 4 cups.  Followed the directions and it turned out PERFECT.  My only comment would be that on an electric cooktop like mine I had to up the heat a little bit to get it to thicken, but once it did, I tasted it and it was delicious (no ""raw flour"" taste at all). Transferred to a small crock pot to keep warm until it can be transported to the inlaws' house in a  couple of hours.  I am sure it will be a hit!

I made according to the recipe, although I only used 2 cans of beans...the poster actually said she cut the bean amount, so I felt that was okay on my first try on this recipe.  Maybe the extra beans take away from the sweetness, but I have always enjoyed a ""meat"" chili, not a ""bean"" chili, so tried for that. I enjoyed the mix of cubed sirloin and ground meat.....that is what I usually use.  I also do not use chili powder, basically making my own.  However, this chili is extremely sweet.  I can't say it is awful, but my mouth recoiled when I took a bite....it was expecting ""chili"", not candied baked beans.  This recipe is edible....but it doesn't taste like chili to me.

I read many of the reviews, and it seems like the recipe has been updated since it was published in 1999, which is good, but I wish it mentioned that so you could know to ignore some of the comments.  I still found it confusing - cup measurements for the onion, celery, etc., but ounces for the chicken (fyi, 12 oz of chicken turned out to be 3 cups in my kitchen).  Also, what size tortillas?  If you buy the little ones vs. the 8 or 10"" ones, it can make a big difference.  I was also confused by the direction to break them into pieces - tear maybe, but my tortillas were too soft to ""break"".  Is the can of tomatoes optional?  Or the dicing?   It would have helped to have these things clarified.<br/><br/>That said, I did follow the recipe except where I made the following changes to make it a little healthier:  cut oil down to 1T, used McCormick's Low Sodium taco seasonings, only used 4, 8"" corn tortillas, only used 4oz of cheese in soup, used skim milk.  For the chicken, I bought a rotissery chicken from the grocery, and I used every spec of chicken on it for the 3 cups.  I think I agree with the reviewers who mentioned adding raw chicken to the 1st step as a savings - although it might not break down as much in the soup.<br/><br/>My tortillas took a LONG time to break down, and some pieces remained.  I don't agree with some reviewers who said this was quick - with over an hour of cooking time (where you have to watch and stir), and multi-step prep, this was a weekend project for me.  It did make a lot, though, I got 10, 1 cup servings from it, and I froze some for lunches.

I processed the veggies in the food processor until fine and added 1 can of white kidney beans (all I had) so I added about 1/2 C of pot barley to help thicken the soup.  Mine is much thicker than the photos linked to the recipe.  Like another reviewer I added my parmesan rinds to flavour the soup instead of topping it on the soup.  As much as I enjoyed this soup, I found that 2 tsp of Italian seasoning may be too much for my taste otherwise it was a solid recipe.  Thanks for posting Barbara.",4

I roasted the beef until it reached 150 degrees, removed it from the pan and kept it warm, then poured out the juices and added some veg oil to the pan and browned a couple of tablespoons of flour right in the pan over low heat.  I added enough water to the juices to make about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of liquid and poured that back into the pan and whisked with the browned flour.  What a delicious gravy that was!!

After reading the reviews, I decided a couple of changes...I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs cut into pieces, and dredged in some cornstarch. (1 tablespoon = 2 thighs) I boiled down the sauce a bit before adding the chicken (approx. 15 minutes), and once I added chicken it cooked very quickly. (20 minutes). Other then that, I did everything else the same and it was Awesome with a capital ""A"".",5

I couldn't find small dried red peppers, and used larger ones.  Just reduced them down to 6 instead of 8.  But will probably leave it at 8 next time because I ran out of peppers when enjoying this wonderful meal.  This is absolutely fabulous, and I'll enjoy this often!  Thanks for sharing!

I do agree the directions were a tad confusing, however after reading reviews I made some adjustments and it turned out perfect. First key is that the flour / cornstarch / egg mixutre is a WET batter. I increased to 2 eggs and a splash of water to get a thin pancake like batter consistency. I also coated the chicken pieces (I used cut up chicken breast tenderloins) in cornstarch first for about 10 minutes so the wet batter would stick to the chicken when I fried it. Second key is to use PEANUT oil if at all possible for frying. It really does make a difference in flavor. I used a wok and about a half inch of oil and the chicken turned out nice and golden brown. If you are frying in small batches, keep the fried chicken in the oven on warm on a wire rack and it won't get soggy. Third key is to use fresh ingrediants (ginger, sesame oil, etc.). I also adjusted the sauce (yes, double it!) to using a combination of white and brown sugars and reduced the vinegar by half, substituting the remaining vinegar with the juice of the orange. The zest is a must. I made the sauce in a separate sauce pot and let it reduce while the chicken was frying. I also added a cornstarch / water slurry to thicken the sauce just before I tossed it with the chicken. I will say this recipe is probably not best suited for the first time cook, however if you have the passion and the time, anyone can make it and is worth the effort.",4

This recipe works well with all sorts of modifications, additional vegetables etc. I first put the stewing beef in a few tbs vinegar and Motts Tomato Juice for 35 minutes to help them become tender and give it some extra flavour. After I drained them and began the recipe. I used white rice flour instead of regular flour to be gluten free. Before I added the big pieces of vegetables I cooked the meat for approximately 40 minutes longer than called for in recipe#206712 instead of beef broth as I could make it easier. I used 3 medium carrots in all, cut into big chunks rather than diced or chopped fine for more heartiness. I used one less onion than called for, though my onions were pretty big. I exchanged the thyme to marjoram due to personal preference. In addition to the called for vegetables I added some chunks of butter nut squash one time (wouldnt do it again), a large handful of fried okra one time which was a good addition, and about 1/3 cup frozen baby peas near the end of cooking time both times. I served it with quinoa macaroni if wished. I would make again during the winter for a warming lunch or dinner.",5

I didn't have any fresh fruit around so I tossed in a teaspoon of cinnamon & a teaspoon of vanilla plus a fourth a cup of chocolate chips & 1/2 cup of brown sugra.  Hardly tasted the cinnamon, and if the brown sugar added anything I would have been really disappointed without it.  I also added instant coffee--sprinkled some in, and a spoonful of nutella to half of the muffins.  The flavors didn't stand out at all.  Guess I need to be more bold next time.  Also, the muffins weren't moist. I can possibly blame over stirring for that--though I was anxious the whole time about all that others had warned about, I stirred in my added ingredients AFTER the milk/egg mixture & maybe that's what overdid it.  Or maybe I baked it too long--20 minutes as opposed to the 25.  But if either of those things were to blame, I wish the recipe would have been more specific to prevent though issues.  Still, it was an easy--nearly one bowl recipe.  I'll probably be returning to it.",4

I am amazed that as Roosie {another reviewer} stated ... they turn out like lightly baked potato chips. ...  oh.. just tooo tooooooo delicious. Thanks for a tasty recipe!... and a healthy one to boot!  UPDATE 02/21/2013..  These are still terrific for a snack. Your kale needs to be DRY BEFORE BAKING it. So.. what I do is: the night before I make them I wash and spin dry the kale. I then put it into a new large mesh bag (the ones that you use for laundry or lingerie) and put it in my refrigerator overnight. When morning comes around your kale is nice and dry. I also bake these longer on a much lower temperature to reduce overbowning. I bake them on 275 degrees F  and check them after 10-11 minutes and take the crisp ones off while allowing the others to remain on the cookie sheet to be baked a little longer.,5

Update:  We make this all the time now, and every time I have company they request the recipe.  Changes I've made: I add enough potatoes to just be covered by broth, so I don't measure.  I don't peel the potatoes, just cut into pieces.  I use Johnny's seasoning salt, which is wonderful.  After stirring in the cream cheese, I blend this with an immersion blender to break up the potatoes and mix the cream cheese all the way thru, then bring it back up to serving temp.  Garnish with shredded cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, and green onion as needed.  It's great with and without garnish.",5

I have always prided myself in my split pea soup (our ingredients are near identical) but this method will now replace mine.  I am convinced that soaking the dried peas in the hot water for 1 hour (w/o seasonings) makes a HUGE difference. This soup is much smoother in consistency than any other split pea soup I have had or made.  I used chicken broth, more thyme as pinches can vary, no beef bouillon cuz I forgot, and a smoked butt. I have always used a stick blender at the end, that said, this soup blended up smoother, no kidding! My husband could not stop praising this soup. I'm so glad we have some leftover for lunch today. YUM!  My recipe is now out the window and this recipe is replacing it. Thanks for sharing this gem, Uncle Bill!",5

I used a homemade mayo that was mostly olive oil based (too strong for spreading, but great in recipes to my tastes), and probably had a little less than a cup in the bowl.

Of course, by the time you have completed the cooking in the foil packets, you have essentially boiled the ribs anyway, and the rub/bbq sauce has permeated the meat.  I drained them after cooking, lined another pan with heavy duty aluminum foil anb proceeded under the broiler.  This really made the ribs.

I gave this cooking method a try and was pleasantly surprised.  The low cooking temp made the majority of the interior stay nicely pink - medium rare - while the exterior was nicely crusty.  That&#039;s the way we like it.  I only let my roast sit out about 1 hour, so it was not quite room temperature, but I don&#039;t think that affected the outcome too much.  I seasoned my roast with a spice mixture called Essence (by Emeril).  I skipped putting anything except the garlic in the slits, being unsure about how to get the seasoning into the slits.  I think just salt and pepper would have been fine, but you could really use any seasoning you like.

I expected a lot from it, but to me it tastes exactly like it started as canned pork and beans. It is just too sweet. I used only half the brown sugar called for because we were worried that would be the case, but it is still way too sweet from the brown sugar, chili sauce( which is glorified ketchup), and tomato paste. If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the recipe for you. If you want a rich, authentic chile flavor, find a more traditional recipe that uses toasted and pureed chile peppers, which will have the flavor notes of coffee and beer. This recipe also makes a huge amount, much more than 6 or 8 servings, so now I have a freezer full of it. Sorry, but it doesn&#039;t work for me.",1

I followed the recipe to the letter this time and we found that it was very, very bland.  If I make this again, I will definitely spice the chicken up and use hot salsa.  Also I will add canned chiles.  It was a decent recipe, just not a favorite in our household.  UPDATE: Made again 2/13/13 and used a 24 oz jar of Great Value Hot Salsa and stirred in cooked rice just before serving and this tasted much better.  Our family likes things a little spicy, so the hot salsa and the extra quantity really helped to make this something we can enjoy often.  Thanks Jen.&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: Made for a third time on 3/30/13 and used a homemade salsa from this site ( Recipe #485128 ) and the recipe was sooooooo much better.  I am even bumping the star rating from 3 to 4.  I want to love this recipe so much because it is so easy, but it still needs a little more work.  I will continue to tweak it on days when I need crock pot meals.  Thanks again Jen.",4

First off, I have nothing to compare it to, being I live in MX and the tortilla soup is totally different.  I omitted the carrot...had none and went with the optional tomato and otherwise followed the recipe.  I found it bland (Mexico&#039;s fault) and thought of re-naming it Chicken Tomato Tortilla Soup.   I do appreciate that the soup does not contain beans nor corn.....as the other recipes have.  I do want to thank you for the recipe. I did like the tortillas boiled in the broth!   I will take the boiled tortilla method and run with it!!!",3

I was wondering if the portions were spot on? Reason being that it serves 10-14 it says as of today and there is only one lb of pasta called for. I had to make another pound to serve that many but didn&#039;t need to make more sauce. So next time 2 lbs of spaghetti and this sauce as written. The slow simmer is great. The water is too much but I will likely do 1 cup or none next time. I simmered for 2.5-3 hours and there were watery plates. BUT it was so delicious. It got raves and raves.  You have a winner here.

After I reduced the gravy down I tasted it and decided it needed more spices, so I added more thyme and a small clove of minced garlic.  Because it was so soupy, the gravy part flooded over the potatoes as it cooked so I drained some of the gravy off and then continued cooking.  Nice flavour though, so I will try again with some alterations. Thanks for the recipe.",4

Otherwise, I followed the recipe using the beef broth and it turned out to be quite good, as well as quick, easy and very nutritious.   And the next day, it was even tastier.

I didn&#039;t realize my scale was off by an ounce so only used 7 ounces of pasta. We used Tillamook cheddar and real butter. Again, the key to white sauce is to cook it long enough so the sauce doesn&#039;t taste like flour. This was super yummy! LOVED how saucy it was, almost all of my family of 9 liked it!!  Thank you, we will be adding this to our menu!  UPDATE:  I have one child who requests this daily!!  But with the price of cheese I just can&#039;t do it. BUT we have had it about 3 times in a month as it is so easy and yummy.&lt;br/&gt;Update 5-3-13: you have to use REAL cheese. Not marble, not pre-shredded.. The preshredded stuff has rice flour added to it so it doesn&#039;t stick so your space will be grainy. Also, you need to cook your flour in the butter for a minute and then when you add your milk make sure to bring your sauce to almost a boil or even to a boil, then remove from heat and add your cheese then. This is NOT Kraft Mac and cheese, this is real food, dump and stir doesn&#039;t work. You do have to put some effort into it, but so worth it.&lt;br/&gt;We have used Tillamook cheddar, Tillamook white cheddar, cheap cheddar, sharp cheddar.. The key is CHEDDAR, and shred it yourself",5

Thanks so much for the excellent recipe, it will be my goto for making turkey &amp; chicken breasts for salads &amp; sandwiches. Ps. I used Earth Balance in place of the butter as turns out I&#039;m allergic to dairy :(",5

I love it and I know it would be wonderful without the changes I had to make in order to use what I had on hand:  1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter, plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the milk chocolate ones.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to mash my bananas up better than I did.  I had some visible banana chunks in mine which I would have preferred not to have, but that&#039;s not the fault of the recipe.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!",5

I increased the recipe, used the individually frozen wings from Costco (unthawed), enough to fill my stock pot, then placed on a foil-lined sheet pan sprayed with oil, and broiled at 425 in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes on each side. Then just tossed in a bowl with Franks Buffalo Wings sauce. They were perfectly cooked. Next time I would make two sheet pans worth, these were gone in no time. Definitely better and better for you than purchased wings. I&#039;ll try BBQ and other wing sauces, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",5

I think I&#039;ll go with granulated garlic next time to see if that&#039;s it.  I cheated a bit to not heat up the house so much by pre-cooking my wings in the crock pot, then I poured the glaze over and cooked it on in about 20 minutes in the oven with convection and finishing up with broiler, turning once to coat as the sauce thickened.  I love how this sauce thickened and coated everything, and liked it more after it sat a bit as far as flavor.

I used half of a huge squash, so the amounts were probably the same, but cooked in the microwave to save prep time.  I added some extra veg, sauteed onion, celery, and garlic, since I only had mild Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also added sliced black olives.  I was worried about the liquid since the can of tomato was smaller, but it still had a bit of standing liquid in the bottom after baking so I think it was all good.  I used a shredded pepper jack, rather than plain jack cheese, and garnished with sour cream before serving.  Will definitely make this again.  Leftovers reheated very well the next day.

I don&#039;t usually make many cookies anymore. These were absolutely worth it. I must of made them a bit bigger because I only came out with 29 cookies, and I suppose that is why they took a few extra minutes in the oven. I too made my thumbprint in them again as soon as they came out of the oven. Made for a nicer indent for that delicious lemon filling. It was the perfect amount of lemony taste. This is definitely a make again recipe. Thanks so much for the recipe post Lavender Lynn. Made for the Comfort Cafe &#039;09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: I have made these so many more times since &#039;09 and just wanted to mention since I didn&#039;t go back to update before that to be sure to use real lemon zest off of a fresh lemon or the color will not be a bright yellow. Also I used a Melon ball scoop to get the right size and made 35 each time. But it definitely takes a good extra 5 minutes in the oven. I have to keep mine in for 15 minutes. So you just may want to watch this when you make them. I just did another batch this week to bring to work and they all raved about how delicious they were and they all want the recipe. Just want to say thanks again for sharing.",5

I wondered how good it could be with just basic ingredients, no extra seasonings, meat or veggies. I even put a Italian seasoning grinder on when I set the table, just in case.  Well, no one needed it.  A basic but terrific lasagna.  UPDATE: When I made it tonight I altered it a little because my fridge/freezer went out and I needed to use things up. I probably used more of some ingredients than called for. My cottage cheese was low fat. I had about 1/4 of a green bell pepper, and a couple of slices of sweet onion that I diced and sauteed. I added them to some veggie crumbles I had left over and put them in the center layer of the lasagna.  It still made a great lasagna, everyone went back for seconds!  DD even asked if we could have it again this week.  Served with garlic bread and salad.",4

(I DID try to cover them while cooking, but it didn&#039;t help.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edited to add: I&#039;ve made these several times since. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Don&#039;t over cook or cook until they look &quot;done.&quot; If you do that, it will end up like a very dry cake with all of your chocolate chips on the bottom somewhat dry and slightly burned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Instead, cook the brownies in a LARGE pan (they really rise from all those eggs!) until they no longer shake like jelly in the middle when you shake the pan. Once it&#039;s firm enough not to shake, leave them in another minute or two and then take them out! THEY WILL NOT LOOK DONE! But, once they cool, they will firm up into very fudgy ooey gooey brownies that are absolutely heavenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Enjoy!",4

These were simply awesome.. The DS repeatedly said &quot;Honey, did I tell you how great dinner was&quot;.. Based on other reviews, I made only minor &quot;tweaks&quot;. Since our preference is to shred the chicken first, I used 2 large bone in split chicken breasts. Seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, salt and pepper. Roasted them in the over for an hour. I also made sure I used the pan drippings in the sauce. I sprinkled the leftover seasoning mix on the chicken after shredding. For the cheese in the filling, I crumbled queso fresco cheese, then used the cheddar / jack blend for the top (I mean really, why not have more cheese!). Other than that, I made as stated. Although next time I make these (and there will be a next time!) I wonder if I should add some black olives... hmmm..",5

One 10 3/4 oz, can Campbell&#039;s Cream of Mushroom soup, one 10 oz. can of Rotel, 16 oz. chicken broth, and one pound of cooked chicken breast cut into bite-size pieces.  Yesterday was a typical summer day in Huntsville, Texas and I didn&#039;t want to turn the oven on.  I cooked the pasta in a six quart pan, drained it and added all of the other ingredients and put it on the stove top and cooked on low until everything was hot, bubbly and melted.  It was rather &quot;soupy&quot;, but I think it will thicken upon setting from the starch in the pasta.  If you want your version drier, use less broth.  I think a typical can of broth is about 14 1/2 ounces.  I purchase the 32 oz. cartons of broth.  I was extremely happy with the result!!!

To be honest, I&#039;m not sure there was any difference between the baked ones and the nuked ones.  Regardless, they are so tasty, we completely cleaned the baking dish in one sitting.  I did think the onion taste was stronger than needed, so I&#039;ll only use the 1/2 cup green onions next time instead of the full 1 cup.

This recipe was featured the other day and I saved it to try.  I have just now completed it and it is delicious!  The only change I made was to use a Mexican style blend cheese, because that&#039;s what I had.  It is not grainy, gritty or disgusting.  Remember, the  cheese you select to use will dictate the taste of the dish.  I have no burned flour taste.  I completely melted the butter, whisked in the flour, whisked in the milk and then kept whisking until it was thickened to my satisfaction.  I left it a bit runny, because the starch from the pasta will cause it to &quot;draw&quot; up.  Removed from the heat, stirred in the cheese until it was melted and creamy, then stirred in the elbows.  Pure mac and cheese heaven!  This is a classic recipe and not to be confused with a boxed mix or that made with Velveeta.  Velveeta isn&#039;t even classified as real cheese (and I still love it!).

Well, when I read the ingredients for the sauce DH said that it would be nice to try with codfish. OK, tried that and it was a hit. Made just as stated (with the codfish instead of shrimp) with the exception of, as another reviewer suggested, decreasing the cayenne pepper to just 1/4 teaspoon and it was plenty. Next time I will also decrease the thyme to 3/4 teaspoon as it was a little overpowering. We had enough sauce to save for the next day when we tossed it with spaghetti. Delicious!

The boiling step brought out what my husband called a &quot;smell&quot; that  prevented him from eating. I think it brought the marrow out of the bones or something. I am not sure if this is specific to the cut of meat, so I am not assigning stars. It would be about a 2 otherwise. I used half of the spice listed and Recipe #287041 instead of the sauce. I also think the oven time after boiling was a bit excessive. I did broil for 15 minutes on each side, but had to move the oven rack down after the first 15 minutes. The meat wasn&#039;t tasty. It was a bit too tough on the outside and tasted boiled on the inside. The spices that I added to the water did come through, so maybe I just need to brine the wings instead of boiling them.",0

While I am not a huge fan of the recipe as written, my family loves it with nacho cheese soup (2 cans) and golden mushroom soup. We also have run into the problem of it becoming runny, which we remedy with stirring in some sour cream before serving. I followed the advice of another reviewer and dusted the chicken with spices and browned it before adding it to the crock pot and it definitely perks up the flavor. Cook time usually runs around 5 to 5 1/2 hours. Any longer and the chicken tends to get that weird texture that is somewhere between boiled and dry. So based on rating this as soley a base recipe that someone can build on, I give it 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4). The original is lacking seasoning and not cheesy enough. Cook time is definitely way off, too.",4

Well, when my husband suggested I make her a &quot;special&quot; pizza, I knew exactly which recipe I was going to use.  I made the dough and divided them into four pieces.  I rolled each out into a 7-inch pizza.  I made the one pizza for my daughter&#039;s school and pre-baked and flash froze the other three.

Came out beautiful.  You must add the icing, it really gives it that cinnamon roll affect.  I can&#039;t wait to try it with Jam n Fruits.&lt;br/&gt;I just want to add that since I made this recipe two weeks ago, my 5 yr old Grandson has asked me to make it twice.

At the beginning of cooking I added 1 mild orange bell pepper which blended right in and was a low cal addition.  Lastly, added some Greek Seasoning.

Next time I would also increase the aromatics, maybe add more flavors to increase the complexity of the sauce, and add the cornstarch to the sauce instead of the meat, to avoid the mess that created.

I don&#039;t think the cake rose as much as a cake mix would have, and it was dry and lacked structure.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but may have done something wrong, or perhaps my baking powder was limp.  I did bake the cake for 35 minutes, next time I will only let it go 30 minutes, see if that helps the dryness.  I topped the cake with recipe#89207 .  All in all, I loved the ease and taste, and will make again.  Thanks for sharing MizzNezz",4

A keeper and a great way to use up those strawberries in your fridge that are starting to turn. Plus it&#039;s kind of cathartic to smash up those berries with a potato masher.,4

I must disclose my mistakes, however, so others might avoid them.  I didn&#039;t have ricotta so I put some cottage cheese in my food processor to smooth out the texture.

Then I got cocky and thought, &quot;I&#039;ll just mix up the whole thing in here.&quot;  This would have been OK I think up to the spinach part.  When I added the spinach in the whole thing turned GREEN!  Duh!  If I&#039;d stopped at that point and mixed in the spinach with a wooden spoon as you suggested, it would have been fine.  But seeing the red sauce, the white noodle, and the green inside looked like a bad Christmas movie. It tasted fine however - delicious.

I made a triple batch of these noodles to use for chicken and noodles.  I made the noodle recipe on Sunday morning and didn&#039;t cook them until Tuesday morning.  I rolled and cut out the dough and layered them in a rectangular plastic container with sheets of wax paper between each layer and then stored them in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook them.  I boiled two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in chicken broth until they were done, shredded them and stored them in the refrigerator too.  Two days later, I boiled a big pot of chicken broth (I think it was approximately 60 oz.) and dropped the noodles in one at a time.  Once all the noodles were cooked I added the shredded chicken.  Then I took a 4.5 oz packed of peppered gravy, mixed it with some of the chicken broth until it was smooth and added it to the chicken and noodles to thicken up the sauce.  I put it all in my 6 quart crock pot and set it on low for 2 hours.  I took the crock pot to work and set it on warm.  The chicken and noodles sat in the crock pot from 5:00 a.m until lunch time (12:00 p.m.).  About 1 1/2 - 2 hours before serving time I moved the temperature from warm to low to heat the noodles up more.  At this time I had to add water to the noodles because they were getting a little dry.  When it was time to serve the dishes, the noodles were perfect...they did not disintergrate and get mushy...they were soft but still had a &quot;bite&quot; to them.  Everyone raved about the noodles and they were all gone except for a thin layer at the bottom of the crock pot.  TIP:  Use a plastic crock pot liner to make clean up easier.  I am making the chicken and noodles again for my family&#039;s Thanksgiving feast.  This one is definitely goiing into my keeper file.  Thanks, kindcook, for an awesome recipe!",5

Next time I make it, I will break the spaghetti into smaller pieces, just to better mimic the original, not that it will make any difference in taste or anything. I attempted to make only half of this recipe and, as expected, ran into some issues with getting the rice and pasta done before the liquid evaporated. So, I just added more liquid a little bit at a time as the rice cooked. This seemed to work pretty well; but I managed to lose some of the chicken flavor in the process. I am very glad to be able to make this dish so much cheaper than buying it and am excited at the possibilities of what could be done with it. Thank you! UPDATE: I&#039;ve made this recipe several times since my first review. (These days, I usually season it with recipe #105993.) As much as I love the recipe, I kind of dread breaking up the spaghetti noodles. Since I prefer to break them almost as small as the rice, this can be a tedious process.

I wanted to prepare my gravy the day before Thanksgiving so I had no turkey drippings since I hadn&#039;t cooked my turkey yet.  I had purchased some turkey gizzards for my stuffing, trimmed them and boiled them in some water.  I took the trimmings (throw away pieces) and fried them in some butter for some turkey flavor.  I added them to the broth and let simmer to help bring out the turkey flavor.  Then I proceeded to make the gravy.  I used 4 cups of organic no msg chicken stock and 4 cups of the water that I used to boil my gizzards in to make the gravy.  I removed the trimmings and gizzards before adding the broth to the rue.  Used a ton of white pepper and then took two gizzards and a laddle full of gravy and pureed them in the blender.  I then added that back to the gravy.  Added a bit of salt, but not much, and some more pepper until I got it to my liking.  It was seriously the best gravy I&#039;ve ever made.  Will be making this again!!  Thanks!",5

I lay the beef in strip by strip as I found it difficult to untangle the pieces as they were cooking.  I ALWAYS double the sauce and I add more carrots and sweet pepper strips to up the veggie content.,5

It avoided the sticky gooey bottom crust problem, while still giving you 2 crusts.  However, the amount of flour in the sauce thickened it to the point of making it disappear as sauce and turn into goo.  I highly recommend either increasing the liquid or reducing the thickening flour.  I think the flavoring could also be improved with some thyme and/or garlic.  It was pretty bland.  I&#039;m going to try some of the other pot pie recipes here before trying this one again (with the tweeks I recommend.)  I&#039;m hoping I can find a better recipe next time.",3

We made several different sizes from 1&quot; to 2&quot; and found we needed different baking times based on size and thickness - 6 minutes for the smaller/thinner ones, and 7 minutes for the bigger/thicker ones. Time cooling also seemed to affect whether or not they held together...we had some angel wings and heads break off trying to get them off the pan :(  Overall, this was a simple and flavorful recipe - we used powdered sugar to roll out, and the dough was the perfect consistency. We did chill it for about 15 minutes before rolliing them out, but after that we used the dough at room temperature with no problems. Will definitely make these again.",5

I bought a great five pound prime rib (2 ribs serving 4 people) from my local butcher.  Pretty pricey, but so worth it. Instead of inserting cloves of garlic into the meat the night before (I totally forgot), I heated up 2 tbsps of extra virgin olive oil along with six cloves of garlic (with skin), once the oil was infused with the garlic (you will smell the garlic/do not let it burn), I bumped up the heat, and seared three sides of the meat (couldn&#039;t do four since, it was all bone) and let all sides get crispy.  Let it crisp up, do not move it too much, once you see a thin layer of shinniness on the seared side, you know its ready to flip. The rest of the recipe was followed to a T.

It now shows 450 degrees to cook it at. We did it at that temp and on the bottom rack with good results but beware the sugar mixture still smoked. The garlic was a sharp flavor in this and was a little potent despite picking normal sized cloves so don&#039;t use big ones. The foil lined pan is a MUST! We doubled the sauce and still it doesn&#039;t adhere or remain on the chicken fully. The meat was juicy and moist however. The outside of the chicken was tougher and was where the flavor was. It definitely is a tame recipe seasoning wise so next time I will season it up.

Taking the advice of a couple other reviewers, I used Crisco and flour and heavily coated my pan.  I also left it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, and probably could have left it another five or so.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  I would like to suggest that those that had issues used too much flour.  You must fluff the flour and then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup and lightly level off.  If you use the dipping method, you will end up with too much flour.  Also, in my experience, you cannot over beat the fats.  If your butter starts to separate, throw it out and start all over.  Pound cakes are tricky and I think these are the two main causes of failure.  This is extremely high fat.  If you worry about fat calories and grams, this would not be the recipe for you!

I sauteed one large shallot with four celery stalks chopped and four red skin potatoes with their skins still on but chopped into large pieces.  Only sauteed above for about 4 minutes then added five sliced cremini mushrooms and two serrano chilis which I minced finely in addition to five cloves of garlic which I grated.  Let that cook for 2 minutes then added the flour and stirred well.  Added Better than Boullon chicken flavor with two cups of water and heavy cream, brought up to a boil to thicken.  Then added 1/4 cup chopped italian parsley and salt and pepper.  Added about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup dry white wine.  Needed a bit more flavor for our taste, so I added 1 tsp. of thyme and two packets of Swanson&#039;s Flavor boost, chicken flavor.  Added the rotisserie chicken pieces then and poured all into a Pam sprayed 9x12 casserole dish.  Topped with one package of Pillsbury Crescent rolls, which covered the whole filling(had to stretch it a little to reach the corners) and then I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  Really easy and tasted great!!!! Made again but used sherry instead of wine, used pearl onions, green beans (cut into 1&quot; pieces), 4 carrots, one bell pepper, 4 Serrano chiles and I used one pkg. of crescent rolls for the bottom crust and I used two pkgs. crescent rolls for the top crust.

I also accidentally used a different mix--brown gravy mix as opposed to the onion, but it tasted wonderful nonetheless. I&#039;ve made recipes combining cream of mushroom soup with onion soup mix, and I think I like this one better! The gravy had wonderful flavor, and the cube steaks were very tender. I did do a few things differently--I browned the steaks in a large skillet with some sliced fresh mushrooms, foregoing the crock pot only because I had lots of dishes already, and didn&#039;t want to make more. Lol  While they were browning, I combined the soup with the gravy mix and water, and upon noticing it wasn&#039;t onion gravy, added a few tablespoons of dried minced onions. When the steaks were browned, I poured the gravy mixture into the skillet, covered it, set it to &quot;simmer&quot;, and then let it do its thing for about 2 hours. The result was yummy! I also only had a pound of cube steaks, but prepared and used the entire amount of gravy. (Recommended.) Or, if you do have the two pounds, you may want to double the sauce if you&#039;re serving with mashed potatoes, noodles, dumplings, or fries, etc. I served ours with American cheese and potato pierogies, ladling the luscious gravy over all. But we could have used even more, since as it cooks, the gravy tends to thicken, and reduce to some extent. Next time I&#039;ll try it with the onion gravy mix, and transfer the cube steaks to the crock pot. Thank you Southern Chef, for sharing your recipe! This is a definite keeper!",5

My first 2 batches  of cookies flattened out and ran together. I had to cut them apart with a pizza cutter. For the 2nd two batch, I used parchment paper with better &amp; more ideal results. I love the slight texture the oatmeal adds to the cookies. The overall flavor is great, no sweeter than any other chocolate chip cookie I have ever eaten. Baking for 10 minutes results in a chewy cookie. I baked 5 minutes longer for a crispier cookie. Batch 2 still &quot;fell&quot; and flattened out but did not spread quit as much. Since this was too unpredictable, I am giving a 3 star rating for taste. I may try making them again one day to determine if it was pilot error or the recipe itself, and report back.",3

Easy to throw together and tastes divine. We used butter (1cup) for taste as we dislike margarine. It was a good substitution. We used hotdog buns for the bread and the spread and it was terrific. You need some sort of bread with thickness or a crust because the spread it heavy and could get soggy. The rolls, french bread, crusty bread, buns etc make the bottoms not burn due to being a thicker bread. We served it with spaghetti, meatballs and salad and felt the bread&#039;s taste was just as good or much better as premade garlic bread sold in stores. It was identical to garlic cheese bread we have had at restaurants too. The cheddar makes it kid friendy too. We will make again and again because it is so good.

I can&#039;t see baking the chicken at a higher temp, not if you want burnt, dried-out chicken.

My daughter is allergic to eggs and soy, and I was looking for a hamburger bun recipe suitable for her.

I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.

I added maybe half a carrot for extra vitamin A and some quartered artichoke hearts because I like them.  No changes at all, otherwise.  Also, I was unclear whether I was supposed to add all of the dressing to the salad.  I did, but it seemed excessive so I poured off most of it.  As per Scotch Bob, I did marinate most of the veggies in the fridge with the dressing before putting everything over the lettuce and adding olives and cheese.  I did include some parmesan cheese.

I needed to use my toaster oven, so I used a small little square baking dish.  I didn&#039;t want to bother sauteeing the onions (big mistake), so they were a little strong in the dish.  They really do need sauteeing like instructed.  I added about a half bag of frozen peas/carrots.  I only had room on top for 5 biscuits (the small can), and that left LOTS of the pot pie with the dish.  I froze part and not sure how it will be thawed, but I reheated some the next time, and it was still VERY good.  I heated up the rest two days later, and still good (actually better).

The chops turned out dry and the gravy was really thin so I thickened that up with a slurry of cornstarch. The total cook time listed is way off.

For one thing, the time to make - 28 minutes is a complete fallacy.  The recipe says to add all the ingredients and brown the potatoes - it doesn&#039;t give any clue of how long it will take, but I can tell you that I saut&eacute;ed the potatoes for over 10 minutes, and they still were not brown.  At this point, I was up to 15-20 minutes of prep (all the chopping) and cook time.  I added the other ingredients (I used chicken stock as some other reviewers suggested, unfortunately, I did not read the review that said the recipe had too much liquid, and I added a hole can - 14oz - of stock).  It then took another 5 minutes to bring to a boil.  I set the timer for 5 minutes so I could uncover and stir.  When I checked after 5 minutes, now down to low, it didn&#039;t seem like the potatoes would cook.  After 10 minutes,  turned the heat back up.  When the 20 minutes were done, the potatoes had finally softened (I used red bliss), but, there was a lot of liquid left so I left the lid off and let it simmer another 10 minutes.  If you are keeping track, we are up to 55 minutes.  I finally added the cheese, and that seemed to make the liquid into more of a sauce, and the result was pretty good - very tasty, it reminded me of sausage and peppers that I make, and I ended up sopping up some of the gravy with bread - so very carb heavy meal.  I wish I could figure out a good vegetable to have with it (besides a salad).",3

The 4 cups of rhubarb only filled  the 8x8 pan 1/4 of the way up the side in it&#039;s raw state. Once cooked there would have been maybe 1/2 an inch of filling. I went and cut 4 more stalks which gave me close to 7 cups and raised the rhubarb level to about 2/3 up the side of the pan and, of course, I need to increase the other ingredients that went into the filling. Also not mentioned in the recipe is a sitting time (30 mins for me) to allow the sugar (I used a sugar - Splenda mix -1/4 sugar to 3/4 Splenda) to draw out the juice. That&#039;s important because it keeps the filling from being dry and the thickened juice is an excellent part of a crisp. There is also way to much sugar in the topping for us so I used 1/4 cup Splenda Brown and 1/4 cup Splenda. I use Splenda because I&#039;m diabetic but it measures and sweetens exactly like sugar and I would use the same changes if I were using sugar. With more rhubarb and less sweetner this make a dessert that we well enjoyed.",2

I made a few drop cookies as the recipe states. They were so moist and delicious. I also made some big flat ones by pressing the drop a little further. They turned out crispy. Loved both versions.

They may have looked ugly, but boy were they good!  Thank you for your recipe.  I will attempt the cake version next time.",5

I liked that my son (10 months old) was able to eat with us as everything was nice and soft. For this reason I didn&#039;t add any seasoning. Thanks for a keeper!&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: I made this again, adding 2 chopped parsnips and they gave the soup a lovely sweetness. I&#039;ll definitely do this again!",4

I did salt the eggplant first (I googled it), and used panko bread crumbs - they do make it crispier I think. I also used parchment on the cookie sheet and had zero problems with sticking. When I flipped them I sprayed the tops again with spray to get them even more brown. I used 1/2 lite mayo and 1/2 greek yogurt, plus watered it down a bit so it went on smoothly. I also needed more breadcrumb mixture than this made - basically doubled it. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside!!!",5

Next time I&#039;ll probably throw in an extra 2-3 jalapenos plus more seeds and I think it&#039;ll be perfect.

I dislike how STRONG fresh ginger is, so I used ground ginger, but I doubt that would make the difference given how I feel about the overpowering taste of fresh ginger (I just can&#039;t grate or mince it small enough not to feel bowled over). I felt there was too much meat, too. (To be fair, I generally like most recipes better after I halve the meat and double the veggies.)

Sprinkled a little sea salt over the top as well as a very small sprinkle of a Garlic Garlic seasoning I had on hand.  Cooked at 375 for 1 hour then for another 10 to 12 min at 425 (because I added biscuits to oven to be cooked at higher temp).  I did not add the topping, as we don&#039;t like our meatloaf too sweet and it already had ketchup inside and I like to serve with brown gravy, which I did.

I&#039;ve made other breads before but this was my very first raisin bread and it was definitely a success! I did add wheat gluten to my flour (about a rounded teaspoon per cup of flour) which helped the bread have a nice rise. I also followed other suggestions and soaked my raisins first in some hot water (I personally found 3/4 cup was a good amount of raisins but will probably throw in an extra handful or two next time just because I love raisins!) Then I let the same water cool a bit and used that for the water in the recipe. I also added the raisins directly into the liquids before adding the dry ingredients and my bread machine had no issues mixing the raisins into the dough (and my raisins stayed intact through the process!) I also used brown sugar instead of regular white sugar, cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon (as I used salted butter) used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and left everything else the same.

Mine has more flavorings and less fat.  It is not posted here but includes a bay leaf, paprika, onion, and regular milk instead of cream and milk.  I think the raw flour taste in this is a reasonable critique.  I felt this did have some raw notes.  I&#039;m not sure if it is because I didn&#039;t simmer the sauce long enough or if the roux was the problem.  I did cook the flour in the butter a bit more than the usual amount for a white sauce, but maybe it was not long enough.  So, be sure to cook the flour in the butter a long time (longer than usual).   I also used panko bread crumbs, which I think was a mistake.  Regular bread crumbs would have been better in my opinion - just goes to show you that the recipe means what it says.

I shredded then added barbecue sauce and cooked for an additonal 2 hours. then warm as had to keep warm until my party. I had 8 sandwiches plus extra in a bowl plus all men ate 2 sandwiches apeace plus they added extra meat to their sanwiches. Everyone loved the sandwiches. I probably could have rated higher but with all my problems one of which I eat very little meat - which was no fault of recipe I rate 4. I used recipe#19023 for barbecue sauce and this time it came out kinda strong so used vinegar/sugar trick to lessen spices work with some but not all types over spicing I used half vinegar half sugar. As some of the reviews said it needed more liquid even though I halved recipe I used the full amount of ginger ale. or rather the substitute one of the members suggested 1-1/2 c water, 1 T brown sugar though I only used only 1 T. ginger root grated. this is a fantastic recipe",4

I used quite a bit more powdered sugar (probably at least half a cup) because I didn&#039;t want them to stick to each other.  I already tasted one and it was very good.

First, 1) Your recipe has to be one of the finest, best written and most detailed recipes I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of reading!!! How I wish EVERY recipe was this thorough! Not only did you mention bowl size (major props on that point!) but also repeated the ingredients in each step, as cookbooks of old, did. I write out my recipes the exact same way so I truly appreciate the detail and time it took you to post this. 2) End results? Perfect! Incredible! BEST banana cake I&#039;ve EVER eaten!!!! Followed everything to the letter (did sneak in 1 tsp of Vietnamese Cinnamon). NEVER had over-flow from 9&quot; x 13&quot; pan; mine was done, to perfection in one hour flat! Had no room in freezer but breezeway was at 38 degrees so I set the pan out there, to cool.Used a modified version of your cream cheese frosting; only 2 cups of powdered sugar vs. the amount you posted. Makes for a less sweet frosting and more &quot;cream cheesey&quot;. My friends and family were over-the-moon for this cake, so I thank YOU for posting it! Job well done, Rhonda J!!!!",5

Which worked out well, because the first time the texture was way too soft. So the second time as I was mixing I left out the cream. Instead I alternated between adding powdered sugar and the soft frosting of my original batch.  Still not the perfect texture for piping, but useable.

So, I decided to try this recipe.  I doubled it because I was bringing it to a pot luck and because I bought the large tub of marscapone.  I also didn&#039;t know what caster sugar was, but going on one of the reviews, I used powdered sugar - and it worked fine.  I also only made the 2 cups of coffee, but I used about 1/4 cup.  I can&#039;t imagine using so much liquid in the recipe.  I very quickly dipped the lady fingers so that they were barely wet with the coffee.  The recipe came out excellent.  I think tiramisu is all about ingredients (use marscapone, good lady fingers, and good liqueur - I used Kahlua and brandy) AND technique - the whipping of egg whites and folding, and not soaking the lady fingers are key to a good tiramisu.  My original recipe called for some of the coffee/liqueur mixture in the marcapone mixture - I&#039;m not sure if this recipe needs it or not, but it wouldn&#039;t hurt either.

My daughters thought these waffles tasted like regular pancakes.

That yielded 14 fluffy waffles and I think the added cinnamon and extra vanilla gave the waffles an added flavor that we would have missed if omitted. To make the waffles extra fluffy, I poured the batter into the waffle iron and left the lid up for a minute so the bottom portion of the waffle could rise. I then closed the lid and let the entire waffle cook through. My family and I ate five of the waffles for breakfast and I froze the rest.

However, I found it needed a little extra salt--1/4 tsp. extra--for our taste. I also added a 28 oz. of tomato sauce to the meat. The taco seasoning was beautiful. Keep in mind that if the seasoning comes out too spicy for your taste, you can balance out the heat with some added sugar. Thank you for posting.",4
46739,tsr version of applebee s honey grilled salmon by todd wilbur,7,12,30,579.6,18.0,271.0,63.0,97.0,10.0,23.0,265954,2015-08-30,"I rarely cook salmon well. I don&#039;t know what it is about this type of fish that eludes me, but I&#039;ve learned to steer clear of salmon because, although I love it, I botch salmon recipes time and again. The fish market had a sale on wild-caught salmon, so I picked up a fillet. I don&#039;t like baking salmon because of the way it makes the house smell, so I looked up a grilled salmon recipe on good ol&#039; Food.com/ex-Recipezaar.com and found this recipe. It was so, so simple to grill this salmon this way and make it taste delicious. I started by patting the salmon dry with paper towels. I don&#039;t know if this removes some of the &quot;fishiness&quot; that cooked salmon tends to end up with, but it has made salmon less fishy-tasting for us in the past. I coated the fillet with olive oil on either side, added salt and pepper to taste, and then grilled for 6 minutes per side over medium-high heat for an average-sized salmon fillet. That&#039;s all I did and the salmon tasted great before I even added this wonderful sauce. 

The sauce is involved, with many ingredients, but utterly worth it. This sauce made the salmon taste even better. I will say that I used orange juice instead of pineapple, a dash of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne, and I used half the amount of sugar listed in the recipe. The sauce was sweet enough and would&#039;ve been too sweet if I had used the full amount of sugar, and too spicy had I used the cayenne pepper. I made double the amount of sauce and have frozen it in batches to use on future fish or chicken dishes. Thanks for making me less scared of cooking salmon! Be well.",5

I usually roast them in the oven after a quick sear on the cut side in the pan with butter and olive oil, but leaving them in the pan to cook slowly definitely worked just fine! I had 1 lb brussels sprouts, so I decided to cook them all. As a result, I increased olive oil and butter to 2 tablespoons. I also used minced garlic and left it in the pan for the whole time. Sprinkled freshly ground pepper and salt when the brussels sprouts were cooking. I did have to cook them a little longer than the recipe states, but they came out great! Parmesan cheese was definitely an essential touch for this recipe! Thanks for posting! I will make this again.",5

I also prefer to buy thin cut, bone-in pork chops to eliminate the oven step and simply pan fry them. It&#039;s an easy meal that tastes out of this world with a simple green salad.

Since mushrooms cook down and release so much water, I added a 12 oz. cup of water to the dish instead of the recommended 16 oz. Based on several of the prior reviews, I also added oregano to the dish, and was liberal with the black pepper, since the recipe as provided would have been a bit bland for our taste.

The batter texture was like fluff, it is awesome.  I didn&#039;t touch the batter at all until the very last cookie, pretty sure any additional heat would melt the butter in the batter.  I used a tablespoon and got a little carried away with heaping tablespoon size.  So my cookies were huge and some broke when transferring to the cooling rack.  I did not get even 24 cookies.  Totally my fault though.  Next time I would stick with the teaspoon, and make it a heaping teaspoon.

The sauce was the height of velvet deliciousness, and there was plenty of sauce.    I used lowfat milk, full-fat cheddar and real butter.    I took the perfectionist route and sprinkled in the flour (not having Wondra on hand), and I couldn&#039;t believe the texture.   I did have to add a little flour because I lost some to my fingers and countertop while sprinkling.   NEVER have I had a better texture in a cheese sauce.  NOTES FOR SUCCESS:   The flour needs to be added very slowly, stirring all the while.   It will clump if added quickly.   Just resign yourself to the zen of it, and enjoy creating a masterpiece.   The flour mixture needs to be cooked long enough for it to thicken.  If you&#039;ve never made a roux or white sauce, try to find a video online.   That cooks out the flour taste and is also what thickens the sauce.   The cheese should not be packaged, pre-grated cheese.   The latter is coated with something to keep the strands separate, and it WILL effect the final outcome.   Lastly, if your heat is low enough, the cheese can be added in only two or three batches as long as you&#039;re constantly stirring.",5

I made a Mexican version using undrained Mexican chili beans in place of the cannelini beans.

Added 2 T. chili powder and 1/2 - 1 t. cumin with the veggies before adding the liquid to release some of their oils. I used a Kale Medley mix that I get at Sam&#039;s Club, that has spinach, chard and carrots added to it.

131018,pulled pork  crock pot,26,4,1110,335.1,10.0,72.0,24.0,80.0,10.0,8.0,51931,2015-11-29,"I am reviewing the recipe two ways.  One as written and one with a variation suggested by Doug MC.  Both reviews are for the pulled pork itself and its juices, not the pulled pork with the BBQ sauce since that would be totally subjective based on the type and brand of sauce preferred by each chef and a not good review of the recipe itself.  Also, I made the variation one first as I forgot the ginger ale, but had apples and apple cider vinegar on hand.

&quot;As Is&quot;  - 4 Stars:  Prepared as directed.  It was good and had I made this BEFORE the variation, I would have given it 5 stars as I&#039;ve never made pulled pork and wouldn&#039;t know any different.  The recipe was easy and delicious, but lacked some flavor and didn&#039;t WOW me like the variation recipe.  I used Pork Shoulder Butt (that&#039;s what the packaging said that I purchased from Kroger).  I couldn&#039;t find a 4 pound roast so I bought an 8 pounder and doubled the recipe.  I&#039;m not sure what flavoring the ginger ale gave it, but I couldn&#039;t taste it.  I cooked on low for 11 hours and the meat shredded easily, was super tender and juicy.  Like the variation recipe, we also took out the onions after cooking/shredding.  Also, we did not add the BBQ sauce to the meat and simmer in the crockpot.  Instead, I put the shredded pork back in the crockpot with its juices and let it soak it up on Warm.  Adding BBQ sauce to the meat and simmering is just not how my husband eats it in the south.  Plus, if I had eaten it using my husband?s sauce mixed throughout, I would have given it 2 stars.  I don?t like his sauce.  LOL.  Served for Thanksgiving Dinner with mashed potatoes, gravy from the pulled pork juices, and roasted asparagus.  My husband definitely gives this a thumbs up and likes it so this is a keeper.

&quot;Variation&quot; -  5 Stars:  Instead of the ginger ale, I wanted to try Doug?s recommendation of 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup apple cider since I had that on hand ? did not have smoke flavor and did not use it.  Everything else in the  original recipe stayed the same.  I have a juicer so I juiced a Granny Smith apple for fresh apple juice.  I also used Braggs Organic Apple Cider.  I Poured in 1 cup of each.  I put mine in the crockpot when I left for work around 6:30 am with onions on top and on the bottom.  By time I came home at 4:30 pm, the meat was falling off the bone.  I turned it off and pulled the pork with a fork.  It was so tender and juicy.  I couldn?t help myself and ate some without the BBQ Sauce.  It had a nice tang to it?.maybe the vinegar did that, I don?t know or the apples, but it had a different flavor than just the ginger ale recipe.  It was still amazing.  I gave some to my husband, but he didn?t like the onions because ?that?s not how they do it in the south where he?s from?, so I removed the onions and put the meat back in the crockpot and into the juices.  Since he is from the South and usually is served his pulled pork plain with the sauce on the side so he can pour it over the meat on his sandwich, that is exactly how I served it for dinner.   I heated the BBQ Sauce.  He used Famous Dave?s Devils Spit Sauce.  He has always HATED everything I have ever cooked in the crockpot so he wasn?t hopeful that it would be good.  On the contrary, he LOVED IT!!!!  Instead of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner this year, he asked for pulled pork ? MADE IN THE CROCKPOT!  Excellent variation to the original recipe.  Will definitely will be making this again.",5

I was looking for a an oven rib recipe and found this and glad I did cause it was so tasty!  My son loves ribs and I have never cooked or grilled bone in ribs before.  I had about 4 lbs of country style, bone in ribs, about 1 to 1/4 inch thick.  I had, on hand, Pampered Chef Smoky BBQ Rub which included the same rub ingredients mentioned here and I added that generously to each side of ribs.  I wrapped in the foil and refrigerated for about 3 hours. Pulled them out of fridge, sprinkled on some Liquid Smoke and added some sea salt and baked them at 300 degrees for about 2 hours 15 minutes.  Pulled out (very tender and falling off bone) and basted on Baby Ray&#039;s BBQ sauce (our fav too) and broiled as directed to get the sauce nicely caramelized.  We used forks, as my ribs were country style and not a rack; but it was tender and flavorful.  My son is not one to go looking for leftovers the next day but did with these ribs and luckily I had a few leftover.  I served this with a cheesy potato casserole and some green beans.

I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t reviewed it yet for as often as I make it.  I use 2 cups of puffed rice cereal (not Rice Krispies, but the plain ol&#039; puffed rice with a single ingredient of brown rice), 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and sometimes molasses instead of corn syrup.  Sometimes I use almond butter instead of peanut butter, so it could be made quite allergy-friendly.  As recommended, I mix everything except the mini chocolate chips (I tried full-size, and mini are better), let it cool slightly, then add the mini chips.  Oh yum yum yum!  It&#039;s still quite sweet, so I&#039;ve been playing with it, and I can replace some of the syrup/molasses with water with acceptable results.

The trick to good results is to PRESS the bars into the pan.  PRESS HARD.  The less air, the more likely it is to stay in bar form!  I use a piece of waxed paper to keep my hands (or lid) clean while pressing.  Next I pop the pan in the freezer to make the bars easier to slice.  I usually slice into 12 bars instead of 16 (too yummy to skimp) and wrap each one with press-n-seal (I&#039;ve been happiest with that for this).  Then I store the bars in the freezer until I need a snack.  And when I remember I have these in the freezer, I can feel the need to snack building up!  At least it&#039;s healthier (and cheaper) than so many other snack choices.

I&#039;m a huge fan of recipes that are flexible, meaning they can be used as a starting point to make something different.  Other dried fruit, nuts, coconut ... just imagine this with chopped almonds and coconut instead of raisins!  I&#039;m sure that would be awesome too!  This is the best kind of flexible recipe because I only measure the dry ingredients (fewer dishes to wash, and I just rinse after dry stuff), and I get good results eyeballing the sticky stuff.",5

We had buttermilk that needed to be used up so I searched the recipes for one we hadn&#039;t tried yet and this is what we came up with. Served them with either powdered sugar or real maple syrup.

I remember being introduced in my childhood while over at my neighbours house for lunch. I came across this recipe and decided to revive the old favourite and tried it as written. It is absolutely important to use home grown or the best quality tomatoes you can find in the store that are still on the vine. I used the miracle whip option but I must say I wasn&#039;t impressed. I&#039;m not really a mayo fan either (personal taste). For me, I like my tomato sandwich on fresh, untoasted buttered bread and a bit of salt and freshly ground pepper.

My family had this for a Cinco de Mayo/Supermoon party this year and it was a hit.  Like another reviewer said, they were sold on trying this by the story that went with it.  Loved it!!  I read somewhere that if you put the avocado pit in with the guacamole that it also helps it from turning brown along with the plastic wrap trick on laying it right on the dip.  I put a couple in and the next day it was still beautifully green.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!
UPDATE March 4, 2016: I found a new way to keep it fresh and green looking. When ready to store, forget the pit and plastic wrap technique. Instead, push down guacamole to get all the air out and smooth top. Add about 1/2&quot; of LUKEWARM water and close with a tight fitting lid. Sounds weird but it works. On the 3rd day it was still green. Do this every time you get out and use.",5

I also used 14 ounces of Ginger Ale, and cooked the roast over night for 12 hours on LOW, but by the next morning, the roast was far from being done, so I turned the roast over, covered it, and cooked on HIGH for another 2 hours. By then the roast was done. I cut the meat into bite size pieces, rather than shredding with 2 forks, and just added a few of the cooked onions back in with the meat, and discarded the remaining onions. Since there was lots of meat, I added an entire (28-ounce) bottle of Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s Original Barbecue Sauce. (Next time I&#039;m going to use Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s Sweet &amp; Spicy Barbecue Sauce, cause we like spicy.) After I added the barbecue sauce, I cooked for about 1-1/2 hours on LOW, so not to dry out the meat. I have noticed, when you cook meat on a LOW setting before serving, it never does get hot enough &#039;temp-wise&#039;, and so the meat was just warm, and not hot enough, but we still enjoyed the sandwiches. I&#039;m reheating leftovers in the microwave. Since I used a bigger roast, I found this made at least 15-16 sandwiches. One thing I did want to mention when making this recipe, I used a 6-quart crock-pot which only has 3 settings, On, LOW, and HIGH.

I also baked this a bit longer than called for, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Thank you Amanda for letting your Dad share this with the world!",5

I used Penzy's curry powder which was quite fresh, so the spices were wonderful. The raisins are a tasty sweet addition to the other spicy flavors (you could probably use dark raisins instead of the golden ones.) I added about 1/2 red bell pepper to the onion, and that made it pretty much a one-dish meal (if you count peppers as a vege.) A side of rice and sliced tomato was all it took to complete the plate.

I took advice from other reviewers and cut up the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and doubled the sauce. Also, I find that chicken breast can get dry and tough when fried, so I changed the cooking procedure to this recipe by first sauteing the chicken pieces and then adding the remaining ingredients directly into the frying pan with the chicken still in the pan. I boiled down the sauce and stirred the chicken in the sauce frequently. That worked out well, as the chicken pieces absorbed some of the sauce and were fork-tender when done. My kids and husband asked me to make this recipe again. There is something missing to this sauce, though--maybe pineapple or orange juice? I'll be making this again and will find out. I served this meal with white rice and black beans (the Goya recipe on the back of the Goya black beans can; it's the best black bean recipe). I will use this recipe often!",5

Next time I may try subbing all the oil for butter, but I really liked it with half butter, half oil! I also like this method of mixing half the flour first and then the rest as it needs it. This made it a lot easier for me to mix than just throwing all the flour in all at once. I let the dough have a full first rise (it took only maybe 40 minutes because my ingredients were warmer than lukewarm; so my dough rose quickly!) and I ended up making 32 rolls! So many rolls!

I'd never tried biscuits before, as being from Australia, they are not a common thing. We do have the similar but sweet British scones, which are served with jam and cream. I used the food processor like the author, and found it to be easy. I did find the wet dough hard to work with as it kept sticking to my hands. I'd be grateful for any tips on this. I was also not sure if you are supposed to flatten the dough again between each fold. Like another reviewer stated, the ones I pieced together from the leftover dough turned out better than the first ones, which makes me think that a little kneading may be ok. I may have flattened the dough a little too much before cutting because mine weren't super tall. This may have partly been due to the cutter I used which was a Tupperware double sided one, where it has two different sized circles on each side. I used the bigger side, but it probably pressed the cut rounds down too much. I know an old trick with scones is to actually use a small drinking glass to cut the rounds and keep them nice and high. Mine cooked a little too fast, which I was prepared for as my oven runs hot. The taste was buttery and savoury, which was strange being used to sweet scones, but not unpleasant. This recipe is probably not something I'll make again but I enjoyed trying them.",3

On tasting, I felt the soup was a little bland, so I ended up using triple the spices and added 1 1/2 Tbs of worchestershire sauce. I also added about 1 1/2 Tbs of chicken soup base and 1/2 Tbs of sugar. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I did not find the soup overly salty and even added another 1/2 tsp of salt. When cooking, I sauteed the celery and carrots with some garlic while I was browning the ground beef, mixed the seasonings with the sauteed veggies and the beef, before mixing everything together and simmering for 30 minutes. I added the peas and corn with the pasta and simmered for another 15 minutes before turning off the heat and letting the soup sit for another 15 minutes. To finish with my changes, I did not add any parmesan at the end (my kids don't like it). The result was frankly something that we all liked, but didn't love.

I also cut the breasts in half to make them more equal thickness (doubtful you'll ever get a matching pair, haha!). I also used a wire rack above cookie sheet for airflow and keeping meat out of juices. These are things I do for almost every b/s breast recipe! I take for granted these adjustments.

The meatballs, which were mixed and rolled with the help of my 7 year old son (he had a ball) came out perfectly, flavourful and tender. I followed the recipe to a tee and served them with spaghetti. I don't know why some commenters are so worried about broiling or cooking the meatballs first. You don't need to, it's just a waste of valuable time. Mine stayed together just fine. The trick, I think is to make the meatballs first and let them sit for a bit while you start the sauce so the breadcrumbs can absorb the egg and juices which in my opinion helps bind them together. Also, just gently drop each ball into the sauce and don't stir for a while until they are cooked. The raw meatballs, as I read in another comment are also supposed to help flavour the sauce as they cook. I can certainly agree with that. I am keeping this recipe to make again and I will continue to make it as written. This is one of those very rare meals that pleases everyone in my fussy family.",5

I made fresh bread crumbs and just threw the shredded Parmesan into the processor with the bread so it would have a texture similar to the grated.

I read that cookies put in fridge bake better - and due to timing left in fridge overnight. When I baked them cold - they STUCK to the pan - so need to use parchment if you are going to cool the dough. They were not flat - did not spread and were thicker and chewier due to the cold dough. (which we like). UPDATE: I've made these about 8 times now - and use all the sugar all the time... I've begun to soak and plump my craisins too-- thanks for that suggestion! Everyone LOVES these cookies!!! I used my cookie scooper and had no trouble with flattening cookies or too plump cookies. I got 28 cookies and 12 minutes was a good time - except after the cookie sheets were hot - the second round in the oven (last few cookies) got a bit overdone - probably should reduce a minute or two if using the cookie sheets a second time... UPDATE to the UPDATE - Turn down the oven a bit and cook them a bit longer so the butter doesn't melt and spread out and make flat / ugly cookies....,5

I always use old fashioned oats pulsed in my coffee grinder a bit, and I often use a mixture of rice crispy cereal and plain cheerios (those cereals that languish in the pantry toward the end of the box LOL). You can totally make these in the microwave; I mix the nut butter, honey, and about 1/4 sugar and microwave for about 45 seconds, stir, then pop it back in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Easy peasy and dangerously quick! The only major tweak I make every time is one I highly recommend--if you use natural nut butters, add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the dry ingredients.

It is a great starter recipe you can easily customize to anyone's tastes. My kids tend to prefer blander foods that don't have too many ingredients so I make it pretty much according to the recipe, but I am able to add green olives, chopped grilled eggplant, etc. to mine. Corn and diced bell peppers are also good in this. Great way to sneak in some leftover veggies, too. And it goes without saying that this stretches a lb. of hamburger meat like nobody's business!

These pork chops were full of good flavor - in fact, I think I'll sprinkle a little less of the salt seasoning on it next time - and were super simple/hands-off. I thought the turning off of heat and covering was a great way to finish the chops. Mine did come out a bit too dry so next time, I'll do it for a little less time. I used boneless chops - that may have been the reason. Thank you for the added tip at the end. I deglazed the pan with some leftover chicken broth and threw in a little butter.

It was a bit on the small side, so I cut back on the seasonings a little bit, but I didn't need to. I could have taken all of it and still not been too salty, thanks to the salt being kosher salt. At first, when the crock pot heated up, it smelled like heaven, then, when it got closer to the 8 hour time, it started to smell like maybe it was starting to burn or something akin to that, but all was well when I took it out. I did cook it on the low heat setting, so shouldn't have worried. In fact, I highly recommend using the low setting and refrigerating it overnight, so you can remove the fat from the drippings (assuming you plan to add them back to the meat.) There was LOT of fat left in the juices. The taste of this was simply wonderful, but you could easily mix it up with different flavors and have it come out great. I'll use this meat for sandwiches, burritos, even omelets or fritattas. It would be good over rice or potatoes as well. I put a couple portions in the freezer, and will have another for dinner tomorrow. (I did taste it before putting in the fridge.) This is a keeper for sure.",5
