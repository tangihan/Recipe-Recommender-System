My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"It was absolute blast with the Fishing Frenzy Academy. We had an exceptional experience learning how to tie knots and how to set up a fishing rod at the basic course. Aloysius was very friendly and knowledgeable, being a avid fisherman for many years now. He was very willing to share his knowledge with all of us at the class; young, old and experienced fishers too!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Brought my son along to learn the very basics of fishing and Aloysius of MFFA didn't disappoint. The explanation/guidebook was very detailed and actually managed to clear many doubts I have about basic fishing equipment/setup/techniques.
After this lesson, fishing doesn't seem to daunting anymore. Even my 8 year old son managed to catch 2 small fishes:). Definitely would recommend MFFA for those who wants to try out fishing but overwhelmed by the amount of equipment and techniques.
Finally, what's admirable is that MFFA also promotes sustainable and humane fishing by teaching us how to fish with least damage to fishes and encourage catch and release especially for juvenile and rare fishes. Kudos!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"The Beginner Angler's Course is perfect for learning the basics and getting started with fishing! My friend and I had an amazing time when we went for this course during the holidays. We are both complete newbies to fishing, but learned to assemble the fishing rod, attach the bait and catch fish through this course. Both of us successfully managed to catch our first fish at the Lazarus Island jetty. The weather was great, ambience was so nice and peaceful, and was an overall very relaxing and enjoyable experience!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Went for Novice Anglers and Intermediate and had a blast. Fished at southern island with a bunch of other eager novice anglers and we all had a great time.
Then the intermediate was a smaller group in the boat. And we had a whale of a time,  Cap and crew were fantastic. Taught us how to catch bait fish while at the jetty and at sea. Caught a couple groupers and all in all was a great experience."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I attended the beginner angler's course and it was a very enriching experience. The instructors were very encouraging and helpful in guiding the participants to learn how to tie the knots. At the same time, they also shared their personal experiences with fishing. Overall, it is an enjoyable course that is suitable for adults and children. I definitely am hooked on fishing now."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"It was a great experience having the ability to actually learn how to fish! Everything was done meticulously so that you have the basic knowledge and know how to fish. From how to tie a hook, your lines and even how to feel for a bite. It was simply amazing! Huge hats off to Mr Rainey who taught me!!!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Attending the Beginner course with MFFA helped to reconnect with a hobby that I had left behind for years. Had a great time with my instructor, Raymond, who I affectionally call ""Master Shifu"" these days, and learnt everything from scratch again. I've since completed the Novice phase and have embarked on the Intermediate course to better hone my fishing skills. Every trip with MFFA has been a joy and wonderful learning experience. Thank you Shifu Raymond and Skipper Fidos for always being generous with your knowledge and patience with this growing angler!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Signed up for the Beginner Angler Course for my Son and I. He is turning 10 and always interested to learn to fish but I didn’t know how and where to start.

The course was structured and organized really well with opportunity for hands on experience preparing the rod, line and lures. Lazarus island was like a mini getaway and very calm peaceful place for fishing. We successfully caught a few small fishes and my Son is hooked.

Have since signed up for thier next course - Beginner angler  course which will be on a boat!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I brought my boyfriend on the basic fishing course, I found on klook. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip, it was a beautiful day and we learned so much. I even learned how to better make knots! We have continued to fish even after that!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Personally I had enjoyed this short and simple fishing trip. My grandson also enjoyed the feeling of learning to set up the fishing rod and line, hooks and tackle. Got the real experience to fish after the lesson. Quite a value for money trip although we managed to just hook up few small fishes."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"My friends and I went for the 1 day BEGINNER ANGLER'S COURSE. The day started off early in the morning at Marina South Pier where we met with the instructor and got ourselves a private charter boat to Lazarus/St john Island. Once there, the instructor set us down and guided us through very patiently everything a newbie would need to know from different types of material of the rod, types of fishes commonly found among our shores and which is venomous, typing of hooks, setting up the fishing rod (which was provided) to be ready to fish by ourselves, all the way to how to hook and fight a fish properly. The instructor was a pretty funny guy so the lesson was not one bit boring at all haha. We then went on to do some fishing with his guidance near at beautiful shoreline of Lazarus Island and we all manage to catch some fishes for ourselves albeit most were small fishes but it was EXCITING to finally able to land a fish by ourselves. Some of us even caught some exotic looking fishes!
Overall, although I had some basic fishing experience myself,  I still find value in this course and learnt many things that day(like how to properly fight a fish, why use a leader, how to properly tie main line to swivel etc..) and would highly recommend anyone who might want to start fishing for the first time or even just to get to know more about fishing to join the course as I understand it can be quite daunting to learn all of these by yourself when there is so much different information out on the internet and you have no idea where to even start from. They even offer follow-up courses after the beginner courses and needless to say my friends and I are already planning to go for it :)
We all become addicts to fishing after the course haha."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Aloysius was the instructor for the beginner course - he was knowledgeable and approachable! The beginner course is great for those who want to get their feet wet in fishing. Fishing location was a pontoon off Pulau Seringat, a part of Lazarus Island."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I am very interested in taking up fishing as a hobby however I do not know how to start or where to start from. I found MFFA online giving courses for beginners, I told myself this is it and I immediately register myself for the course.

On the course date, I went to Lazarus island meet my instructor, Mark and a group of interesting course-mates. Mark teaches us the different components of the fishing rods, reels , knots for tying hooks etc.After that we started our practical fishing, managed to hook up some small fishes. Even though the fish is small but I’m just so happy as I finally learnt how to fish.Released the small fishes back to the sea to let them grow bigger.Times flies quickly and it came to the end of the class.

Strongly recommend for beginners that are interested in fishing if you do not know how to start."
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,Went with my wife using the sg rediscover voucher to attend the BAC. Learnt the basic of fishing and also at the same time went to a new/discover place. Trainer (Aloysius) is quite helpful and patience to teach beginners from the very start.
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Signed up BAC class for my children . They enjoyed the course very much . The instructors are friendly , helpful and patient . Thumbs up for the instructors . Affordable course with great instructors’ guidance, a must do activities for all children . Thank you MFFA :)"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I signed up for a Beginner Angler’s Course with my 8 year old son as he’d always been interested in fishing. It was a great trip, and one that I would recommend any parents. The instructors (yes, not just one instructor but a few, each instructing a smaller group) were great, and my son not just learnt the basics but also managed to catch two fish. That definitely made his day! In fact everyone who went on the same course didn’t go home empty handed, with everyone landing at least one fish! Raymond Ang was the instructor assigned to my group and he was really patient with children. He was also clear in his explanation and all of us have little trouble tying our own setup. I am planning on signing up for the Novice Angler’s Course next with my son for another rendezvous to sea!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"During my first lesson with MFFA, I learnt the basics of tying a knot and getting a feel for bites when the fishes are eating the bait. With this understanding well thought by the instructors, I attended the next course involving boat fishing which paid of extremely well. All of us caught big fishes (at least 2kg). It was really enjoyable and very informative. Overall I believe MFFA has succeeded in not only equipping me with the knowledge and skill but most importantly loving fishing. Thank you!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I am in my seventies and have been fishing for years; and for ‘years’ I mean since I started in my early twenties. I am not very good at it though, and it could have been my (lack of) skills, or my inability to hunt down good fishing holes - regardless, I just don’t have very good luck when it comes to fishing and have sort of ‘come to terms’ with that.

My daughter insisted that I likely do not know the correct techniques and signed me up for the Intermediate Fishing Course. I was reluctant to go for the course initially but was persuaded by the opportunities to go fishing out at sea after I sold my fishing boat.

It was a GAME CHANGER! My fishing kakis who laughed at the prospect of me joining a fishing course and learning how to fish after having fished for so many years are now all silenced! Not only did I start landing fish now, I am landing fish of decent sizes. This is not pure luck, but good ‘insider knowledge’ that I would never have master had I not joined the course.

Now my trips out to sea saw me on the ‘leaderboard’ compared to my kakis in the same boat, and I must say that it was money well spent. Am I contemplating joining the Advanced class? You bet I am!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"Very interesting experience out there. I've least expected it to be so... soul fulfilling. I got a better understanding of nature, the cycle, while feeling the tension of my line deep in the sea and I'm in the middle of everything, under floating white clouds (which I felt like they represented my thoughts back then).

5 stars mffa! I love your fun instructors too. :) I'm truly grateful for the experience!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,Our instructors were so helpful and all of us learnt how to fish pretty fast. He even took us to a second spot to fish when the first place got too noisy with the party boats. It was a nice afternoon on Lazarus island and the place was so scenic. Just remember to bring mosquito repellent!
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,"I took my 5 year old to the novice fishing class at Lazarus Island. We had a blast and the instructors did a great job making sure that everyone had a good time. A very professional team and the whole experience (from the fun boat ride out) to the catching of some fish was great. Strongly recommended as a starter class with kids.

Note: Mosquito repellant is a must. They are quite ferocious!"
My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,Professional and friendly staff

My Fishing Frenzy Academy,5,
The Olde Cuban,5,"Great service and amazing selection of cigars and whisky.

Love this place but not cheap so be prepared to splurge!

Food is also decent."
The Olde Cuban,5,A great place to chill out with a dram of whisky and cigars
The Olde Cuban,2,"Place doesn't look good at all. Hard to find and you get into this really old 60s lift that fits 2 people. Looks good when you arrive but it goes downhill when you walk through the door into the cigar lounge. It's fine to smoke a cigar but if you want a nicer ambience, I have seen better cigar bars. This place has the atmosphere of a seedy opium den! It doesn't have to be high end but they could try to create a nicer atmosphere for what are expensive cigars."
The Olde Cuban,5,"Good service
Nice drink
Not cheap but reasonable"
The Olde Cuban,5,"Very unique plus exquisite venue to come across.
Decently quiet hence not easy to locate.

Pleasure to visit the place for the whiskey and nicely done Japanese food"
The Olde Cuban,5,"2nd time new 3rd floor new food , good service, costly but cigar and whisky stylish."
The Olde Cuban,5,Beautiful place n staffs
The Olde Cuban,4,"A great place to purchase cigar, to enjoy it, and find a great fit whisky there.

Walking distance from China town mrt station, on pagoda street. Need to go from side door to take the lift up(now there’s construction on the street, whole street store seems closed, but cigar bar is open still, open you would over heard some noice from the street)

The waiter/waitress has a great service, they will go through all the product with you. You can tell them your budget, purpose of he gift, what flavor or location or brand you like then they chose for you.

You can find some limit edition with a beautiful tube here. Very suitable gift for good friend or boss. Their box cigar usually on sales. If you buy more than 4 cigars they might offer you 15% discount.

Unfortunately, they don’t have flavor cigar like chocolate or vanilla. I wish them can import some tho."
The Olde Cuban,4,Very wide selection of whiskey. You can sample various ones at a small fee. But the wine by the glass selection is very limited. Need to go by bottles if you want other variety. Cannot BYO cigar. Need to buy theirs.
The Olde Cuban,5,Cool ambience with great selection of good drinks. They have one of the best whiskey!
The Olde Cuban,3,Nice variety of up scale cigars & whisky. No smoking or drinking on site due to Covid. Only buy & take away. Ok service
The Olde Cuban,1,"Not an honorable place. My friends and I called them at 730 on a Friday night and told them we wld be coming before 9 to buy some take aways. We left bedok and called them again while on the way at 830pm. Chinese sounding lady said OK. Will wait for us. When we arrived at 845, they rejected us at the door.

Granted their closing time is at 9 but they should honor their word that they would be waiting. We didn't come beyond 9 also and wanted to buy to take away. Would nvr do business with such people who can't honor their word. Wasted our trip down. We could have gone to quiach bar at South Beach instead."
The Olde Cuban,5,I came across this place by chance while traveling in Singapore. It's amazing. The lounge associate was fantastic! Very attentive and thoughtful with service and recommendations. I highly recommend it. Excellent decor and relaxing ambiance. Cocktails and killer cigars.
The Olde Cuban,5,"Nice environment, friendly and helpful staff, great cigars and whisky."
The Olde Cuban,5,"My favorite cigar lounge in all of Singapore. Great selection of smokes with comfy seating and great friendly local service. If you ask nicely and pledge to be a frequent customer, they may let you go up stairs to the private lounge where the service and selection is even better. Buy a bottle of Scotch and have the bar maid write your name on it and drink it whenever you're in town."
The Olde Cuban,1,Doesn’t open till mentioned timing. Called for order. Arrived at door 15 mins before closing. Asked to turn away. Don’t deal with them.
The Olde Cuban,5,"Nice cigar lounge. Hidden in Chinatown, Singapore. Thank you Kim for an awesome experience!"
The Olde Cuban,5,"Great place to relax with a cigar and a drink. A little hard to find, but well worth the search. Cigars are fresh. I little expensive, but not out of line with Singapore standards. Very good selection. Welcoming staff. I would definitely return."
The Olde Cuban,3,"Was not impressed with the place. Got an OK selection of cigar, good selection of whisky but it doesn't feel cozy or friendly to sit in."
The Olde Cuban,5,"Food - Place for cigars, whisky. You can order zi char and snacks, which comes from the downstairs Chinatown Seafood Restaurant. They have now their own Japanese kitchen and dining area.
Ambience - Chill and relaxing.
Price - $$$"
The Olde Cuban,5,hidden gem in chinatown heart. cozy and discreet. so many cigars options and spirits. nice place to spend the night.
The Olde Cuban,4,High end joint ..great place to meet the movers and shakers
The Olde Cuban,5,"The entrance to this fine establishment is hard to find, so keep your eyes open as you walk the pedestrian-only Pagoda Street, full of hawkers and shops.   Given the setting, ""The Olde Cuban"" is everything you would expect from an upscale cigar place in Singapore--but it is far more than you might expect.

Inside are the typical leather chairs, dark hardwood walls, and member-only rooms that you might expect in finer cigar clubs.  But inside, the you find probably 200 different varieties of Scotch, the main drink offered.  While enjoying this fine inner establishment, you might occasionally glance out the window and see the red lanterns and remember, rather shockingly, that you are in the middle of a 9-million member sovereign state comprised of ethnic Chinese, Malay and former British royalty.  Highly recommend.  But do not tell too many of your tourist friends."
The Olde Cuban,5,Relax place with lots of private rooms. They are very relax on their rules.. you can even just have beer or smoke your own cigarettes. However will recommend their cigars and whiskey. Finger food is good as well.
The Olde Cuban,5,"Great hidden place . . .

this is on a second floor, and some of the people below don't even know it is there. It looks tiny, until you realize the bar is non-smoking and there are several private rooms. You are given a private room where they close the door (after they get your drinks/food). It says ""No Smoking By Law"" in each room, but they bring you cigars and ashtrays, and there's a big filtration system in each room. highly recommended."
The Olde Cuban,1,"I’m very disappointed at this place. The first thing as I worked in I was told that they do not have the license for us to smoke within the premises.
They would provide me with ashtray and lighter if I choose to do so but it is entirely illegal.
Why is a place promoting itself as a cigar lounge doesn’t have the legal status to allow people to smoke in the.

Sum it up, I’m disappointed"
The Olde Cuban,1,One of the worst cigar bars worldwide I‘ve been. The rooms are uncomfortable and anything than cozy. On some pics there is a balcony: not real. Do not waste your valuable time to go there... absolutely no Cuban atmosphere.
The Olde Cuban,4,Nice friendly atmosphere for smoking a cigar
The Olde Cuban,5,"let's be clear Cigars in Singapore are expensive, ridiculously expensive so expect no less here. Scotch is comparable to other areas,so with that said you pay for ambiance and service. The lounge is nice and cigars are well cared for unlike other places in the area. $230 after 2 sticks and a few glasses of 16-18 he scotch. To find pagoda st, large ""seafood"" restaurant on the corner, duck in and go upstairs. On a side note they share space with Archipelago Brewing who's does a fine job with craft beer."
The Olde Cuban,4,Cozy place where I hang out for cigar puffing. Good selection of single malt scotch.  Just pricy as hell.   Well that's the price tag for these seductive in Singapore.
The Olde Cuban,5,Great place to have private events and chill.. esp whiskey and cigar lovers..Great staffs too..!
The Olde Cuban,4,Nice place to chill and have cigar n wine
The Olde Cuban,3,"Olde Cuban offers cigars, whiskey and leather seats nicely tucked away in Chinatown. The real plus is that you get local food. We managed to get a room to ourselves (as we were quite a large group) and it was quite cozy. However, the service was lacking. It's not that the service was slow but rather they were too attentive. And kept looking to pour more from the bottle into the glasses. That just ticks me off."
The Olde Cuban,1,"Terrible service. I went with a mate to enjoy a highball and glass of wine. We were given a table for 4 as the place wasn't busy with hardly any tables taken. It took 20 minutes to deliver 1 highball and 1 glad of wine, with a waitress that seemed bothered that we were disturbing her quiet night. My friend ordered another wine, 20 minutes later it still hasn't come and the waitress bright over a family of 4 people and asked us to move to a table for 2. There were 2 other tables for 6 available but she felt she had to move us to accommodate this family. We decided to leave. The bill was provide for 2 wines and a highball. Expect bad service"
The Olde Cuban,1,They do t have a cigar lecense so will sell them but will not let you smoke them there....unless you have a membership so useless for tourists. Don't waste your time going there
The Olde Cuban,5,"I went there to buy a cigar as a gift for a friend and I can really recommend this shop if you are looking for all kinds of cigars or spirits.
Even though I am not a smoker, I would suggest you to go there just to have a glimpse into the diversity of cigars from all over the world."
The Olde Cuban,4,"Nice bar, lot of cigars and whiskey. Unfortunately it seems not all whiskeys are really available. However this is like a hidden gem in China Town."
The Olde Cuban,5,Unique experience - great food and Exceptional range of Scotch
The Olde Cuban,5,"Very good selection of whisky. Nice and attentive service. A bit pricy but this is because of SG taxes, I guess. But overall, I really like this place. Will visit again."
The Olde Cuban,5,"For the lovers of cigars, wines, beers. Stop looking further. This is the right spot for all your indulgence needs.

Located at the second level of ""Chinatown Seafood"" along Pagoda Street(Closed Street with shophouses), take the lift located at the seafood restaurant to the 2nd level and you will find nostalgia in the ambience of the bar.

Be prepared for a great night! Speak to any of their friendly service staffs for a superb recommendation on their cigar range."
The Olde Cuban,4,Hard to find but it’s amazing place
The Olde Cuban,4,"The whisky collection available here is insane. Massive selection of Cubans as well, which are reasonably priced for Singapore (which is expensive for tobacco in Asia).

The staff are friendly, the lounge is very comfortable and it's in a vibrant location in China Town. If you like fanatic whisky and exceptionally kept cigars then stop in and try this place out.."
The Olde Cuban,5,"Unbelievable spirits list (Whiskey, rum, etc), fantastic selection of fine cigars and super helpful staff - very attentive. This is a must go to place in Singapore!"
The Olde Cuban,5,Staff are all nice and accomodating.
The Olde Cuban,1,"This place is very 'classist' and does discriminate. A lot of favouritism, etc. in dealing with customers - this is not a good place to go to if you want to be treated as an equal, with kindness."
The Olde Cuban,5,Nice environment with great cigars and whisky. A great place for cigar lovers.
The Olde Cuban,5,Nice place with good variety of cigars and whisky to choose from.
The Olde Cuban,5,Good place to meet friends who love cigars.
The Olde Cuban,1,"Really disappointed, arrogant waitress, terrible customer service. They act judgemental and look down to people. In the end of my visit, they didn’t even greet us."
The Olde Cuban,4,It's very unique cigar-bar in Singapore. The Chinatown is very noisy and crowded but this place (in the Chinatown) is very calm and cozy.
The Olde Cuban,5,A very good place if like a nice quiet place to drink and have a cigar
The Olde Cuban,5,"It has a relaxed vibe, with a wide range of whiskeys and cigars. I've been there a number of times now and service has always been attentive."
The Olde Cuban,5,Large sélection of cigars and spirits. Great spot to meet up with mates.
The Olde Cuban,5,A jewel for Cigar Lovers in the heart of Chinatown. Sulerb selections of cigars with genrous selection of good Whiskey.
The Olde Cuban,5,Fantastic place to be with friends and great smokes.
The Olde Cuban,5,100 % top
The Olde Cuban,4,Service is good but the ventilation needs improvement
The Olde Cuban,5,"Top notch cigars, amazing whiskey."
The Olde Cuban,4,Good place for whiskey and cigar 👍👍👍👍👍 very comfortable and good place to wind down
The Olde Cuban,5,The best cigar bar in Singapore!
The Olde Cuban,3,Still good but getting expensive
The Olde Cuban,4,Best cigar lounge in town.
The Olde Cuban,5,Great vibes. Epic smokes
The Olde Cuban,1,Like going back to the days of the prohibition. Very bad
The Olde Cuban,5,Best place for cigar
The Olde Cuban,5,Best Cigar selections in town
The Olde Cuban,4,Nice range of rum and whiskey

Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,Beautiful heritage building even from the outside.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,4,Amazing miniature showing old days of the area. Love it! Reviews I have read before visiting did not give an impression on the temple’s size. In fact it is quite tiny.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,"Lovely miniature display of how life was in the 1820s! Life was hard in those days though...note the coolies around the back taking a break from hauling people around on his rickshaw.
Amazing to see this beautiful temple right downtown, and interesting how you can walk through the beautiful timber and stone structure...to get to the AMOY hotel and a Japanese restaurant!"
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,"Singapore's oldest temple was dedicated to Tua Pek Kong. it has now been converted into a museum. Besides that it has integrated into part of a boutique hotel. In the Museum, you will be able to browse over 200 artifacts donated by residents in Chinatown, which will give you a glimpse into the way of life of the early immigrants."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,It’s soooo small. But absolutely adorable. Go there it’s free. What a contrast to the bustling city around.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,4,Small museum showing old days lives in Singapore. The building used to the one of the oldest Chinese temple founded by immigrants from China in 19th century.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,2,"According to the plaque at the entrance, this temple is one of the oldest around since the 1820s. The temple, founded by the Hakka and Cantonese immigrants, served as a place of worship and a social meeting place for the two communities. The temple was closed in 1994 and has since been converted into a museum.

Inside, you can find a diorama depicting a street scene outside the temple with the early immigrants going about their daily life. If you are wondering why there is a pier with boats docking along it, that is because this place used to be a coastal area. Much of Telok Ayer is built on reclaimed land.

In fact, the name Telok Ayer actually means ""Water Bay""."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,"A quaint and small museum directly next to Amoy Hotel, of the early days of Chinese immigrants in Singapore. Not much to see, except that it offers a peek of how shophouses used to be back in the days."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,Nice little area for a quick rest stop to see the minatures of old Singapore
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,A nice little place to pass by and take a few photos
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,4,It's quite sad that there's no more introduction of the folk religions of this temple. But luckily the temple is still remained.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,Not a big place. Connect to a hotel.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,If you pass by...
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,"Tiny museum commemorating Chinese immigrant life in Singapore. The diorama is amazing. Drop in if you're nearby, but not worth a special trip."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,Chinese temple and museum
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,"Tiny place that showcases miniatures of early Chinese immigrants in Singapore. Although small, I have to say that it is rather interesting."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,"A history of Singapore is capture here.

Was the shore line of earlier sea at the door step.... Beyond is reclaimed land. Explore...!"
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,Great little museum if you care to look
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,Merged with Amoy Hotel.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,4,"A historic Temple turned into the facade of a hotel. The museum is very small, probably takes one minute to see everything."
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,Small but nice museum to learn more about Chinese in Singapore
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,It's a small temple converted into a musuem filled with small figurines depicting life in Singapore decades ago. It's recommended for a visit if you're around the area!
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,ßmall but nice place. Historic and pretty displays in the heart of the city
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,Very small place...but nice.
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,3,It's more like a entrance to a food court now... Like a passage
Fuk Tak Chi Museum,4,Great place to visit.

Fuk Tak Chi Museum,5,Very attractive

With the surge in donations from the believers, Ford was able to switch to masonry in 1825 and then undergone several rounds of renovation. The great renovation in 1869 was completed by Cheung Hong Lim, a Fujian-based community leader. Later, Ford became the home base of the Guangdong and Hakka communities, and even played the role of a welfare association, becoming a venue for dispute resolution.
However, in the 1990s, the rich and colorful Fude Temple began to decline, and the temple was seriously in disrepair. Later, Ford was
The government took over and the altar was moved to a temple in Geylang. The original site of Ford is from China and Malaysia. 
The craftsman repaired it and turned it into a museum in 1998. Today's Ford is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Fortunately, there is a model in the pavilion that depicts the scene around the early years of Ford, allowing visitors to understand the Tel Ayer Street at the time.

福德祠原是一座庙宇，主要供奉儒家和道家信众所信仰的大伯公 (Tua Pek Kong) 。福德祠由广东和客家移民在 1820 年和至 1824 年间出资建设，不少华人移民都来此膜拜大伯公，感谢神明护佑他们平安抵达新加坡。
随着信众捐赠款额剧增，福德祠得以在 1825 年改用砖石重建，之后还经过多轮翻修。 1869 年的那次大翻修，是福建人社区领袖章芳林 (Cheang Hong Lim) 出资完成，后来，福德祠成为广东和客家社群的大本营，甚至发挥了福利协会的作用，成为解决争端的场所。
但是到了 20 世纪 90 年代，拥有丰富多彩历史的福德祠开始走向没落，庙宇严重失修。后来，福德祠被
政府接管，里头的神坛被迁移至位于芽笼 (Geylang) 的一座神庙。福德祠原址则由来自中国和马来西亚

La Maison du Whisky,3,"Ordered a bottle of Starward Single Cask Release from LMDW. Delivered quickly, but box came dented, contacted customer service to seek an exchange for the box. Had to go down to their store personally to get the new box. Collected a free sample of Bunnahabhain 5 while I was at the store. Service was decent."
La Maison du Whisky,4,"Came here on a late Monday evening, it was pretty quiet but service was good, non intrusive and gave us privacy. The pricing like mentioned by others are quite steep, averaging at $28 per drink. Atmosphere is lovely, dimly lit and cozy. If you're looking for somewhere sexy and fancy bring your date in the area, this might be it!"
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Best Whisky and Cocktail Bar in Singapore!
The staff is very friendly with good advises.  Excellent cocktail but also very large choice of rare whiskies. Great time there!"
La Maison du Whisky,4,Quite a nice place for whisky and other liquors.
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Great little bar. Good whisky selection, some good gins, great traditional cocktails, and very friendly service. Highly recommended."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Very good to back at my trusted whisky place of Zen.
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Great selection of whiskys, awesome vibe at night sitting outside. Staff are fun to talk to and super friendly!"
La Maison du Whisky,5,Amazing selection of whisky.
La Maison du Whisky,4,"Some really rare whiskey finds here. Prices are pretty steep, but expected"
La Maison du Whisky,5,"I love this place for it's variety and quality of spirits. I visit during retail hours whenever I'm in Singapore. The staff is very helpful. If what you're looking for is not in the store they can check if it's in their warehouse so you can come back for it.

I say retail hours as they open their bar at 6 or 7pm. But you can taste some of what's available even though it's not bar hours.

This is a wonderland for spirits geeks. They have quality stuff from Mezcal to rum to whisky to brandy."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Amazing product variety and selection of whiskeys, staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We had a great time there"
La Maison du Whisky,5,Premium drinks. Impeccable service. Fancy place in the heart of Robertson quay. The staff really take care of you. Love it!
La Maison du Whisky,5,"The best bar I've been to in Singapore. With the wide range of collection and excellent service by the staff. Wanting to satisfy my palate has never been an issue with them.  Two thumbs up , worth the visit."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Definitely one of the more accommodating and comfortable places for you to hang out. Experienced bartenders, impeccable service, and make awesome cocktails according to your tastes."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Probably the best whisky bar in the world. Atmosphere is on the casual side and staff are super helpful and knowledgeable. <3 Joe and crew
La Maison du Whisky,1,"The choice is OK, but service is always terrible. Unfriendly, arrogant, incompetent.  This time, at 2:30 in the afternoon, we entered the shop, WHICH WAS OPEN, and were told unceremoniously to get out as the shop was closed and they wouldn’t sell anything to us for another 30 minutes... This is actually totally in character: pretentious and unfriendly: If you are looking for friendly service and feel good experience, just go somewhere else. The staff does great disservice to management, who offer decent products."
La Maison du Whisky,1,"terrible experience, service staff is so arrogant, i left with a mix feeling of humiliation and embarrassment.  they treated my friends with utmost disrespect, they compensate me with free drinks, well free drinks doesn't compensate the damage caused to the relation i had with the person i invited there. There is better whisky bar in Singapore, with a real sens of service. my advice if your about to bring someone for  business  or friend to that bar think twice, maybe you should considerate a real japans  bar. the drinks are the same, or even better, service is professional."
La Maison du Whisky,2,"Not great anymore. I used to come here alot back in the day, but boy has things changed!

The service is still good, but the prices are seriously off the charts now. Extremely expensive. The cheapest whisky you'd get now is around S$30 + taxes. If you want the really good stuff, be ready to pay through your nose.

Selection is still decent, although the menu had been reduced quite a bit. Buying by the glass is definitely NOT worth it. Regular bottles are still OKAY priced, but still expensive.

To top it off, they don't have a smoking license anymore (I used to smoke cigars here, drink rum and whisky with pals). Smoking may not be a thing for most patrons, so I guess that ok.

All in all, not worth the visit, prices are way too high for what they serve (many other competitively priced bars in the area or just slightly further out, do your research). I won't be coming back here anymore."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Excellent collection and out of the world service. I am not a whiskey drinker myself but collect. Stayed in Singapore about 2 minutes away but never discovered them. When I moved out of Singapore and was looking for some nice single malts in Singapore- found them online. Have bought twice in the last 2 months. The choice and the recommendation have been amazing - at least that's what the people who come home have told me.

The service is another level. Special shout out to Sarah."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Amazing place to check out some great whisky and tons of other selections.  It was here that I was taught about mezcal, now my favourite drink.   There is alot of high end stuff here that you might fall in love with, so be cautious before you try that fancy stuff- you might not be able to look back.   Very friendly staff here as well, GREAT ambiance."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Best home bar ever. Gotta love being surrounded by whiskey in the company of the people who appreciate whiskey too.
La Maison du Whisky,5,"A fine collection of whiskeys. You'll likely be able to find that rare bottle you've been searching or in the least be able to find something new and exciting to try out.

I'm a big fan of Islay Scotch, Japanese Whiskey, and Kavalan and had a sampling of all of the above. Good ambiance, albeit pricey."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"It's amazing! The service from haziq, lucas and amos are awesome, definitely gonna comeback!"
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Great place, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Great drinks."
La Maison du Whisky,2,"Opened a bottle there last month and kept the left over there. Wanted to bring the left over bit home but was encouraged by the staff to keep it there.

Just received a call from LDMW that my bottle expire last week and gave me only 4 days to take or finish the bottle. Would be great if they inform me before it actually expire.

Will just stick to Auld Alliance next time."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Amazing liquor variety. Staff are knowledgeable and helpful
La Maison du Whisky,5,If you are a Whiskey lover this place is just stellar.  Really decent choice plus a decent choice of other spirits and liquors for those  non Whiskey loving companions.  Recommended.
La Maison du Whisky,1,Get your staff to understand you run a business .walked in with 6 pax whiskey connoisseur keen on having a  good night cup after dinner .. 2 people sitting  inside and could not  manage a seating configuration for 6... told sorry no space...worst non service ever
La Maison du Whisky,4,Pricey but great collection. Must try if you are around in Robertson Quay
La Maison du Whisky,1,"Had a nasty experience. One of our friends ordered a glass of whisky which stated $24 in the menu, but was $38 in the bill. There was no explanation before we ordered, and only after we questioned the manager did he say every bottle does not cost the same, even if it is the exact same name and vintage. It all depended on their stock levels or some other reason!

The bartender kept saying it was ""only $14 difference, a small amount"". That was not an issue - how much the difference was. It was a matter of principle. He made us feel like cheapskates even though it was they who were dodgy.

We walked away without getting a refund even though we did ask that they honour the price on the menu. We just wanted to leave the place because it was extremely awkward.

They also made another mistake with another one of our bills.

Bad experience overall. Would not recommend."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"I had bookmarked this place well ahead of my visit to Singapore, and it did not disappoint. We had no booking and despite a busy evening, were accommodated for a whisky tasting. The barman also made my wife a cocktail which was not on the menu since she doesn't drink whisky. I left the choices of the whiskys to the barman and after asking me a few questions, poured 3 different Japanese whiskys which were amazing.

Be aware that the drinks are quite pricey, however my only regret is that we only had time to do one visit. Will definitely be back if we ever go back to Singapore.

Visited September 2015"
La Maison du Whisky,4,Good range of whisky but pricey
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Superb whiskey collection - can be pricey, but worth every penny"
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Solid range of spirits and novel cocktails. Try the aurora borealis, fresh af"
La Maison du Whisky,1,"I change my rating to 1 star because it's all what it worth or even less. I ve been there many time, yet your staff did embarrassed me in front of my friend, embarrassed my friends too. I won't go into details but if you like to be placed in awkward situation,  that s the place to go. It's not a cheapo bar, have your staffs trained properly, have them capable to analyses situations. Like many others before me I  won t go back. There s better wisky bar in SG and I know where ."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Love this place and its ambience.  The air conditioning is right for after you drink their cocktails or whiskey. Very chill place.
La Maison du Whisky,3,Very good selection with wide range of whiskey. My only complaint is the price.
La Maison du Whisky,5,Large collection of spirits. Recommended for spirits lovers
La Maison du Whisky,5,"One of the best place to spurce for whisky, whiskey etc. They also offer tasting if you are serious buyer."
La Maison du Whisky,5,My good and unforgettable  memories place
La Maison du Whisky,5,"If you’ve gone down the whisky rabbit hole and you’re in Singapore then drop whatever it is you’re doing and get yourself here ASAP. The stock is as wide-ranging as I’ve seen anywhere, the staff is knowledgeable and passionate about whisky, and, well, just get yourself here and see for yourself. I wish we had one of these in the States."
La Maison du Whisky,4,Great selection of whiskies and friendly staff!
La Maison du Whisky,5,Amazing retailer and bar! The selection is out of this world!
La Maison du Whisky,5,"The place for whiskey lovers. Small cosy bar, countless whiskey around the whole."
La Maison du Whisky,5,"Was offered this bad boy, the only bottle."
La Maison du Whisky,2,"very expensive for a casual bar, hope they will improve themself or review their price list."
La Maison du Whisky,5,Heavenly.... High from the wonderful selection of whiskies from around the world.
La Maison du Whisky,4,"Great selection. They use to sell fever tree tonic which is why I discovered the place in the first place, but will not be selling it any longer."

La Maison du Whisky,3,very good selection of whiskey
La Maison du Whisky,4,Good selection of whiskeys...
La Maison du Whisky,5,Great place to enjoy a dram

Abdul Gaffoor Mosque,4,Well managed place of worship. Ladies facilities closed at times. Additional prayer space available in basement hall with TV screens showing the Speaker to accommodate the large crowds.
Abdul Gaffoor Mosque,5,"The prayer hall is raised above the ground and surrounded with verandahs at the entrance and sides. It is oriented towards Mecca and thus skewed away from the lot lines and the street.
The verandahs are enclosed by a balustrade with circular and lancet-shaped openings and framed by repetitive cinquefoil arches double-framed with heavy mouldings. The bays are marked out with pilasters with ornate capitals. The wide openings give the interior an airiness that contrasts with the heavy columns in the centre of the prayer hall.
On either side of the main entrance are two graduated cinquefoil arched openings. The larger ones are nearest the entrance, while the smaller ones are further away.
The main entrance to the prayer hall is pedimented with an elaborate sundial in which the 25 rays of the sunburst are done in calligraphy. The sundial is flanked on either side by a series of pilasters and columns in miniature. The pediment above the sundial is shaped like an onion dome. The two square minarets on the left and right are complete with miniature columns and arches.
There are panels with calligraphic inscriptions in several places in the mosque, including over the entrance.
The interior of the cupola at the centre of the prayer hall is supported by four large cluster columns that form semicircular arches. Square and round calligraphic inscriptions decorate the interior of the cupola.
The cluster columns that hold up the cupola have elaborate mouldings and capitals.
From the exterior, the cupola emerges from the roof deck as a hexagonal-shaped tower that is divided into three levels and marked out with Doric pilasters.
On the first level of the tower are eight cinquefoil windows with coloured glass panes that let light through to the interior. These windows are ornamented with recessed mihrab-shaped moulding and cinquefoil arches.
The second level has pilasters and capitals and is topped by a balustrade with bottleneck balusters.
There are minarets at the corners of the hexagon. These minarets are crowned with onion-shaped domes with a crescent moon and a star at the pinnacle. The very centre of the hexagon is crowned with a large onion dome topped with a smaller onion dome. On the pinnacle is a star and crescent moon.
The corners of the front verandah have simpler and less elaborate cupolas.
The four corners of the building are anchored by large Corinthian columns in a cluster with elaborate capitals in a leaf design. The interior and exterior of the mosque have several types of columns and pilasters. They are both structural and ornamental and range from Doric to Corinthian. Columns can be paired with pilasters and pilasters are inset into columns.
The mihrab is plain. There is a narrow rectangular panel with a quotation from the Qur'an above it. Next to the mihrab is the minbar, a three-step timber staircase from which the imam leads prayers.
Above the prayer hall is a flat roof deck surrounded by a parapet wall with bottle-shaped balusters. It is topped with a line of 22 small six-level minarets crowned with onion domes, each with a crescent moon. The miniature minarets rise from the pilasters that frame the cinquefoil arched openings below
There is also a type of single-leafed window that is recessed and framed by an elaborate cinquefoil arch. It is flanked with pilasters and pedimented and has the same star-and-crescent pattern of the larger arched openings.
The ablution area in this mosque was originally a pool. This was later drained and a modern wash area put in. It is located outside at the southwest end of the mosque."

Beautiful place. Huge grounds. Wish could have converted more space for worship. Or rather better use of space. Otherwise Alhamdulillah it is a nice masjid.

It is a Hanafi masjid. So bros and sis take note of the timing particularly for Asr prayers.

The masjid serves delicious porridge during ramadhan. Interestingly they have improved the queuing system and the Queue can be long. Severed after Asr prayers -about 5.15pm (hanafi asr timing)

There are a lot of eateries opposite and along the road. Jus next door only they serve good tea and vadai.

Abdul Gaffoor Mosque,3,"Very old and interesting looking colonial mosque, the volunteer at the visitor centre was very welcoming. I'm a male and, as a sign of respect, he insisted I covered up when entering  the prayer hall so put on a full robe.

This wasn't a problem, but i found it contradictory that lots of people (not worshippers) were strewn around everywhere sleeping and snoring away, not very respectful."

This style has an unabashed match - a mixture of southern Indians, Moghul and European influences. Located in the central part of Singapore, it has been restored in 1998 with the capacity of 3,000, and also offers its usual religious classes as well as the Tamil madrassa class.

মূলত 1852 সালে নির্মিত এই মসজিদটি অনন্য স্থাপত্যের সাথে সিঙ্গাপুরের জাতীয় স্মৃতিস্তম্ভগুলির মধ্যে একটি হিসাবে পার্থক্য অর্জন করেছে। এটি শৈলী একটি unabashed মেলান আছে - দক্ষিণ ভারতীয়, Moghul এবং ইউরোপীয় প্রভাব একটি মিশ্রণ।সিঙ্গাপুরের সেন্ট্রাল অংশে অবস্থিত, এটি 3,000 এর ক্ষমতা সহ পুনরায় 1998 সালে পুনরায় চালু করা হয়েছে এবং তামিলের মাদ্রাসা শ্রেণির পাশাপাশি তার স্বাভাবিক ধর্মীয় ক্লাসগুলিও প্রদান করে।"

Juga banyak restoran dengan masakan Melayu dan Indonesia, sehingga sering menjadi tujuan wisata sekaligus sholat dan mencicipi hidangan Indonesia.
Masjid yang berada di kawasan Kampong Glam ini merupakan salah satu masjid yang terkenal di Singapura. Masjid ini juga telah menjadi salah satu destinasi wisata apabila orang berkunjung ke Singapura karena letaknya yang sangat dekat dengan Pusat Kebudayaan Melayu. Di sekitar sini terdapat banyak restoran yang menyajikan makanan halal, mulai dari makanan khas Melayu hingga makanan khas timur tengah."

Abdul Gaffoor Mosque,5,"(Translated by Google) Historical mosque located around the city center.
The location is not far from the Sultan Mosque. Easy to reach. Close to Jalan Besar and Bugis MRT Stations, as well as the Sim Lim electronic shopping center.

In my opinion, the architectural details are more interesting than that of the Sultan Mosque. Very beautiful.

This mosque is indeed less exposed as one of the tourist destinations in Singapore, perhaps because its function for the surrounding community is quite diverse.
There are madrasa classes opposite the main mosque building, still within the mosque complex.
So maybe it would be better if it wasn't too crowded with tourist visits.

(Original)
Masjid bersejarah yang berada di seputaran pusat kota.
Lokasinya tak jauh dari Masjid Sultan. Gampang dijangkau. Dekat dengan Jalan Besar dan Bugis MRT Stations, juga dengan pusat belanja elektronik Sim Lim.

Menurut saya, detail arsitekturnya lebih menarik ketimbang yang dimiliki oleh Masjid Sultan. Indah sekali.

Masjid ini memang kurang terekspos sebagai salah satu destinasi wisata di Singapura, mungkin karena fungsinya untuk masyarakat sekitar cukup beragam.
Ada kelas-kelas madrasah di seberang bangunan utama masjid, masih dalam kompleks masjid.
Sehingga mungkin akan lebih baik kalau nggak terlalu ramai dengan kunjungan wisatawan."

Abdul Gaffoor Mosque,4,"(Translated by Google) Walking through the Little India area, I was attracted by the fairy-tale shape of this moving Muslim mosque, the bright yellow color of beige and yellow, because I have my favorite stars. Although the building is being held at this time, the building's body is half covered, but I am still discovering the eyes!

It was originally built in 1970 as the Abdul Gaffoor Mosque in the Abdul Gaffoor Mosque. It is a prominent mosque for local Indian Muslims and is now listed as one of the main mosques for national asset protection. Many netizens said that this building is very similar to Aladdin's lamp, but I think it is wrong? It is obviously like the Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam! (I will introduce it later)
In fact, I really want to go in and see, but in addition to the activities in the inside do not dare, it takes courage to go in, and I am afraid that there are taboo tourists who do not understand and accidentally made mistakes, but what can be observed from the outside is Abdul Kaf There are many buildings in the mosque called the worship building (the meaning of the worship tower, the minaret, the light tower, the Minaret, the lighthouse). It is a common architectural feature of the late mosque to remind Muslim believers to worship on time. If you have the opportunity to come to this next time, don't forget to stop and look at the main entrance of the temple. There is a sunburst pattern plus the Arabic sundial, which is a unique treasure in the Islamic world! .

走過小印度區，被身旁這動回教清真寺童話般的造型、米黃黃加綠的鮮艷配色吸引，因為有我最喜歡的星星。雖然此時裡頭正舉辦活動，建築物本體被遮住一半，但厲眼睛的我仍是發現了！

原來它是建於1970年的清真寺Abdul Gaffoor Mosque阿都卡夫回教堂 ，是當地印度回教徒朝拜重要的回教堂，也是現在已被列為國家資產保護主要回教堂之一。很多網友說這間很像阿拉丁神燈的建築，但我覺得是不是搞錯了什麼？明明是甘榜格南的蘇丹清真寺比較像！（晚點也會介紹到）
其實我很想進去看看，不過除了裡頭辦活動不敢之外，進去需要勇氣，也怕有什麼禁忌觀光客不懂而不小心犯了錯，不過從外頭能觀察到的就是阿都卡夫回教堂建築物有很多叫拜樓（喚拜樓、宣禮塔、光塔、Minaret即燈塔的意思），是晚期清真寺常有的建築特色，用以提醒穆斯林信眾按時禮拜。若你下次有機會來到這一探究竟的話，別忘記停下腳步看看廟堂的主要入口處，有一個旭日圖案加上阿拉伯文的日規，是伊斯蘭教界中獨一無二的珍品喔！。"

The service room in the church has a warm English guide.

Little Guilin,5,"Really nice views of the quarry! We spent an hour here taking pictures and having a small picnic. the weather wasn't sunny but we still got some great pictures. There are plenty of places to sit down and relax and enjoy the fresh air and atmosphere.

Midway through, it started raining heavily. There are small rain shelter areas so huddle up in and it was nice to see some thunderstorms in the quarry."
Little Guilin,5,"Nearest mrt station is Bukit Gombak Exit B. Have attached photos of how to walk from mrt station. Turn left after bicycle parking bay. Walked about 5mins, is next to Bukit Gombak Stadium. Actually can view the qurray from buses passed by. It is surrounded by stone pathway."
Little Guilin,4,Small Park that has view resemble a bit like China's famous Guilin.
Little Guilin,5,"Nice oasis of nature in Singapore. Although situated next to a road, there are parts of the walk you can still enjoy the serenity and peacefulness of the place. With the quarry rocks as the backdrop, it is indeed a picturesque place."
Little Guilin,5,Beautiful and serene.  Ery relaxing place surrou ded by water and trees. Such a landscape too while one can enjoy watching the scene as they sit down on those big rock formations. So happy I had been in here.
Little Guilin,5,"Picturesque former quarry that gives a decent little taste of majestic natural views on this little island, and for currently grounded wanderlusters to pretend to be overseas right now... Lovely sheer ""cliffs"" to serve as a scenic backdrop for a casual picnic out (less the hot weather here), slightly marred by the murky water."
Little Guilin,5,"A hidden gem in the suburbs of Singapore. This former quarry is now a beautifully landscaped park with impressive cliffs - however it still has a human scale. Every time I’ve been here it is nice and quiet - it’s so peaceful to sit under the forest canopy by the lake, listening to birdsongs echo back and forth across the vividly coloured rock walls. Truly a special place."
Little Guilin,5,"Nature wonder. From an old rock quarry it has transform into a quaint picturesque landmark. It does looks like a smaller version of Guilin. Look carefully, you might catch a glimpse of tortoise 🐢 in the water."
Little Guilin,5,"Peaceful and serene, people staying opposite this place is so lucky. Though small, Little Guilin gives a scenic view that is complete opposite of the typical concrete jungle that Singapore is know for. The greens and the body of water  added to the feel of the place, makes it easy to mistake this place is not in Singapore itself."
Little Guilin,5,Nice scenery. Very small. About 20 mins to walk around.
Little Guilin,4,Lovely place.  Saw few photographs at there try to find amazing photos. Recommended
Little Guilin,5,"Relaxing place, nice place to have picnic also"
Little Guilin,5,"Went there to play my remote controlled jeep (Crawlers)... Superb place to play with many rocks and roots... Overall, it is a nice place to chill, jog and stroll in the park..."
Little Guilin,4,A nice and small area with a very unqiue looking natural scenery! Even met people taking photos in ancient Chinese outfit during my visit! A great place for a chinese-themed photoshoot 👍🏻
Little Guilin,5,Small place but great view. Very scenic and good for photography. We managed to spot the grey-headed fish eagle when we went there. Accessible by bus and ample parking space in nearby HDB estate across the road from Little Guilin.
Little Guilin,4,"A mini size version of Guilin, Guangxi, China."
Little Guilin,5,Very convenient to get there. 5 mins walk from Bukit Gombak MRT. Nice place to visit. Lots of big tall tress and big stones for you to sit and rest there. Was lucky it was very windy today when I visit today. Lots of birds lover there watching and photo on the Grey Headed.
Little Guilin,5,"Nice view of Hills and Lake. Open sitting Area with view points. Can see Monitor Lizards, Fish, Turtles and Eagles there. I find it pretty relaxing, though not preferred to go during night, as sometime Snakes seen in this Area too.
Lot of Nature Photographers to shoot Eagles diving to eat Fishes and married couples come here for pre-wedding photo shoot."
Little Guilin,5,"Quiet place, not so crowded. Bird lovers can find grey headed fish eagles here. Half a km from bukit gombak MRT"
Little Guilin,4,Scenic route if you are nearby for a run but be warned it's not a paved path and is kinda slippery on rainy days. Not crowded at most times of the day.
Little Guilin,5,A quiet and picturesque place to hang around while walking exercise along Chua chu kang Park connector 😍
Little Guilin,5,"Little place for nature lovers! Found a few turtles there, the hills look wonderful. Definitely a good place to enjoy nature."
Little Guilin,4,"Nice natural scenery.
Relaxing.
Use public transport
As no specific nearby parking lot."
Little Guilin,5,"A picturesque good stop to capture a different scenery of Singapore, much more accessible than Singapore Quarry. A throw away from Bukit Gombak MRT, this park is Instagramable from many angles that excludes Singapore‘s skyline"
Little Guilin,5,An enjoyable park to stroll and admire the beautiful disused granite quarry. With a resemblance to the granite rock formations in Guilin.
Little Guilin,5,nice serene little place to take a chill walk at
Little Guilin,5,Little get away in a hdb jungle in Singapore.
Little Guilin,5,"Little Guilin is an abandoned granite quarry. It is just a short walk from behind Bukit Gombak MRT. A short stretch of park along the front of the lake for visitors to enjoy the scenery.

Have also encountered many different bird species, so maybe this can be an alternative place for bird watching too?"
Little Guilin,5,Must visit place in Bukit batik and hill view surrounding..
Little Guilin,4,"When I lived around toh tuck road, I used to come a few times per month. 25 years after, nothing has changed. The Shell station is still there, the cobblestones pathways are still there, I did not climb the stairs up to the war memorial but I guess it's still there. It's reassuring, the place is very popular with a lot of residents living nearby exercising during the day, and in the evening. It's not huge, but it's well maintained, it's clean, and the little Guilin is indeed minuscule compared to her bigger sisters in China. Great place and full of memories."
Little Guilin,5,I had no idea there's a place like this in SG! If you like hiking and nature this place is perfect for you 🌻
Little Guilin,5,Very nice and beautiful. An unexpected patch of nature
Little Guilin,5,"Nice place to take a rest on your cycle ride, take in the scenery of the rock face which is not easy to find in Singapore’s hustle and bustle city. Amazing views and worth a visit - park is not big so take some time out to enjoy the scenery that you see."
Little Guilin,5,"Near MRT, Free and nice natural place"
Little Guilin,5,"Quaint and picturesque, so surprised that the whole scene reminds me of the time I was in Guilin! It's just amazing what we can find in Singapore when we explore enough! Lovely place to walk see and relax"
Little Guilin,5,Nice place to stroll.. Amazing view.. Love tha place..
Little Guilin,4,Good place for picnic. This place is not that big. Would not call it a hike. 20min Max u can finish visiting th place😅
Little Guilin,5,A favourite scenic spot for taking photos. Many couples had some of their wedding shots taken there too. #FavouriteSingaporePlaces
Little Guilin,4,"The place is nice and a few minutes walk from MRT. Although it’s is convenient to access, the area is only a short distance walk. I would recommend to take a rest, not suitable for a day trip."
Little Guilin,5,"Beautiful place in the middle of stone cold HDBs. Looks like it’s it’s a hot place, but the shade cools everyone down from the hot weather."
Little Guilin,5,It's easy to get there via public transport. Make you feel like you are in a different country. Good to bring kids along to unleash their energy....
Little Guilin,4,Those short cuts are no longer there but the environment are still beautiful...
Little Guilin,4,Nice little jem just behind the MRT station.
Little Guilin,5,"Conveniently located just a stone’s throw away from Bukit Gombak MRT, this tranquil place provides some refuge from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city living. Come here to self-reflect, get clarity, and just chill."
Little Guilin,4,Nice view and peaceful. But alot of mosquitoes
Little Guilin,5,"Small park, serene. The huge rock boulder as mystique as ever."
Little Guilin,4,It’s one of nice places in Singapore
Little Guilin,5,"Cozy place for a walk and snap photo.

Little Guilin,3,Nice scenery but very crowded on weekends.
Little Guilin,5,"Not a very big place, but if you are looking for a place to sit down have a chat with nature in the surroundings, than it's perfect and just nice to spend time at!"
Little Guilin,5,"Surreal feels within a serene sanctuary, far removed from the usual bustling vibe Singapore is known for. Plenty of quiet spots to sit and relax"
Little Guilin,5,Pretty spot to chill out in nature. Easily accessible.
Little Guilin,4,Beautiful but small. Good for a fun trip. Go on a weekday so that you can enjoy the quiet and peacefulness.
Little Guilin,5,"Beautiful place, very peaceful and quiet."
Little Guilin,5,First time I go there 😘😘
Little Guilin,4,"One of the early scenic place where people comes here for wedding photos. Name after China Gui-Lin for it beautiful attraction. The forgotten landmark less traveled. Sunrise is a better time for nice ""Zen"" Shot."
Little Guilin,5,"I must say I did not expect much when I first saw the name, even though I haven't been to Guilin. I happened to be around that area and decided to take a short bus ride to check out this park named after a place in China. And holy cupcakes, the view, which I could see  miles away, and the beauty really blew me away! It's much better in real life than in photos, there are lots of big rocks, dome-shaped huts with stone table, and wooden benches all around for you to rest and take in all this beauty. It is conveniently located near Bukit Gombak MRT, I would definitely head over again if I am hear the area."
Little Guilin,4,"Nice and quaint little place to chill at. Was windy when i visited, not many people also. There are some rocks and seats around to sit on, to take in the surroundings"
Little Guilin,3,"Very scenic and pretty, tranquil view of the quarry. Even saw an Eagle there. Prepare to bring mosquito spray though"
Little Guilin,4,"Amazing walking and running track. Can have a great view, sit around, click nice pics and can spend good time.

Just a walking distance from Bukit Gombak MRT."
Little Guilin,5,Tranquil n out of the blue giant Rock from old Quarry during the sixty n maybe earlier..Bt Gombak MRT is just around the junction
Little Guilin,5,"A hidden little gem in Singapore, takes one right into the memories of Guilin"
Little Guilin,4,"Interesting rock faces, ok for a quick visit, close to the road"
Little Guilin,4,Great place to unwind. Sight monitor lizards in the lake sometimes too!
Little Guilin,3,Pretty green spot and was completely taken away with the rock face coming out of the water.
Little Guilin,2,"Was impressed with the enormous rock, but didn't like the stagnant and unappealing water."
Little Guilin,5,Nice little park with many fishing enthusiastically. Saw foot long tilapia caught twice within minutes! Teeming with birds too. Many arm with giant lenses to photograph a young owl!
Little Guilin,5,"Great place to relax and reflect. Can get busy occasionally on weekends but fairly peaceful. Definitely brings back memories of when I was in Guilin.

The Park isn't that big, max 20-30 mins and you'll finish walking around the entire area"
Little Guilin,1,"Not wheel chair friendly as the path round the lake is made of uneven rocks. It was a very bumpy  ride for my mom. She did not enjoy the day out to Little Guilin at all , inspite of the beauty and serenity of the place."
Little Guilin,5,A quiet corner within a busy neighbourhood
Little Guilin,4,"It was my first visit to little Guilin on a Saturday afternoon & I felt like a tourist in my own country hahahaha. Tucked away in Bukit Batok Town Park is this former stone quarry. Although the park itself was not as huge as I thought it would be, still I was amazed by the unique beauty & serenity of the surroundings, the water & interesting rock cliffs. Although the water was more brownish green yet was rather clean. Met two boys who were fishing & they told me they caught fishes before. The park in general seemed well maintained & tranquil. I learnt that it opens 24hours. If you wish to explore nature parks in Singapore maybe you should come by for a stroll, fishing or a picnic."
Little Guilin,5,Wonderful place to spend your evening with your family.
Little Guilin,5,"Green, peaceful and accessible park. Many people would come here for picnic / run during the weekend."
Little Guilin,3,The scenery is beautiful but the water is dirty and litters can be found in the water. The water in the pond can be better if the mud at the bottom of the pond can be cleared.
Little Guilin,5,Very nice and romantic places..
Little Guilin,4,awesome place for a short walk with a view of nature and with luck some awesome birds...
Little Guilin,4,Nice scenic nature walk with the kids. Best to come early if with kids!
Little Guilin,4,"Very beautiful place at all times of the day.its not a big area,but it's serene with a great view of nature tucked away from the bustling residential area"
Little Guilin,5,A beautiful place albeit you won't spend a lot of time covering this place on the footpath. A great example of how Singapore preserves nature areas yet has built public housing and infrastructure around said areas
Little Guilin,4,Haven't been here for long times. Remind me of the old good NS days where I often came to the nearby coffee shops for meals with my colleagues.
Little Guilin,4,Small park with scenic views. Can walk the connector to bukit batok reserve
Little Guilin,3,Not a big park but the interesting n scenic backdrop still appealing n attracts lots of people to track n exercise there ..  Only concern for us was seeing small crowds in bigger than 2 gathering n picnic such as the foreign workers so hope to see some safety ambassador petrolling around
Little Guilin,3,Peaceful place for weekend getaways.
Little Guilin,5,Its a peaceful place.
Little Guilin,5,Beautiful place for a time to relax all times a day. There is benches here and there so that you can anjoy the sight from different perspectives. Even bring a picnic and enjoy family time just in front of the lake.
Little Guilin,4,"A serene and beautiful place to walk. The natural rocky landscape tells about about the history of the place. A must visit place when in the area of Bukit Gombak, Singapore."
Little Guilin,5,C c look LOOk.
Little Guilin,5,Short walk from mrt. Lots of ppl picnicing there in the weekends. Beautiful place.
Little Guilin,5,The scenery at Little Guilin is very beautiful during dawn.
Little Guilin,5,"Little place but relaxed scenery. A complete natural feeling in a city area. Good place for residence of Bukit Batok. Definitely worth a visit, feels like you're not in city."
Little Guilin,5,Very beautiful place in Bukit batok quite small can finish in 30 mins
Little Guilin,5,Lovely in the morning
Little Guilin,4,I just like how xiao guilin looks. Would be better if it is taken at sun rise or sun set. Will be back again for sure!
Little Guilin,4,Still suitable for a walk on the evening for nature's view .
Little Guilin,5,Loved the atmosphere surrounded the area..peaceful..all about nature..
Little Guilin,5,Amazing. Beautiful place
Little Guilin,4,Nice place to stroll in the evening but remember to apply insect repellant
Little Guilin,4,"Nice place to go for walk around, jogging or just seating for relaxing"
Little Guilin,4,"Tranquil and picturesque as the rare boulder cliffs left behind from a granite quarry of the past. This has been skillfully preserved and made into a viewing spot with nice tall forest trees, stone paths and park, aptly named after a famous place in China, Guiling."
Little Guilin,5,"Lovely view, I once saw a shooting star when I visited at night. Amazing!"
Little Guilin,4,Nice place for a walk. Lots of birds around. Good for bird watchers.
Little Guilin,5,Select your viewpoint to get the nature scene without buildings.  Still possible. 😉

Little Guilin,5,Great views to Meditate.
Little Guilin,5,Great place for picnic...
Little Guilin,5,"Fantastic history behind this old disused quarry that is now being managed by local authorities.
Right now it's basically an aesthetically pleasing backdrop of a really small park since you can't walk closer around it.
Find some local creatures and critters living in and abouts it and explore this pleasingly serene place."
Little Guilin,5,Beautiful Place that you should not miss for a relaxing evening walk
Little Guilin,5,"Very less people here.. The view 😍😍😍
#whycanhavesuchplaceinamiddleofcityhuh"

Little Guilin,5,"It is a nice place, small but you can sit on one stone the whole afternoon."
Little Guilin,5,Little Guilin is one of the best serene place. It's not crowded. Best place to take outdoor photos.
Little Guilin,3,"A small peaceful park that is a short walking distance from MRT. Nice rock formation, but not much else to see. We spent 45 mins at the place and then went back to Jurong East for tea. The only bad thing about the place is the rubblish people left behind."
Little Guilin,2,Nothing to watch. Old quarry with damp water
Little Guilin,3,"It has seen better days..We saw littering in the waters, cigarettes butts on the park grounds, empty beer cans on the stone railings..hey, if these folks dun treasure it, please move out la."
Little Guilin,4,"It's just a walk away from my house and has been part of my walking route for many years! you could just sit around and enjoy the sceneries on cool days. Do go along with children or as couples or friends, i find it appropriate for any group types. The Gombak MRT and stadium are close by."
Little Guilin,5,"A very cute small park! But I mean come on, very different from Guilin hahaha"
Little Guilin,4,"Beautiful scenery, path are not big. Sometimes theres a lot of bicycle"
Little Guilin,5,"Nice and quiet. Good place to see water monitor and many birds, including eagles"
Little Guilin,5,Nice place💕
Little Guilin,4,"One of the more ""scenic"" parks in Singapore. It's little for a reason, small like all of Singapore. Good for a short scenic walk in the concrete jungle all around...."
Little Guilin,5,"This park is quite amazing and silent. You can see the big rock formation at the bottom of the still lake. When i visit this place its not much windy. I'm expecting it to be more cool. But, expectations did not meet my reality. Nevertheless, the scenery here is impressive. Most of all I witnessed a bird I'm not quite sure if its an eagle or a falcon. I saw that it is eating its prey. Lucky me that day..
Honest review the place where breathtaking but I'm disappointed about the color of the water its green.. maybe we can clean this up and turn into a much clearer or blue bodies of water.
But overall my ratings for this Little Guilin is still 5 stars.
Lastly, we need to help each other to keep it clean.. because some places have an awful smell of urine. Maybe the agency that caring for nature put some cctv's or guards to promote good quality and cleanliness of the place. Thank you..."
Little Guilin,4,Quiet and a nice place to jog. Cycled past it while heading towards ulu pandan pcn.
Little Guilin,5,"Felt like a Chinese poet, would bring flute if I could afford one"
Little Guilin,5,"A picturesque view within the city. The garden is well designed and maintained. However, this is a small park, so you'll probably finish the visit within 30 minutes."
Little Guilin,4,Nice and peaceful on a weekday afternoon. Could be better if there's kayaking facilities.
Little Guilin,4,"The pathways are paved with stones; very slippery when wet, please wear footwear that provides good grip"

Little Guilin,5,A rare sight
Little Guilin,3,"Little Guilin is 6 mins walk distance from nearby Bukit Gombak MRT (NS3). There has no public parking lots in this park. So, you have to park your vehicle at opposite HDB. I would recommend going there in the morning or evening."
Little Guilin,5,"Tranquil, green & peaceful place to hang out and breathe in the nature. Called little Guilin because it resembles 桂林 in China (duh fact ikr but just putting it out here lol). It's not a very big park but it does have nice shaded areas to picnic in and walk around. The repulsive part about our visit is the mosquitos. But well, that's an essential part of the experience I guess. Great place for photo-taking too! Will wanna spend a longer time here next time."
Little Guilin,5,Enjoy the breeze and like the quiet relaxing place. Good to come after jogging at stadium beside.
Little Guilin,5,Nice view point but not that big place
Little Guilin,5,This is the landscape I wake up with every morning and where I have my lunch along with birds and ants. Listening to the sounds of the nature is healing. A peaceful place for thinking and being witness how Allah created the universe and the life.
Little Guilin,4,"Relatively quiet and well maintained. Nice view of little guilin from different viewing spots. For aerial view, ascend to the top of the cliff (6-8 storeys high) , best view in my opinion.

Another tip is to start here before the Bukit Batok nature trail since this will only require a 20mins stay to fully appreciate it as it is very small and the sole purpose of the park is for viewing the little guilin."
Little Guilin,5,Childhood memories 🥰🥰
Little Guilin,3,"good view but nothing much to do here.
water is bad, hope the livings are fine in there. saw a tortoise.

Little Guilin,4,"Its about 5 to 10 minutes walk from Bt. Gombak Mrt Station. From the pictures i looked, i had an impression its at a very secluded area which will be far deep inside. To my surprise its actual quite accessible similar to an estate park.

Nearby Bt Gombak MRT ."

The name ‘Little Guilin‘ is apt and makes perfect sense!! Just loved this place!!"

However, This Place Has Lots Of Mosquitos Due To The Lake That Allows The Mosquitos To Lay It's Eggs, (They Often Attacks At Night 🌌) Also, If It Rains, You Have To Walk Quite A While To Find Shelter If Your On The Farthest Area From Hdbs, Stadium Next Door Or The MRT Station (Bukit Gombak NS3).

That said, maintenance and build of most facilities are not very well done, and residents feel a little ""old"" and cold every time I go over."

Little Guilin,4,"Bukit Batok Town Park also known as Little Guilin is a beautiful  nature park located in the precinct of Guilin in the town of Bukit Batok, Singapore. The park was  formed from a discontinued granite quarry. It has  some resemblance to the granite rock formations in Guilin, China. Hence it is also known as Little Guilin. Rain water stagnated in this  rock cavities is looking very beautiful and fishes turtles and lizards are seen in the lake. People walk, use bicycles  on the well maintained roads adjacent to the lake. This place is easily accessible using public transport.  One need to carry water and sun screen Lotion for protection"

What left now is just a sad scene with polluted water. 😥"
Little Guilin,5,"Nice place to relax and enjoy the scenery. This is not something you usually get in Singapore, less said at such a convenient location (near the MRT)."
Little Guilin,4,"Otherwise known as our 小桂林 ""little guilin"" the cliffs is a rare scene in Singapore, but nothing as good as the real Guilin. Moreover, marks of city development footprints is destroying the natural beauty. However, great place for exercise, greenery and trail."
Little Guilin,4,Couldn't find any way to reach to the top of the cliff. But view from down was good.

Little Guilin,5,"Little Guilin (Chinese: 小桂林) is a park in Bukit Gombak, Singapore. It is a popular visitor attraction due to its similarity to the scenery of Guilin, China.
This is a nice place to relax and enjoy the nature."
Little Guilin,5,Serene
Little Guilin,5,Beautiful scenery
Little Guilin,5,"Nice, calm, relaxing place. Don't expect any playground."
Little Guilin,3,The legendary architectural work. Little Guilin was once a famous attraction. But now a bit deserted and the pond is really dirty already.
Little Guilin,5,"Tranquil lake! Rock cliff surround the lake, home to indgenious birds. Butterflies were dancing gracefully. Admire the turtles and fishes swimming happily in the pond. Offers flora and fauna as you walk through, surrounded by towering trees and beautiful flowers. We had a whale of time. Within walking distance to bt batok and bt gombak. Worth a visit."
Little Guilin,4,Nice place
Little Guilin,5,Small but quiet park with nice scenery.
Little Guilin,5,Very scenic spot. A good stop for a photoshot while jogging or cycling. Close to Bt. Gombak MRT
Little Guilin,3,Small but nice quarry  in  the  midst  of  high  rise  residential homes. We were unable to find any footpath or track round it.
Little Guilin,4,You can escape from town life to nature life.
Little Guilin,5,"Definitely worth a visit, feels like you're not in Singapore"
Little Guilin,3,You are just looking at a rocky hill with a pond below it
Little Guilin,5,"A very peaceful place to go to if you are looking for somewhere to calm your mind after a long,stressful day.Very easy to get there from Bukit Gombak MRT station and there are vending machines to get drinks from at a nearby stadium."

Little Guilin,3,Decent but nth much..
Little Guilin,2,"An old quarry that you can walk next to. It's ""upgraded"" in such a way that you'd be disengaged from nature and have zero connection with it. What a pity."
Little Guilin,5,A lovely and quiet place to relax with amazing scenery.

Little Guilin,5,Stunning views in the evening sunset
Little Guilin,1,Okay
Little Guilin,5,Very relex place
Little Guilin,5,Unexpected find in a highly developed country.
Little Guilin,5,"With the title of 'Bukit Batok Town Park' it's easy to miss this scenic gem in Singapore. From the name it sounds like somewhere a family would take the kids to play on the swings, whereas I think it would be much more appreciated by those looking for a bit of nature in SG. This is my favourite of the various quarries in the Bukit Batok/Bukit Timah area. On a day with blue skies and a bit of a breeze it is a very pleasant spot to while away an hour or so. There's not a lot to do but you can enjoy the peace and quiet, take a few photos of Xiao Guilin, spot turtles/terrapins and a few other creatures in the water and dragonflies and butterflies around the park - altogether a top spot if you are the outdoorsy type or fancy a brief escape from the bustle of Singapore's busier areas."
Little Guilin,5,Few remaining spots in Singapore whereby you can temporarily feel Nature.
Little Guilin,3,Another of Singapore's more unique sight which was said to resemble China's Guilin.  Nothing much to do there sadly.

Near Bukit Gombak MRT,
After leaving the station from Bukit Gombak MRT, you will arrive after passing the stadium

-""Coughing hills?""

Bukit Batok Town Park was originally a granite quarry.
In Malay, Bukit=mountain; Batok=cough,
There is a saying:
People compare the sound of quarrying to coughing,
In the end it was named Bukit Batok.

-""From quarry to park""

However, because mining stones may harm the local ecology,
Then the Singapore government decided to close the quarry,
After being abandoned and converted into a park.
To
The park is not big, but the ecology is rich,
The big lizard is basking on the shore,
Deep rooted Tembusu
Walking is also capturing the ecology,
It can be completed in about half an hour,
And keep going,
Will arrive at another nature park-Bukit Batok Nature Park

(Original)
- Bukit Batok Town Park又名: 小桂林(Little Guilin)

- 位置:

在Bukit Gombak MRT 附近，
從Bukit Gombak MRT出站後，經過stadium後就會到了

- ""咳嗽的山丘?""

Bukit Batok Town Park原本為花崗岩採石場，
而在馬來文內，Bukit=山；Batok =咳嗽，
其中有種說法是：
人們把採石的聲音比擬為咳嗽聲，
最後得名為Bukit Batok。

- ""從採石場到公園""

然而因採礦石可能會危害到當地生態，
隨後新加坡政府決定關閉此採石場，
廢棄後並被改建為公園。

公園不大，但生態豐富，
大蜥蜴在岸邊曬太陽，
深紮根的Tembusu(登布樹/香灰莉木)，
散步同時也在捕捉生態，
約莫半小時內可以繞完，
而再繼續往前走，
會到達另一個自然公園- Bukit Batok Nature Park"

SKAI Bar,5,Was there for the lunch set. Views and food were great. Service was prompt and efficient. Would definitely recommend
SKAI Bar,5,"Decor and ambience scores a 11/10, yes an 11, note the Arco, Castellini and the chairs, tables, a designer’s haven. Food scores a 9/10, presentation and taste is on-point but as always, subjective to individuals. Service scores an 7/10 because they were too under-staff to the extend making request needs to be repeated twice. Overall still deserves a 5 star because perfection in this trying period is very scarce. Will I come back again? Definitely but I hope the service aspect is taken care of to match up to the level and aura this establishment is exuding."
SKAI Bar,5,"A wonderful evening at Skai Restaurant. Definitely a breathtaking view at the window seat! The staff were top-notch in their service and one of the staff there is highly skilled in photography.

Loved the nice gesture on the cake and write up. Would highly recommend but do book early, especially if you are eyeing on the converted window seats, takes months in advance on book then and you have to write in!"
SKAI Bar,4,"The food is just ok. Basically, you pay for the view instead of the food. The mushroom butter is good.
Food = 3/5
Ambience = 4/5
Service = 5/5"
SKAI Bar,5,"Tasty and balanced flavour food. I personally enjoyed the food. It’s taste combination isn’t too strong so the ingredients and recipes are very well thought, met expectation of a place of such caliber.

View is exceptional good but it was rainy the day we went. Seems like we will have to pay another visit. Highly recommended!"
SKAI Bar,4,"Skai Bar is recommended for after dinner drinks. It is quiet and has a nice view. The service is friendly and attentive. It would be much better with music, but the current restrictions do not permit it."
SKAI Bar,5,One of my favourite spots for date night with a view. Oysters are a must. Their mains and cocktails are really good too. Love their service 👍🏻 Remember to ask for a window seat (if you prefer) when you make your reservation :)
SKAI Bar,3,"we were not at window seat, no chance to enjoy nice view. Should not take advise from waiter to serve all starters. Too much and could not eat them all. No chance to try other dishes."
SKAI Bar,5,"Fantastic. Great view, good service.a but pricy, but expected. Pretty spacious too. Reservations are recommended  especially if you want a table beside the window"
SKAI Bar,5,"Great high tea experience from 70th floor.
Excellent view from this height with cosy atmosphere and delicious food."
SKAI Bar,5,"Dining on the 70th floor overlooking the city doesn’t come often so it’s worth the occasion and the price to dine at this restaurant. Service is great and food is high quality and well prepared. Many dishes to choose from ranging from starters, small plates, steaks, mains, desserts and a very extensive drinks list."
SKAI Bar,3,"SKAI is not worth its price point, with the same money you could eat much more interesting and delicious food at numerous other mid-tier restaurants.

I benefitted from my friend’s 50% discount, and I still don’t think it was worth it.

The starters were delicious and the Cod was a standout main, but it really all went downhill from there. Overall, the meal was plain and lacked the wow factor I’ve experienced at similar restaurants.

Our STARTERS
- Stuffed Shiitake: Yummy! It was like eating a nicely flavoured savoury pie, but with better texture (I do love my mushrooms)

- Smoked Burrata: Also yummy, balanced with smashed avo, passion fruit and a perfect balsamic vinaigrette

- Salmon and Scallop Tartar: Familiar flavours, but well executed.

MAINS
- Black Cod: Perfectly cooked and flavoured, loved the little zingy, tart surprises in the sauce

- Grilled Lobster & Crab Squid-ink Spaghetti: Lobster was overcooked and rubbery, which really ruined the dish. Outside the star ingredient, the dish was flavoured well enough with the presence of capers. But as they say, nothing to write home about

- Westholme Flat Iron: the most boring steak I have ever had at this kind of restaurant, despite the meat quality and it being cooked to a textbook medium rare.

DESSERTS (the most gimmicky and disappointing part of the meal)
- Chocolate Sphere: It was like eating a giant jaffar lolly, which I personally don’t like. The worst part was how pedestrian the execution was, it felt like they didn’t try to elevate the flavours at all. So there was nothing to appreciate here.

- Strawberry trifle: same as above, the lemongrass jelly was a nice touch and I interspersed spoonful with sips of my cocktail, which helped. I just wish the dessert had these kicks/extra layers on its own.

The ambience, view, service were good but ultimately it comes down to the food and I really couldn’t recommend SKAI even if you got 50% off."
SKAI Bar,4,Delicious crab cake! Definitely coming again for that
SKAI Bar,5,"Awesome view of the Marina Bay skyline. Food is truly up to the standard for this price point. Got to enjoy the Valentines Day 5 course meal, and every course are paired by complementing sauces that really lingers around the mouth."
SKAI Bar,5,"Good service, Delicious Food (ordered the steak and lobster pasta) and fantastic views.

Bare in mind that during covid, you have to walk out of raffles city to enter from the hotel's lobby entrance which may be inconvenient on a rainy day"
SKAI Bar,5,Picture Perfect view at the bar area despite not having the usual tables. Fine dining at its finest !
SKAI Bar,5,Lovely place for a hens high tea or birthday. I suggest the standard high tea vs the premium cos the top up isn’t really worth it. All else is excellent!
SKAI Bar,5,"Loved the ambience and the service! Although they have a nice lunch set, we decided to order a la carte as their main menu had a more selections."
SKAI Bar,5,The staff are super friendly and make you feel warmly welcomed. Service is great and the food is exceptional. Highly recommend!
SKAI Bar,5,"Visited alone for some birthday me-time. Food was great for both the lunch set and afternoon tea, and I was thrilled by the fantastic view from my seat at the bar counter. Service was impeccable. Even though they were clearly rather busy, perhaps due to being a little understaffed, several friendly staff members still took the initiative to check on me periodically without being intrusive. The bartender on duty even took a moment to check if my tea had steeped properly, and did so quietly because I was reading. Thanks!"
SKAI Bar,2,"Service was excellent, the staff were attentive and not too intrusive. Presentation of the food was nice. However, the food was lacklustre. Stale bread were used, everything was 'soft and brittle' just like how you leave baked puff pastries and bread out in the open for too long. Went for the $65 high tea set but honestly, there are better places to go to at a better price point. Will I visit again, probably yes but only for the view and a drink, no food."
SKAI Bar,1,Service is bad... can u believe putting all your cutlery on the table is perfectly fine for them as they claim table is very clean. Even I go any other 5 star restaurant all cutlery is properly place on a napkin or others not on the table... ordered was wrong ... conclusion if you are not ge rich class dun go as they dun really want to serve you... I am just a average spender ... not the rich class ...
SKAI Bar,4,"Up in the sky, but not quite heavenly. I want to like, neigh, love (!) SKAI, but there’s always something holding me back from giving it an elusive fifth star. Today, we spent $220 on lunch for two adults and one toddler. While the menu has been daring and experimental - with some hits and misses- I’m thankful that they nailed the most of our order. The striploin was cooked, and seasoned well, but the quality of cut was nothing special - it’s saving grace being the red wine sauce. The desserts and appetisers were delicious but sadly my toddler rated the $35 kid’s fish and chips a dastardly “DNF” (he Did Not Finish half of it). But what disappoints me the most is the service. While there is a professional and seemingly friendly veneer, it lacks warmth and can even feel condescending and pretentious at times. I couldn’t even take photos of my family with a flash, resulting in either blown out backgrounds or incredibly dark foregrounds. Diners who face this photographic conundrum might as well be dining on this first floor."
SKAI Bar,4,"Ambience is perfect. Ordered the set dinner, foie gras is a bit of disappointment, it did not melt in my mouth 😅. Ordered the steak as main, that was nicely cooked and the meat is very tender. Need to mention the dessert, it's the peace with yogurt, it's really very nice dessert. Price of course is on the high side, but I would say the view is just awesome."
SKAI Bar,4,"The service there is top notched.

The ambience,  which I would suspect is what a lot of people are drawn to this place,  is very dependent on seating. Although we made reservations 2 days on advance,  we did not manage to get a window seat. Which slightly defeated one of the place's highlight.

The place was full on a weekday lunch. But service staff were still very alert and attentive. Water was topped up promptly.

We had the set lunch.  Which was either a 2/3/4 or 5 course meal. Ranges in price between 58 to 158 per pax. Additional charges for caviar and 8 dollars for each side ordered.

The lunch I felt was very nicely plated,  and tasted good. But not fantastic. Portion was decent.

I'm pretty sure the night time scene would be a lot nicer."
SKAI Bar,5,"Nice view of the city, food is good.  I personally like the salmon, the salmon dish is very appetising.  Very friendly service."
SKAI Bar,4,"The National Day Dinner was a great experience overall. The views were of course amazing, and we had some great experiences watching the fighter jets fly over twice, the helicopters carrying the flag, and of course the final fireworks display. The staff were friendly and welcoming, though they were quite busy which led to some delays in clearing our plates and delivering our next courses and drinks. But everyone was warm and thoughtful in their service, and happy to accommodate our special requests, such as when my husband asked for a substitute sauce for his steak course, rather than the truffle sauce on the menu.

The food was good, highlights were the William Pear dessert which was amazing. It tasted fantastic, especially the delicate and creamy mousse instead the white chocolate 'pear', and the presentation was equally impressive. And of course their awesome sourdough bread with mushroom butter (appreciated the offer to refill the bread too). I loved the interesting combination of flavours in the foie gras starter, the lobster risotto was enjoyable and well cooked, but my husband found his steak a bit tough and just generally underwhelming. It was fine, but nothing special.

And one major negative for me...I find it strange that they won't serve tap water to guests though; I always order this, not to save on cost but because I am conscious of the environmental impact and want to save on the needless waste generated by bottled water, and I feel in a country where tap water is potable this should always be the default option for guests, particularly at such a high price point.

The rest of the drinks were great, my husband enjoyed one of their signature cocktails and the very talented bartender happily made him a standard old fashioned when he requested this. They also arranged a small chocolate cake with a happy birthday message for my husband, which we certainly appreciated!

Overall a good spot to celebrate a special occasion."
SKAI Bar,5,"Great High Tea and dining experience on the 70th floor of The Swissotel Stamford!

Great view of the Marina Bay area!

Not to be missed!

Highly recommended!"
SKAI Bar,4,Good food. Great space. Beautiful view. Would return.
SKAI Bar,5,"One of the best High Tea experiences in Asia, with a combination of a good selection of bite sized treats, good friendly service and a great ambience with an amazing view over the central business district all the way to some Indonesian islands on a clear day.  A bit pricey, but what do you expect."
SKAI Bar,3,"Nice ambience.
Food wise is average but dessert is great.
Service not very attentive.  Didn't give suggestions."
SKAI Bar,5,"Used to be Equinox... but varieties and dishes much fanciful then before.. went on a Anniversary Lunch set 4 course menu pairing with wine flight ... for the atmospheric view on special occasion,  is worth it."
SKAI Bar,4,"View was great, got a 6:30pm reservation and managed to catch a beautiful sunset. The starter sourdough was average, saved by the mushroom butter. The smoked hamachi starter was delightful, thick cuts with freshly shaved truffle. Could give the lamb rump a miss, flavour profile was lacking and the cut was pretty tough. Partner ordered the chicken which was also very average. Cheesecake tart was 10/10 (rated by my partner) and we would order again! Would have expected all around better food for the price point but you’re paying for the view (which is honestly amazing)."
SKAI Bar,5,"Had an enjoyable 3 course lunch experience with Skai! Warm service from the team and the food are just nice in portion. Love the bread as well! Crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside! Wonderful first experience!

Love the beautiful sceneries too!! Thanks Jaimie for arranging a window seat for us!"
SKAI Bar,5,Really fanciful place with a fabulous view of the city. Nice menu with a good range of starters and mains. Good selection of steaks with different cuts.  The Porterhouse cut for 2 to share is nicely done and enjoyable. Staff service is pretty efficient. But the attraction is really the view. Prices are on the high end but worth it for a special occasion.
SKAI Bar,4,"Beautiful views of Marina bay & city. Feels very cosy & relaxed. Food, wine & service were perfect. The food was excellent quality & deliciously presented. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. Thank you Skai."
SKAI Bar,5,"This place has a great view of the Marina bay and surrounding area. We went for the 3 course lunch, which comes with appetizer, mains and dessert. We ordered the miso glazed pumpkin and grilled fish for mains and they both had good interesting flavours. Dessert served was white chocolate mousse and matcha tart. The staff were also accommodating to arrange for a special birthday message with a small piece of chocolate cake for the occasion. Overall we enjoyed the dining experience."
SKAI Bar,4,"Great view, great service but pretty pricy"
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing place. Superb service, made a reservation 2 weeks ago and they remember every detail of my requests. Feel very welcomed although they were very busy, service is still top-notch, staff were very attentive, food served fast too. Great view of SG from the 70th storey. Delicious food. Price is also not too steep for lunch set."
SKAI Bar,4,Best restaurant to enjoy paranomic view of downtown Singapore. Delicious modern western cuisine and friend service.
SKAI Bar,5,"Service was great
View was great
Food was good, only disappointment was the steak which rested for too long (it became well done) :(. Had the premium signature 5 course. The foie gras was amazing.  If you are dining in, please choose the quail over the crab cake! Tasted both, the quail was many times better than the crab cake. Also thumbs up for truffle butter."
SKAI Bar,4,Excellent view and comfort environment. Staffs are nice. But the food is quite standard.
SKAI Bar,5,"Breathtaking view, exquisite food and excellent service."
SKAI Bar,5,"If it's an occasion worth celebrating, then I would suggest this place to anyone and everyone. High ceiling give a grand feel, 66th floor location provides amazing views and the decor is real worthy !
As for the food, it really lives up to the expectation. We took the Lunch set menu and it the 3 courses were all in all a treat to the taste buds. The portion size are good, the flavours are bursting and the desserts especially are top notch. A Must Try !"
SKAI Bar,4,"Breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline welcome you as you arrive on the 70th floor. Was wandering around as there wasn't anyone at reception. Food was quite average, a few hits and misses, in my opinion. Not being able to decide, we went with the lunch set. The cured salmon and duck leg salad were tasty starters. For mains, the roasted chicken thigh could do with a tad more seasoning although the meat was juicy and skin was crispy! Sadly I didn't taste much of the truffle Dashi. Had better seared tuna before but I enjoyed the texture of the hummus that accompanied the dish. Order the hand-cut fries, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; if cooked just a little longer for that added crunch, it would have been perfection!!! The chocolate brulee was interesting; enjoyed how there were so many different textures in one not too sweet dessert. The spiced apple wasn't bad either. Washing down our lunch with some white wine made it all better. Didn't manage to get our server's name but he was friendly and attentive! Just a heads ups, the sets don't come with any tea or coffee, so these will come at additional costs. And we did have to wait quite a long time to get the bill! Overall a pleasant experience, and I reckon it would be good to go in the evenings and watch the sunset! Fantastic for romantic date nights or even a business lunch."
SKAI Bar,3,"Good view, average food and service. We reserved a table for 6PM and when we reach, there was a really pretty sunset to enjoy.

For the food, it was just lots of truffle in almost every dish. Serving size was quite big and price was what you would usually expect for a hotel restaurant. Service was unbelievable. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff and I suspect the place is severely understaffed. We began our dinner at 6:30 but we didn’t even get our mains at 8:30. 😅😅😅"
SKAI Bar,5,"Nice ambiance for get together.
Food is good.
Service staff are attentive, helpful and polite."
SKAI Bar,4,"The food was great and thank you for allocating us a window side table with an awesome view. I highly recommend the crab cake. I liked how none of the servers made us feel rushed or hurried (because some places do that). And I appreciate how the servers tell us what is what on our dish when it was served, unfortunately because of the mask the words get a little muffled. And also because it was for a birthday celebration, which was indicated during my reservation, but at that point I didn't know if there was gonna be a complimentary piece of cake or will the restaurant put a candle on a dessert I ordered or what. I wished that part was communicated better with us. Because I subsequently ordered a desert after the meal and would have preferred the birthday tag and candle be on the desert (which was delicious) rather than on small piece of complimentary cake. Everything else was really great. I really lucky to arrive at the time when the sunset was happening ."
SKAI Bar,5,"Perched on the 70th floor of Swissotel The Stamford, Skai shows off breath taking views of Singapore whist you enjoy your high tea in style.

Skai brings out the Crazy Rich Asian in one’s self. Very classy with an exquisite ambiance. You are given a choice of the Premium High Tea (SGD 78 per pax) or the Skai High Tea (SGD 60 per pax) with the difference lying predominantly in the savoury selections. Service was as what you would expect from a high end restaurant, perfect.

All in all, if you are looking for a nice posh location at reasonable prices for either a date or a business high tea, this is the place for you! Don’t forget to take photos of the lovely views!

Our full review is on Instagram (@monk3yseendo)"
SKAI Bar,3,"The place was breath-taking. Honestly, it made me feel like a little girl again, dizzy from the gorgeous sights and how amazing our little city looked.

Staff were friendly, the seats were cushiony.

Food presentation was nice too. I ordered the high tea (not the premium high tea bc the only diff was coffee and lobster, which im happy to do without).

But, im giving it 3 stars because the food itself was mediocre. The taste was only alright. Aside from some dishes being presented very prettily, that was it. I wouldnt return again on account of the food. But i would return for the view and maybe drinks."
SKAI Bar,5,"Unforgettable birthday dinner 🎉 Excellent in everything, ease of reservation online with confirmation. All the Staff are very polite, efficient with great knowledge of their products.
Very attentive wait staff, on pouring our white and red wines, never an empty glass. Dishes ordered were served to perfection. Had 3 kinds of desserts, all superb!
The night view from 70th floor is stunning. This has become my top 1 favourite restaurant in Singapore. To the whole team of Skai,, thank you 🙏

(btw staff on the ground floor for temperature check is doing a great job.) Would be nice if there is a nice place to sit while waiting for the ride. You know the feeling when you're so full or had over indulged some great wines and can't stand on your high heels for too long? ☺️or it's just me? (just a suggestion.. Make the area a bit cozy looking)."
SKAI Bar,3,"It is a mixed review, I felt compelled to give a 4 star rating as all but one dish was done beautifully. Unfortunately, it was the star dish that was disappointing. The tomahawk, supposed to be the main show stopper let my whole family down. First, the tomahawk was not trimmed properly for grilling and serving, huge chunks of chewy fats outlined the meat, making it not possible to enjoy the dish. After working hard to get to the meat, it was sinewy and tough. And it was asked to be cooked medium. Totally no meat juices from it, you can see the dryness of the plate it was served on. Celebrity chefs shouldn't be serving food like these. So 3 stars are for the staff's service, a free serving of bone marrow and the rest of the food."
SKAI Bar,5,Nice view-the best view that I have experienced so far for top level view in Singapore! nice food! Considered cheaper price (when on weekday set lunch) compared to other restaurants of its kind!
SKAI Bar,5,"My family loves this place. We reached around 6.45, which allowed us to see the skyline before the sun sets and after the sun sets. The view was beautiful and it was great. Every dish we tried here was amazing. For the starters, we highly recommend the foie gras and the oysters. The foie gras was well cooked, while the oysters had this nice foam layer on top. For the main course, the Norwegian salmon and the lobster and crab pasta are recommended. If you have extra space in your stomach, I highly recommend to get the side of chips. The outside was crisp while having a soft interior. For dessert, you will never go wrong with the baked cheese tart! We love our dining experience here and have been back several times. Service staff was attentive too."
SKAI Bar,5,"Had the dinner set, highly recommended to dine here for the food and the view. Service crews were really attentive too 10/10!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Nice view at 70th floor!
Excellent service, attentive and polite.
Food is decent and presentation is good.
Can consider this place if you're looking for a nice dating venue.
Seen others requesting for special wordings on plate as well"
SKAI Bar,5,The atmosphere - spectacular. Food - delicious. The serving was good too. Weekends are quite crowded hence recommended to go slightly early if you wish to take more photos without people walking about. =)
SKAI Bar,5,"A fantastic experience, food was good and the view grogoues."
SKAI Bar,4,View was superb but many of the high tea dishes were average except for a select few..
SKAI Bar,4,"Booked a dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were given a lovely window seat. Felt that the food was overseasoned, but service is absolutely top notch!"
SKAI Bar,5,"We spent 2 wonderful hours with a terrific Marina Bay view, enjoying  the 4 course set. The appetiser, Blackmoore Wagyu Tataki, as well as the main course, 200g Australian steak were a delight. The intermediate Shiitake Miso Soup was rather average. For desert we tried the Chocolate Tart and Matcha Log, and while the latter was soft with a nice, not too obtrusive matcha flavor to it, the Chocolate Tart was fantastic.
On top, due to a birthday celebration, we were served a chocolate cake.
Overall experience was very good, plenty of highy quality food, and not to forget the unique mushroom butter which was served together with a tasty bread before the appetiser, friendly staff, in a relaxing atmosphere and a stunning view.
A good choice for the special occasion. We would come again. E&E"
SKAI Bar,4,"Amazing views and good service for Easter buffet brunch with Taittinger champagne and some cocktails. Coffee cocktail (their version of espresso martini) was really good!

Definitely more adult brunch but we were very happy to get a round table away from the main dining area! Our kids had enough space to keep occupied and yet stay clear of others!

All dishes were generally good with these dishes standing out: Crab eggs Benedict, Skai steak, pork belly, cauliflower, smoked duck quinoa.

They could’ve done better on the seafood platter (couple of oysters or half a lobster would be nice) and the dessert (nice Easter presentation but lacked fulfillment or selection)... this would’ve made the Skai brunch experience from good to amazing 5 stars!

We were neglected couple of times being seated away from the main area but they were attentive and responsive when requested. Special thanks to Ninho and Hou!

We’d be back again for sure!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Modern space, great service and nice food& drinks"
SKAI Bar,3,"Nice view, food was alright but wasn’t as interesting as expected... relatively experience with single serving of food + 2 drinks... but I must admit that it was a great way of getaway from working from home! Haha"
SKAI Bar,4,"View is nice, but it was gloomy when I went. The high tea has nice presentation, but taste can be even better. Service is fine but can be rather slow when it becomes very crowded. Quite pricey, mostly paying for the view.
You will need a reservation because it is quite popular."
SKAI Bar,5,Saturday branch with million dollar views food was good coffee is great service is excellent
SKAI Bar,5,Awesome food with attentive service staff.
SKAI Bar,5,"Definitely gotta try the lunch set as it's value for money given the ambience and quality of food. Staff were very attentive to your dining, coming every now and then to check the status of consumption so that they can clean up and proceed with next course. Pleasant surprise as a complimentary cake was provided free of charge for birthday! Overall, a very pleasant dining experience with the fanciful desserts to end off. Will come again :) the chicken thigh and steak with red wine sauce are very tender and flavourful. The bread is abit on the hard side, but comes with the interesting mix of mushroom butter. Of course the view is definitely worth it when you are 70 levels above ground."
SKAI Bar,5,"Stellar service and they gave us great seats thanks for everything. It was a lovely dining experience, they treated us like queens xoxo"
SKAI Bar,5,"I like this place the area is very nice and friendly staff, the staff is very flexible because they can change the sit went there has a window sit they will come an ask me to change sit, the food is very nice and well cook and prepare. By the way why I give 5 star because 1 star given to the cleaning of the toilet it very  clean and well decorated"
SKAI Bar,5,"Came here to celebrate teacher's day today. Service is pretty good as usual, food is delicious. Take note that Amax card 1 for 1 pro is not valid for their lunch set meal. Top up $15 for the glass of wine."
SKAI Bar,5,"Awesome ambience, excellent service, superb view"
SKAI Bar,5,"Loved the place, the view and the service. Saturday boozy brunch was great"
SKAI Bar,5,"Fine dining in the sky , great service, ambience and food . Worth the spend"
SKAI Bar,2,"If all you're after is the view, and you don't mind spending >$100 pp on subpar food and service, then sure Skai could fit the bill. To be honest, I went with very low expectations, but somehow the experience still managed to surprise me (unpleasantly). With the exception of a very courteous waiter Zun Hao, all the others we interacted with were brusque and greeted us looking at a screen or anywhere but us. We were informed that tables with a good view should be reserved 2 months prior, and upon further questioning, this became 1 month. So my advice would be to call them and ask at that point if your table with a good view is secured. Otherwise like us, you'll be planted in an area with very obstructed view. Onto the food: the complimentary sourdough loaves were quite tasty, but I didn't care for the overly salty mushroom-blue cheese (?) spread. Be warned that filtered/still water is $3 pp, and a bottle of sparkling is $12. The crab cake ($36) was small for the price, and while the crab cake itself was pretty good, the bed of coleslaw tasted stale and dull. The fish (?) cracker perched atop the dish is presumably meant to elevate this visually, but it reeked of stale oil and was really quite inelegant. The loch fyne salmon ($62) was disappointing. It was underseasoned and dry. The potato mash was good, quite light. But the barley dashi, the cabbage and dill all didn't marry well with the salmon, and were jarring together. The westholme wagyu ($75) was marginally better, reasonably moist, but there was so little char and not a lot of flavor. And the mystery herb dip was extremely dull, it did nothing for the beef. The worst part of the dish was the endive salad, which is just lettuce and endive pieces dropped on the plate and drizzled with a one-dimensional plum sauce. How can this be served? It was really surprising to see plating this way at these prices. Well naturally we didn't care to sample dessert here after these dishes. You've been warned!"
SKAI Bar,1,"Good food and terrible service.
I ate there with Amex Platinum which gives 50% and for a start they put us in a terrible place and said people book a place two months in advance. (Which does not make sense).
After the payment came they did not give us the Amex Platinum benefit even though we ordered from the food listed in the benefit. (The manager said it was an expensive steak)
The manager spoke contemptuously aggressively and raised his voice in front of everyone even though we spoke politely and tried to explain the situation.
I will never go back to eat there and recommend the restaurant to work on its service."
SKAI Bar,5,Lovely place! Would recommend for one time splurge :)
SKAI Bar,4,"Stunning view! Food is delicious and staff are very friendly with the right level of services. Amazing sunset view and night view of city. We went here for birthday celebration and the restaurant prepared cake with candle and the small frame of happy birthday were really cute and sweet. We ordered the dinner set menu, good selections to choose, the cocktail was nice. We will certainly come back."
SKAI Bar,5,"Back when their daycation packages had no restrictions on the restaurants you could redeem your dining credits at, Skai was the popular choice. I tried both the set lunch and afternoon tea. I can only say that the set lunch was forgettable (they didn’t really bother to make it value for money or delicious - I guess because the views and ambience sells itself). However, the afternoon tea featured some of the best scones I had (including the ones I had in London) and a good range of tea choices - that said with the dining time limit we were stuffing ourselves towards the end. Seats and views are kind of luck-of-the-draw, but having been seated in both ends of the restaurant, I liked the view facing Fort Canning (instead of MBS) better because you can take your time to examine the skyline and buildings to your heart’s contentment (or before your dining time limit is up)."
SKAI Bar,5,Fine dining with a good view in my opinion but with good portion.  Lunch set meal always more friendly to wallet..
SKAI Bar,4,This is my Fifth times in three months.  When will you change the menu?
SKAI Bar,5,"Really great view! Most of the staff were attentive and one of them helped us take really great pictures. The food was amazing, so was the plating. We had the Foie Gras, the Seared Tuna & the Pork Belly with Octopus."
SKAI Bar,4,"Really great views of Singapore. We had seats by the window. The whole restaurant was just really pretty.

We had their high tea, $160 for 2 pax."
SKAI Bar,5,"We had high tea at Skai. Absolutely love the Choco Mint Truffle tea and the snacks (less a couple of them). Services provided were excellent, with many of them being helpful and smiling. As I was pregnant, the server also gave a few recommendation to switch certain raw items out. Thanks for the service! :)"
SKAI Bar,5,"Reviewing the high tea: It is absolutely worth every cent. Service is good; the view is obviously amazing but the cakes, pastries, scones and jams are exquisite - like next level good - like better than the view good! - like wow ok!"
SKAI Bar,4,Celebrated my birthday and had a wonderful lunch. Jaime assigned us in a table that is nearby the window to enjoy the view. We were served by Maritess who checks if we are enjoying out meal and was served with a complimentary slice of cake. It made me feem special. Thank you Jaime and Maritess for taking good care of us!
SKAI Bar,5,Good food overall.
SKAI Bar,5,"Had Skai’s high tea and we really recommend it! Skyline’s beautiful, food and decor 10/10. It was such a lovely experience, took lots of photos and was really worth it!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Been to SKAI prior for lunch and decided to check out their dinner menu for a change. The dining experience didn't disappoint of course and the city skyline view was amazing even at night (i.e. perfect backdrop for a romantic dinner). The wait staff were friendly and attentive to our needs - what do you expect if the restaurant's clearly located in a 5 star hotel? ;) They have a wide selection of steaks too and even with social distancing measures in place, they are more often than not fully booked so be sure to make reservations prior!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Been there 3 times, food was good and service as well! You can view one of the best sceneries in Singapore here. Great place for celebration."
SKAI Bar,4,Overall a decent experience!
SKAI Bar,4,By far the best Hi-tea food amoung the best that we have been.
SKAI Bar,5,"Definitely worth the price with nice quality food, view and ambience! Make this your first choice if you have not tried before!"
SKAI Bar,4,Great service and ambience! We came here to celebrate our anniversary. We went for the 3 course festive lunch. Pretty decent but nothing exceptionally surprising. A good place to come for special occasion but a bit pricey for my normal escapades.
SKAI Bar,4,"Located on the 70th floor
Nice view if you are able to get a window seat but limited seats available. Can be disappointing cos you are not able to reserve window seats.
Hi-Tea food pictures captured
Price $60++per pax"
SKAI Bar,1,"DO NO GO !!! Rude and terrible staff we came
With Amex voucher to get 50% discount of our bill and the manager look down on us said we can only choose from the a la cart menu , we did than he said the Wagyu is expensive so we cannot get discount when we ask why the manager Mr Lopez start yell at us and embarrass us in front of everyone , worst dining experience"
SKAI Bar,3,"Service is commendable, and it'd be nice to come here for drinks and/or dessert to enjoy the view, but I wouldn't recommend much else. Obviously there's a premium because of the 70th floor location, but even with Accor 50% dining discount, I still find the pricing a little hard to justify.

Starter of smoked burrata tries to be inventive, but all it proves is that classic Italian flavours shouldn't be messed with. Mains - black cod dish was simple in execution, perhaps too simple, with oversalted gnocchi. Lobster portion was decent but accompanying squid ink spaghetti was pedestrian and lacked bite, suggesting it had been pre cooked and then heated for service. Amber peach dessert was the standout despite not being a signature dish. Great flavours and textures in every component."
SKAI Bar,1,"You book and celebrate your birthday at HaiDiLao, the staff sing HBD song for you. But here, they don’t even bother to say ‘HBD’ but that was okay ."
SKAI Bar,4,"Nice ambience and great views of singapore. Definitely a nice place for dates. Service was good. Very attentive staff. Generally food was good, there were some misses like the tomahawk, salmon and matcha cake. The tomahawk was medium to well done when we have asked for medium rare. My fav starters were foie gras and crab cakes, fav main was lobster pasta and fav dessert was the exotic trifle with lemongrass sorbet"
SKAI Bar,5,"one of my favourite restaurants in singapore for its stellar service, decently-sized portions, insanely gorgeous views — and all for an reasonable price!

went there for the second time with my family for christmas lunch (ordered the Festive Lunch Set Menu) and really enjoyed the service by Marites, who regaled us with her humour and great service. the Christmas Menu is different from their normal menu, but there were some things from their regular menu that you could still order. for me — i ordered their smoked duck appetiser (with pickled mushrooms, quinoa and apple), the miso pork belly with cauliflower, savoury cabbage and crackling, and the caramelised banana for dessert! my favourite dish had to be the smoked duck appetiser, and the caramelised banana comes in a close second. the balance of flavours for the smoked duck was ridiculously good, as was the caramelised banana but the sauce for the miso pork belly was a tad too salty so i tried to enjoy the pork belly without the sauce. the pork belly itself was really perfectly cooked though so it’s disappointing that the sauce brought it down.

one of my favourite things from SKAI though is really their mushroom butter (sometimes i still dream about it really, it’s just that good) but also their mushroom sides! very flavourful and really tasty.

if you’re not really into fancy dining (very understandable really), you should still try SKAI once in your life because their portions are pretty large for ‘fancy dining’ and the views are seriously ridiculously amazing. until now it still takes my breath away :”) love love love

cant wait to go back!"
SKAI Bar,2,"If your aim is the view, the view is stunning. But the the 3-course meal is disappointing. The appetizer of chopped tuna, ponzu and edamame is so basic, I could have assembled it at home. The salmon main was crying for more sauce. The truffle emulsion(it tasted more mushroom than truffle) was too dry for an overcooked salmon steak (despite telling the waitress pls dun overcook). To make things worse- the chocolate tart came with a very hard and dry tart shell, loaded with dry soil, dry crumbs, smear of plum sauce and a sad plop of ice cream which had started melting. The waitress kindly served a tiny square chocolate cake as she learnt it was my birthday. Unfortunately it was also SUPER DRY ... if you ask me, the next time, I will just order a pot of tea and savour the view..."
SKAI Bar,5,"A fine dining restaurant where the unique selling point is more of the view rather than the food, as you're at one of the highest points in Singapore. Try to visit during non peak hours to get the window seat, where you can see almost the whole of the city (even MBS!) from a bird's-eye view.

Food is not bad too but be prepared to fork out money (at least $150++) per person as the menu here is not cheap. Nevertheless Skai offers an unforgettable dining experience and is more than suited for special occasions. Do note the dress code too!"
SKAI Bar,3,"Pros: Great customer service, nice ambience and music, food looks picture perfect, great tea servings
Cons: $$$$, pastries little too sweet and creamy (luckily tea was served generously), advance booking required for good view of sea"
SKAI Bar,4,Nice view! Food deco is nice too. Food taste is ok... its really for the view... good place if you doing a celebration...
SKAI Bar,1,"Terrible experience, it’s a shame as the view is perfect but the service isn’t. Booked in advance and arrived early and was given the only table without view at all. People so come here for that, we also asked several times to change tables as others were free already but not cleaned. Too bad as they are in a hurry to make you pay and leave to accommodate the evening seating but don’t even consider the most important which are the clients. Will never get back to this place as they don’t care at all about their clients"
SKAI Bar,5,"Had our Anniversary Dinner at @skai.sg
Overall ambience was fantastic with great views and good service.

We took the set dinner and were not disappointed.
Caviar as starter, we are definitely not an expert in this but there is no bad smell to the caviar and it isn't too salty. BBQ Quail and Crab cake as appetizers, the quail was savoury and tender but it is a tad too heavy for an appetizer but the crab cake was good, large chunks of delicious crab meat pair with a refreshing coleslaw.

Next was Foie Gras, the portion was big and it was creamy with a good seared. This was pair with crunchy spiced apples and carrots.

For mains, my wife tried the Black Cod, fish was flaky and not overcooked. It was savoury and pair with potato croquette. I got the Wagyu, medium rare, it was well seasoned and tender. The truffle sauce was a nice touch.

For desserts, we have the chocolate sphere and exotic trile. The caramel on the chocolate sphere was a bit too much sweetness for us. With all the heavy dishes, we were definitely looking for something light which the exotic trile brings. Coconut, Mango compote and lemongrass sorbet works like magic after a heavy meal.

Overall rating: 9/10
Great place for the special occasion!

SKAI Bar,5,Really enjoyable spot for afternoon tea! Savory and sweet bites were all really delicious and you can’t beat the view (:
SKAI Bar,3,"A few minutes walkd from my block. So if you don't feel like going to big yet crowded mall, this can be a good alternative. It has a number of  stores for basic shopping needs with good food options."
SKAI Bar,5,"Booked on the tuesday itself for a birthday lunch, and there was rightfully no seats available by the window. Wanted to order a 4 course lunch set for sharing but was politely requested to have another main since its 2 persons dining and proceeded to ordered another 2 course lunch set. Had asked for a window seat for the occasion and an available seat was provided after some guests left (Special thanks to Opertaions manager Ulli). Had a great lunch with a great view though the food is so filling, its good and definitely worth for creating memories."
SKAI Bar,4,"Lunch set 4/5
Price 4/5
Service 5/5
View 5/5"
SKAI Bar,5,"We were seriously impressed with the quality of the food, the service and the views, even though we didn't have a window seat. Slightly expensive but so so worth it for a special occasion. Note that it can get a little chilly so you might wanna bring a cardy."
SKAI Bar,4,Had high tea. Awesome view. Average food.
SKAI Bar,4,"Being on the 70th Floor, it allows me to have a great evening view of the city. With high ceiling and tall glass, it creates good ambience for SKAI. The food was not that fantastic I must say and fortunately my wife is an Accor member, we have 50% discount for the food. The service is not up to standard as the staff are either short handed or not attentive enough. When the bill was called, we were given the wrong bill and fortunately we border to check the bill first. They did apologise but I don't expect this service from a high class restaurant that I took it to be. In some restaurant, if they found their service lacking, they may just give a free gift or dessert as gesture to delight the customer.   I was walking with crutches and none of the server bordered to bade me farewell and see to me as I walked up the flight of steps to the lift. Bad experience for me as i thought SKAI is a good place for me to enjoy a high end meal and chill out. Sigh!  Definitely not value for money."
SKAI Bar,5,Amazing ambience and the views are just stunning
SKAI Bar,4,"A bit of a walkaround trying to find the Covid-restricted entrance (need to exit the building; it's next to McDonald's). Great views and food from the à la cart menu was good. Mentioned in the booking the lunch was to celebrate a belated birthday; the chocolate square with a candle & personalised message  was a nice touch. Staff at the lobby was overzealous in saying we had to wait outside (""crowds are not allowed to congregate"") even though it was just the 2 of us waiting barely 3 mins for the driver the come round - service staff need to be better trained to exercise discretion in low-risk situations. Overall, an enjoyable lunch."
SKAI Bar,5,"Great service, great view and delicious food"
SKAI Bar,3,"The only selling point about this place is the view. Fantastic high floors full length windows.
Food, however, was just average. Nothing wow me at all. It was rather under seasoned. Good for dating but not for foodie."
SKAI Bar,4,"Was here for the high tea, book a week in advance and we got like a semi private room (maybe because we said we had 4 adults and one infant) so the restaurant nicely arranged us to be away from the main group incase the baby cried. Which I felt was really considered of them. The table however, was too big for 5 pax.

Service was pleasant but not as fantastic as everyone mention in the reviews. We had to keep searching for staff twice.

Price point wise it to the pricey side however worth it for the view and value of the food items. Setup of the high tea is so Instagram worthy. Would recommend to try out Skai and I would visit again as the view is amazing!"
SKAI Bar,2,"I feel very disappointed
Spent $870 to get such experience
I was make a reservation two week ago
Due to all the good review
I been SKAI on 2/11/2020
I reach at 7:00pm
I was wait for 20 minute till my turn to make an order
While my friend reach
Need to wait again
They are shortage of manpower !
The manager tell us that beef need to wait for 30minute but end up we was waiting for almost two hour
And when they serve the beef
It was over cook
So we request to change and we wait for half an hour again
Same the pork belly that I order also over cook
Honestly, other then the moscato is nice
The other food really terrible
This is not a 5 start restaurant standard"
SKAI Bar,5,Love everything. Food and view. We keep coming back here  ❤
SKAI Bar,5,The views here are fantastic. Food is also good. Service very attentive
SKAI Bar,5,Very nice food. The lunch set menu is reasonably priced. Great city view if you're seated near the windows.
SKAI Bar,4,"View and ambience was perfect! Food was mediocre. We had the cod, lobster spaghetti and burrata which could be better!

Cocktails could have more oomph to it too."
SKAI Bar,4,"Fabulous view. However, the steak is too chewy due to the tendons. I believe this is not the usual case. My friend ordered the same steak, but got no problem."
SKAI Bar,4,5 ⭐ for panoramic view of singapore.  food was just average but the service was attentive and prompt .
SKAI Bar,5,Great view and skyline of Singapore's Central Business District. Pleasant dining experience and attentive service staffs.
SKAI Bar,3,"I cancelled my reservation due to no window seats available..... after reading all the comments/ reviews in google map, I guess I will not be able to have any chance anymore to seat at the window except previously during Equinox & Compass Rose time... Those were the days with good memories.... maybe for SKAI, those seats are reserve for VIP and hotel guests only... Anyway thank you."
SKAI Bar,5,"Beautiful view at night and food was scrumptious - menu is fused with Japanese cuisine. The foie gras and shiitake miso soup... unforgettable. Took a while for the main course to arrive but they kindly offered us something to drink while waiting and a dessert after. I wanted a table by the windows, however it was fully booked so we sat at the inner area. Right before dessert, they asked if we’d like to change to the table right by the view. Excellent service and I enjoyed every second of my dinner!

My love and I had an amazing time, we truly enjoyed ourselves!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Excellent view of the city and we get to enjoy the day view, sunset and night lights as we arrived around 6.30pm.

Service was great as she was very attentive when needed.

Dinner was lovely, but the beef was was rather cooked even though we requested for medium.

Will definitely be back again to try their set lunch or dinner when there is one. Wanted to make reservation on National Day but it’s already booked for an event, otherwise it will be a really great place to view the fire works and the performance at the Padang."
SKAI Bar,5,"Great option for a romantic meal with one of the most beautiful views of Singapore's CBD. Food was excellent, especially the giant Spanish red prawn. Service was warm and responsive. Highly recommended for date nights :)"
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent view! Good food
SKAI Bar,4,"Great view, great food. Had a corporate dinner there and the supposedly oily looking pork tasted especially awesome. Will definitely seek this place out again and try out their other food and wine."
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing service! The staff were very attentive and took careful note of my dietary requirements. Despite the rainy weather, the warm setting, good music and good food made for a lovely Saturday afternoon. Would be great if there was an a la carte option instead of just the 'buffet' options."
SKAI Bar,4,"At the level of 70 floor overlooking Marina Bay and financial street while taking your meal.. awesome. Ordered pork chop, beef sampling was really fantastic . The service is wonderful and attentive. Wines selection is not too bad.. you can even find the Lebanese wine. Worth to spend a nice evening with loved ones and enjoy the view. Great place for all occasions !"
SKAI Bar,5,Stunning views and sumptuous meal. The decor of the desert done for the birthday was very pretty. Restaurant staff made the celebration memorable. You can enjoy the views of Marina Bay and have drinks at a height of 70 floors. Make sure to reach early as table with awesome views gets filled too quickly.
SKAI Bar,5,"It was a most memorable dinner cum birthday celebration. We were attended almost hand and foot by the handsome waiter who helped us take marvellous photos and gave us good recommendations from the menu. We enjoyed the pomelo salad, chips, sea bream, scallops and the trifle very much. What is really nice is the standard bread and mushroom butter. They even offered another loaf! And of cos the view is stupendous, especially at sunset! Love the new decor compared to the former Equinox. Highly recommended for birthday and anniversary celebrations!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Awesome service, beautiful view of the singapore central business district skyline and food is good as well. Definitely a lovely place to dine in and a great place to create special memories as you watch the skyline transform when the sun set in the evening into a dazzling, bustling city of lights."
SKAI Bar,2,"The Food is good. service is not the best but acceptable. One of the bad thing is I believe Swissotel reservation cheat us or purposely hid the truth.
During the reservation we asked for a window table. However, the reply was that hotel cannot guarantee the window table. This implied to us that tables were given on the first come first serve basis. when we went in there were several empty tables near the windows and we've been told that those were given to the peoples who reserved prior to us as they also requested the window tables.
This means, Hotel knew that there are no window tables that at the point of our reservation, yet they continued to lie to us saying it may be available. Main reason for us to go to Skai was the view. If we knew that having such not possible we wouldn't go there. I would have canceled the reservation and turn back at the point that there are no window seat, But I didn't want to create any dram on our wedding anniversary"
SKAI Bar,5,"Love the view and excellent service from Skai. They emailed and told me they are fully booked so they can't fulfil my request for a window seat. Nevertheless on the day itself, we were pleasantly surprised that one of the staff lead us to our table with a breathtaking view of MBS and the sea.

Such an unexpected gesture coupled with their friendly and high standard service really made our day. Thank you Skai for the wonderful and memorable lunch."
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing place to bring your date to. Food pricing might be on the high-end but the quality makes up for it. Ambience was also well worth the visit, including the city view. Staff was friendly and makes you feel welcomed."
SKAI Bar,4,"Dinner with the view of Singapore. No matter be here for meal or for drinks, here is interesting enough to try. Come with more budget will be a good idea. For window table, better to reserve in advance, yet there require about SGD 150 per head for window table as of the time I visited.

Contemporary grilled with modern cuisine for both its taste and presentation. Nice services.

Good food with impressive view but not that to die for anyway."
SKAI Bar,5,"awesome view from the very top of Singapore, I would say this is the only place which can give you the best night view of SG and hospitality of staffs was indeed admirable !!🤩"
SKAI Bar,5,"Afternoon tea, literally sky high! Had an amazing English high tea with friends at SKAI Bar, located on the 70th floor of @swissotelthestamford

The newly launched afternoon tea set, served on an exquisite floral tier tray, has an interesting spread of sweets and savoury items. Think along Maitake Truffle on Flatbread, Foie Gras Polo Bun, Candied Black Bean Sesame, Matcha Tea Mascarpone and Cocoa Bean Ruby Chantily. It is on the pricier end but for the view and the spread, I think it’s quite worthwhile.

Afternoon Tea Hours:
Sunday to Friday 3:00pm-5:00pm

Pricing:
$60++ per person"
SKAI Bar,5,Yummy food! Was there for anniversary they even gave me a special cake. Thank you so much~
SKAI Bar,5,Great bar.  Great view. Great food. Very attentive staff.  Sitting at the bar is a treat because you can watch the bar tender work his magic like Tom Cruise.  The food is fantastic as well.  Lots of steaks to choose from if that is your thing.
SKAI Bar,5,Set lunch is value for money. Great view with good service. Food is good with details to the setup and presentation.
SKAI Bar,5,"Came here for my birthday. With a window seat, we had an absolute killer view.

We ordered the signature 5 course set menu. In a nutshell, each course was perfection on a plate. The tastes melded together perfectly. None of the courses unbalanced each other. By the time we finished dessert (chocolate tart), we were happily full (not those stuffed until you wish to die kind). Would definitely recommend this place for a special occassion."
SKAI Bar,5,"Lunch menu is reasonably price for its ambience and the food served. Atmosphere is perfect for business lunch or romantic dates. Fantastic coconut dessert which wow me, grilled baby bass is just so so but the starter on cured Salmon is great."
SKAI Bar,5,Nice restaurant for high tea with a view.
SKAI Bar,4,"First time at Skai, nothing in particular stood out among the dishes. The starter bread spread was unique. But we had a good view during the national day rehearsal. One thing to note, some tables are really long and the service crew kept asking us to pass things to them or receive. During the full house seating, the crew wasn’t as attentive."
SKAI Bar,5,Awesome place with a great view  great food and great service.
SKAI Bar,1,"Reserved for high tea 1 month in advance but didn't get a good seat. We were seated far in the restaurant that has limited view of the skyline, dark and low ceiling. A place with such terrible aesthetics that they didn't even show the part of the restaurant on their website. Would have been a lot better if they could tell us about the seating arrangement if its a less than ideal place, esp since we booked 1 month in advance. My seat was facing the wall with a painted fish on it that doesn't seem to fit the theme of the restaurant. The atmosphere is only nice when you are at their main dining area (the place with the bar infront of the glass. Once seated, I requested for a change in seat but was told that its only for people who reserved early. Unfortunately, it seems like 1 month isn't early enough.

As for the service, the person who served the high tea set didn't explain the food that was on the plating. I had to personally request a staff to come and give us a run through of the dishes. Not very professional. Under-staffed? Possibly. They also do not serve tap water. The waiter said only Sparkling or mineral water which would cost $3. I'm quite surprised that even tap water was not available at such a fancy restaurant despite my meal per pax costing over $90 after GST. But nvm, at least we have our tea.

The food is great, but we have more value-for-money high tea at other hotels and restaurants. Each of the item on the high tea set has a very strong flavour of its own. The chocolate however was too strong for both of us.

Overall, not a place that I would recommend, nor a place I would return back again."
SKAI Bar,3,"Staff are excellent. Food variety is limited. Its a beef place, and felt is not fine dining as it was with equinox before. Never coming here again. Has a kids menu with only 3 items. The bread that was served had a crust like a  rock."
SKAI Bar,5,"Really really nice view from top of the building (70th floor! ) You will see the entire city , overlooking Marina Bay sands.
Staffs are very professional and super welcoming.
Food is not cheap. Just be aware !
Also , recommend to book way advance (1month ish) and come on time! You can ask the staff to get window seat if it's available ."
SKAI Bar,5,"amazing view high up from level 70!!
the food was also great and the staff were very personable and polite"
SKAI Bar,5,"Great views as expected. Set lunch deal is good value for money - 49 SGD for starter, main and desert. Desert was the highlight. Staff were attentive and friendly and made sure my wife’s birthday was recognised with a candle and some chocolates. Cocktails were great and unusual."
SKAI Bar,4,"There’s not many restaurants in Singapore that can match Skie’s amazing panoramic views of Singapore. It’s enough to take the breath away, especially when the sun sets and city’s night lights begin to sparkle. Once seated, your expectations for the food begin to rise in the hope it can match the high quality of the views. Luckily for us the food lived up to our expectations. The risotto was creamy and delicate and topped off with a deliciously fresh sea urchin Uni. The salmon fillet was soft and subtly bursting with flavour under an enjoyable crispy skin. The pork main was also deliciously and surprisingly soft and juicy whilst still being crispy. The meal was very enjoyable and the service very professional and polite, but like the venue, expect prices towards the sky high range. If you’re looking for a memorable venue and a meal for special occasions (a birthday cake was delivered to our table at the end of the evening, even without asking for one) Skie promises an evening to live long in your memory."
SKAI Bar,3,"I would have given a star review if is not because of the Excellence Service provided by the Asst. Manager, Mr Nino Gestoso.
I was impressed how he rescue an upset customer like me that almost walk out of the place feeling lousy and terrible.
I was contacted last week that my reservation was able to bring forward the timing without informing me my request of window seat will not be met unless booking done 2 months ago. If they did, I would have postponed the reservation. Afterall, the purpose of getting up there is to enjoy the high tea with good view for the price you paid for.
I am glad Mr Nino attended to me patiently listening to my frustration and apologized of such unpleasantness. He assured me any chance to get me a window seat,  he will do so.
And indeed, I left the place feeling satisfy and a Big Thumbs Up to
Mr Nino of his superb and professional service that I am totally impressed."
SKAI Bar,5,Beautiful scenery from the window! Food also awesome. Especially the beef ribs. It was out of this world.
SKAI Bar,5,"hosted our business event at Skas, burrata with fennel, avocado, blood orange and crispy chickpeas for starters, roasted artichoke risotto with blue foot mushroom &chive butter , roasted veggies. exotic trifle with coconut , mango compote, lemon grass sorbet as desert, nice experience"
SKAI Bar,4,"Excellent view and service. I wish there's just simple pan browning on my steak instead of grill lines, but otherwise everything else was delicious."
SKAI Bar,4,"Unique tasting food couple with great view. Price is on a very high side. The minus side was the somewhat rough service. Overall, it was a very good experience. Recommend to come in groups for drinks and scenery views."
SKAI Bar,5,"Very nice place for dinner. Service is great, staff is attentive and also very in tune with recommendations if you're lost in the menu. Wine selection is broad and would probably satisfy most picky connoisseurs. Spread of steak is moderate. If you love unadulterated beef for the steak taste then this place is a meeting at try.

Had a sampler selection and all three cuts are distinctly different and darn good in their own manner. Wine pairing was also excellent for the steak. The cabineros prawns was also delicious.

Recommend that you book early for a window seat to watch the sun set over the Singapore skyline if you're from out of town. Gorgeous views. Come early at 6pm to study the menu, and get recommendations if you get lost like me. Service was impeccable. Nino gave great recommendations and aided an excellent evening.

I would come back again !! Highly recommend Skai !"
SKAI Bar,4,"One of the best dinning experience at the such height, probably the highest. Great food, lot of options both in food and drink. The set menus are great and value for money. The ambience is great for twosome or family dining. Highly recommend to try!"
SKAI Bar,5,Gut-warming and Heart-warming.
SKAI Bar,3,"View is fantastic! Food is overpriced and mediocre. Overall it’s disappointing

Grilled lobster is fresh. However the pasta tastes like a normal cafe standard

Cod fish is nothing special

Crab cake is nice

Oyster is super small

Bread&truffle butter tastes so so"
SKAI Bar,1,"We have had the WORST celebration for my brother's birthday in Skai restaurant; and honestly speaking the entire experience is really bad.

We have planned to celebrate my brother’s birthday in Skai on 21 Sep 2020. From reservation to confirmation calls, and for more than 3 times, we have requested for seats with view and a small piece of birthday cake. DISAPPOINTEDLY, nothing was prepared in the end…

Skai, please check your guest request’s record book.

We feel cheated by Skai when we were given a dark corner seats that can't even see any views despite they said ok and will arrange for it. We were cornered to a table just able to see the heads of all other diners and nothing else. See pics.

So what's there coming to Skai restaurant for???

For goodness sake Skai, if a guest has requested many times for seats with views, which means that's important. If you can't guarantee it, please reject it and don't say ok, will arrange. Best in service industry is to ""under promise and over deliver"".

Upon arriving Skai at 3pm, I have asked the serving staff the 3rd time if the small piece of birthday cake is prepared. They said yes. And we waited until 4:45pm (ending) nothing is being served. We were made to feel like we were begging for a simple birthday cake.

OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SKAI = No unparalleled view, food is cold, need to ask several times for hot water for tea refill, need to ask sugar for coffee, begging for birthday cake which never came...

Service is really bad.

Anyway, the birthday celebration with bad experiences with Skai for today is over. We can't buy back time anymore.

Skai not worth it… Really!"
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent great food and friendly service
SKAI Bar,5,"outstanding views, service, vegetarian food and ambience

epic views from everywhere you seat in this amazing arena 70 floors up

the service was great, smart, fast with a smile

they had a lovely 4 course vegetarian menu which was delicious, they pair with wine although we wen for the $98 Tattinger which is a bargain in Singapore!

great place for business lunch or romantic dinner or drinks by the bar

already booked my next trip!

highly recommended"
SKAI Bar,4,"Great 4 course and fantastic ingredients. Except that the miso soup might have been too salty to taste, for a restaurant of this level to serve."
SKAI Bar,4,Affordable and good value lunch sets with awesome view of Marina Bay area.
SKAI Bar,3,"The view is great (I guess that's what you're paying for) but the food and service are just.. alright. Was expecting a bit more for the price range. We've had better (and cheaper) afternoon high tea experiences elsewhere, so won't be coming back."
SKAI Bar,3,"Made a reservation on a Sat night, 2 weeks before National Day so that we could catch the fireworks display during the rehearsal. Had some trouble locating the restaurant as the concierge was not at the front desk, leaving us roaming around aimlessly. The view is undeniably beautiful, visible thanks to the large glass windows. But it ends there. Perhaps they were overwhelmed that day but the service was poor. There were mutilple times through the meal where we had to resort to raising our hands to catch the attention of the staff, simply because we've waited too long for someone to give any of us eye contact (all 4 of us). The food was nothing spectacular, only the foie gras dish was tasty. I think this place relies heavily on their location because service and food isn't their strong point. Restroom is also 1 floor down, maybe 2 flights of stairs. So not recommended for elderly or handicapped unless they have a lift. Will not return as there are many other places to catch the same view of Singapore, with better service and better food."
SKAI Bar,5,"Went for afternoon tea at SKAI, which is located at 70th floor of the hotel. You need to take the lift from the back of the hotel lobby. It is not easy to find and without noticeable signature but the hotel staffs are more than welcome to show you the way.

You will be welcomed by the breathtaking view once you entered the restaurant. At SGD68++, you can induge in the delicacy and choice of two TWG premium tea or coffee. Some teas and dishes will require additional top-up.

Overall a fantastic experience at SKAI. Will revisit for the dinning experience on special occasions."
SKAI Bar,3,"Food was okay, had 4 course set menu, with wine pairing. Last 2 wines were served when I’d already finished my food.
Manager on the floor had poor attitude due to our inquiry about credit card deals. Could have used better mannerism. Nice view, but otherwise, nothing special."
SKAI Bar,5,Great ambiance with scenic views of the Singapore skyline. A great place to have an intimate dinner or a group celebration. The Exotic Trifle is a must-try dessert!
SKAI Bar,5,"Update: Jan 2020
Came for their set lunch, service was excellent. However food was not really up to standards. Paid extra $20 for beef but the cut is quite bad. A lot of tendons and couldn’t really chew it well. Dessert was fancy and their signature coconut mango item but didn’t really suit my tastebuds.

Previous review:
Very interesting cocktails with fancy (and sometimes unrecognizable) ingredients. Ranges $25-$28. 20% off for Amex platinum cardmembers. Superb views at level 70, high ceiling and dim setting, perfect for dates :)"
SKAI Bar,4,Beautiful scenery and good personal service makes this a memorable lunch experience. Food a tad pricey though.
SKAI Bar,5,Came here for a saturday semi buffet lunch and the spread was more than semi actually. View was amazing so always try to get window seats! Service wasn't too bad given that this place is usually full house. Perfect for special occasions.
SKAI Bar,5,Beautiful view from level 70. I like their executive lunch set - it was a delicious menu at reasonable price.
SKAI Bar,5,"Excellent food and service, as always"
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent food served here with the bird’s eye view of Singapore.
SKAI Bar,5,Great view great service👍🏻. Enjoyed my night there. Do go early because it's hard to get a seat since limited... Go experience this place yourself!
SKAI Bar,4,"Glorious views, high ceilings,  a very relaxed feel, topped off with charming hosts/ servers.

We went for the afternoon tea and had been told  that they could accommodate our request for no dairy. Sadly it felt like we were given a set of ten+ fruit compotes/, jams/ jellies, a basket of sour dough bread. All of which were good (a couple really good) but you get outstanding jams etc. elsewhere and this felt underwhelming given the standard of afternoon teas these days/ their regular tea menu (and what we saw everyone eating). The savory items(barring one which was very good) felt sweet which was unfortunate given we'd just had 10+ jams. I know  they were accommodating us but this felt below the standard so taking off 1 star (although the food was probably 3/5, maybe less for this price range).

Given the service, the place itself, I'd love to go back and be surprised positively by the food and upgrade my review."
SKAI Bar,4,"Pricey but great food, great view and great service. The chef came out to cut up the steak which was a nice surprise. We ordered the tuna, fois gras, black Angus strip on the bone, and the triple chocolate. The steak and fois gras were cooked perfectly."
SKAI Bar,5,"The view is amazing. Went for high tea and spent a very lovely afternoon. The tea set is nice, could use more savoury picks, but overall pretty good.. you go there mainly for the view anyway. Also.. really nice homemade strawberry jam :D"
SKAI Bar,5,"Food was good. We had the oysters, heirloom beetroot, lobster squid ink pasta, and cheesecake. Service by Maristes was tops. Only downside is price is rather steep unless you have a discount."
SKAI Bar,5,Set lunch with an amazing view
SKAI Bar,4,Good view with not-too-bad service staff
SKAI Bar,4,"This is place you would want to go if you want to see the whole view of singapre business district. The ambience is amazing with great staffs to ensure that all your food needs are met. In terms of food, it is above average for some dishes and some dishes are just average. However the view and ambience make up for the food choices. It is a good place to go and have a quiet and romantic dinner and you can talk to your partner with no disruption. The desert options is not bad too, worth trying them. If only the food served here would match up others restaurants of the same calibre, this place would definitely deserve a 5 stars ratings. Nevertheless Still a great place to visit!"
SKAI Bar,4,"Spectacular view of Singapore. Servers were pleasant and took our orders but had to wait for sometime to get bill! As the 2 lady servers were no where to be seen and bartender was not attentive enough to see pass two customers at th bar! My party of 3 were there from 5.30pm to 7.20pm and we had drinks and food! This was on Thursday 24th Oct. My host is Singaporean and with 2 of us foreign, Australian n Malaysian. Our 1st visit to Skai."
SKAI Bar,5,"Great food, great view. However I feel that service is abit slow and it can be quite hard to catch the staffs attention sometimes as the restaurant is quite long in space. But not a big deal, will definitely recommend! Will recommend to try the signature miso cod, the signature crispy noodles nothing much to shout off honestly. Uni risotto is not bad too, considering I don’t eat uni. :)"
SKAI Bar,5,Lunch semi-buffet has a good variety of fresh seafood. The view and excellence service also add to the wonderful experience.
SKAI Bar,5,"Came with family and the view is simply stunning. It's enough to come here just for the view. Perfect for couples as well, very romantic. We ordered the Festive Lunch 3-course meal and it was good and satisfying. The mushroom butter was amazing, we couldn't get enough! Best part was the service by Marites - thank you so much for the good conversations and for the stellar service"
SKAI Bar,5,"Pretty damn special. Came to Skai for a lunch with my aunty, the place is absolutely stunning and the view takes your breath away. The lunch set menu is really well priced with the pork dish being a real highlight. Depth of flavour and cooked to perfection. The Wagyu beef was nice, but lacked a flavourful crust. The service by Revenzi was next level, super attentive, polite and just impeccable. Ambiance is lovely and decor was on point. Would love to come again if I lived in SG"
SKAI Bar,5,Haven't been here in years. Still as magical.
SKAI Bar,2,"Surprised to get such terrible service at this restaurant, it seems that the waitress did not get what we asked for most of the time, was not attentive to the 4 tables she was manning,  and when my friend asked for pepper for the pork belly dish, we waited for 15+ mins and she only came back with the pepper after seeing us staring at her. And look at this pepper in a dish! How are we supposed to apply it?! Has she considered the customer’s perspective?"
SKAI Bar,4,Nice afternoon tea with an obviously fantastic view.
SKAI Bar,5,Awesome view. I went for the high tea premium package. Definitely worth the money. Must try at least once!
SKAI Bar,5,"Excellent view, service n food. Super good deal lunch set."
SKAI Bar,5,Watched the F1 race here in 2018. Incredible views. Definitely worth checking out.
SKAI Bar,4,"Excellent service throughout, and a spectacular view. The best dishes were unfortunately the appetizers (the octopus being one of the best I’ve had). The steaks were however not a standout. We both had steaks from their signature collection. The steaks were grilled to perfection, however definitely not one of the best I’ve had."
SKAI Bar,1,Ambient is good food is normal but the service stuff is very unfriendly overall dinning experience is not satisfied due to the staff attitude. Definitely wont recommend
SKAI Bar,5,Best place to have a drink in Singapore. Make sure you go there around sunset to enjoy the view and the city by night
SKAI Bar,4,Very stunning and breath taking view with presentable food presentation which is also quite exceptional. couldn't ask for more with this experience
SKAI Bar,4,Dined here for our Anniversary.. For an additional 20$ you get the window table with excellent views of the city from the 70th floor.  The lighting is perfect for a romantic evening and the food and service was outstanding
SKAI Bar,4,The service is really good here.
SKAI Bar,4,5 Star for ambience and service. Food is so so. Feel that the food concept is very similar for every dish I had. Main + pickled veg/fruit with puree
SKAI Bar,5,"Definitely one of the better skyline restaurants around! The steak is amazing, portions are good and not forgetting the MBS view is just breathtaking!"
SKAI Bar,5,"Great atmosphere and view! Also, many thanks to the team who specially reserved the window seat at a quiet corner for my partner and I, and the complimentary drinks after knowing we are there for our anniversary. Glad we picked skai bar, and we will definitely be back!"
SKAI Bar,5,nice food nice scene!
SKAI Bar,4,"Good view. Had the lamb rump. The serving is quite small, but taste was okay."
SKAI Bar,5,Generally nice but the view is the highlight. Singapore City view at your feet!
SKAI Bar,4,"you can see very nice view the Marina bay and
High rise together.
and can try nice food also
but the restaurant a bit old"
SKAI Bar,4,100 points for the view. Food quality so so
SKAI Bar,5,6 mth old restaurant that replaces the Equinox. almost all the seats have splendid view of southern Singapore coastline as well as the civic distric. atmosphere was nice and complimented with excellent & attentive staff. quality of food was on the spot. the set lunch was value for money vis-a-vis the ala carte menu.
SKAI Bar,5,"Had a really great experience at Skai tonight. Food was great. The crab cake was really delicious, way better than what most restaurants in Singapore offer. Definitely worth a try! The service was excellent too. Demi served us through the night and was really attentive. She also helped snap a few good photos. The view is, needless to say, to die for :)"
SKAI Bar,4,Nice bar with views of the wet of Singapore and can see Indonesia and high rise of Johor. Nice sunset views. Reasonable selection of their own cocktails at S$25-28++. Service can be a bit slow. They ran out of nuts!
SKAI Bar,5,The nice ambience wins it all together with the warmness of all staff. A great place to unwind and feels good after visiting. Went their for the high tea. Nice plating. Taste wise nothing much to comment as I believe the ambience and view is what we were there for:)
SKAI Bar,4,"Scenic place fer a nice date post dinner at Mikuni (check out our pics in an earlier post), prefer it to its noisier counterpart upstairs. Had a bottle of champagne and a bottle white. Happy Camper with the view :)

Service may be improved as sometimes the wait staff can be preoccupied. However, when they do see you, they are good :)

I believe there is a good discount with the Amex FAR card."
SKAI Bar,5,Food and Service are great!
SKAI Bar,5,"Excellent place for a romantic date or a special occasion. The view is amazing. Initially, a table near the the glass windows was unavailable, however, later on staff were kind enough to transfer us to the table. That was very thoughtful and we really appreciated this guesture.

Food is very good 8/10.
Customer service is 10/10.
Overall value for money 9/10"
SKAI Bar,4,"A million dollars view (and $3 table water).

TBH, I think this is one of the best places you come for Singapore skyline.

Ordered beef and lamb steak(Per dish approx 70$z). Not mind blowing but not too bad either. Something quite expected of restaurant at this price point.

They have some champagne specials from Monday to Friday. Approx 98$ per bottle. Not too bad.

Would I go back for the food? Maybe not. But definitely for the champagne and view. Get the bar seats, those are the ones with a better view."
SKAI Bar,5,"Love the facade and menu, want to relax have a nice drink and try duck liver stew..superb"
SKAI Bar,2,"5 star views, 3 star food, 1 star service. Staff are not interested in you, they seem to be in a hurry to disappear to the back kitchen. They also don't much cater much to any dietary needs and the (high tea) food selection is hit and miss.

Went for high tea on a weekday, upon arriving at the place, we were greeted with great views, but it went downhill from there. We were somewhat seated away from the windows, and when we politely enquired if there was any other seat, we were met with a curt response from the staff ""seats are pre-arranged"". Once seated, we noticed that most of the servers can be seen hurriedly running out with the food and then running back to the kitchen without paying attention to any customers. We were left trying to waive down the staff to get our order in.

One male staff belatedly took our order and seemed extremely impatient. He did not offer any assistance whatsoever, did not introduce the menu. He also did not ask whether there were any dietary restrictions. He seemed in a hurry to take our order and leave.

Service of the high tea rack was quick, the server who served us introduced the items like reading from a script in an almost robotic way. We were left staring at the rack while waiting for drinks to arrive. We thought oh maybe they need abit of time to prepare the drinks. But after a further 10 minutes there was still no sign of the drinks. When we finally tried to enquire about the drinks the male waiter replied in an irritated tone - ""its coming!"" and just left. We were flabbergasted.

Drinks finally arrived after a few more minutes of waiting. Due to my lactose sensitivity, I had to ask the server if they had any soy milk to go with my tea, but disappointingly I was met with another curt response - ""we don't have soy milk"". Point to note that one day prior to the high tea, I received an SMS reminding me of the appointment and also enquiring about any dietary restrictions. I did reply to this but there was no response nor any subsequent action taken by the restaurant to address it.

Up till now the service we received was extremely disappointing and way below our expectations.

Food wise, the savory items were hit and miss, scones were a tad dry and uninspiring, quiche was nothing fantastic, there was an egg mayo type thing which was way too overpowered with truffle, the foie gras item was not to our liking as well. For the sweets, the chocolates and cheesecake were good. Portion wise it was very filling and we struggled to finish the food. Drinks (coffee/tea) were nothing to shout about.

One of the more senior staff was a little more attentive and seemed to notice that we were not very happy and tried ask us what happened. Later he tried to offer us champagne but we declined. He then later offered us some additional pastry. Kudos on his part but the damage was already done.  Seems that their staff are not well trained and do not know how to handle customer interaction properly. Service is also disjointed between the timing of the food and the drinks."
SKAI Bar,5,"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday celebration. Service was one of the best that we've had. Overall a very pleasant experience. We ordered the tenderloin as our main (it was pretty good,though not the best we've had). Highlight was the free flow seafood counter yumyum. Not to forget the wonderful view from the restuarant as well"
SKAI Bar,4,Nice service but the new menu is not that great.
SKAI Bar,4,Great ambience and awesome view of the city. Food is okay. Good for celebrating milestones
SKAI Bar,5,"The service is super nice, and receive this surprise from one of the staff. She said that it's complimentary as they heard the word “happy birthday” from our table. Super recommended."
SKAI Bar,4,"Highly recommend the brunch.
Of note was how attentive the service staff were."
SKAI Bar,5,Nice ambience and friendly staff. Had a wonderful wife's birthday there. Food is wonderful.
SKAI Bar,5,"Came here on Amex fine dining promo. Extremely worth the money - the view is one-of-a-kind (especially at night time!!), and the music is just loud enough for conversational privacy while not being too imposing. The hospitality was really warm - we were offered a bar seat for a better view after we first sat away from the window. The steak was delicious and tender, even better than some of the higher end teppanyaki I've had. But our favourite memory of the night has to do with the light hearted conversations about alcoholic drinks with the bartender Kingston - thanks for your amazing concoctions and the personal touch!

Highly recommended and will be back again."
SKAI Bar,4,Ambience is great and you get the best view of Singapore skylines
SKAI Bar,3,"Service was abit slow, not sure if understaffed. But when we sat no cups were provided for the water for a good 10 minutes - had to request before it was given.

Went for a birthday celebration and they provided a small cake. Overall not too bad food, but great view."
SKAI Bar,4,Really nice ambience but can be quite uncomfortable to be sitting on the high chair throughout high tea. We had the high tea set and most of the items were executed well. We can’t decide if we liked the sweets or savouries better! Only issue was the currency of their website on credit card promotion as the staff told us the website information was not updated.
SKAI Bar,2,"Food was ok, but was charged 12++ for a bottle of sparkling water. Dont mind paying for water at a restaurant but 12+ (without prior warning) is way too high."
SKAI Bar,5,Nice place to have buffet brunch. The food is fantastic. Price is at high end.
SKAI Bar,3,"New restaurant after Equinox closed down.
The view is great, however the restaurant is a little dark, which made reading the menu and figuring out what you were eating a little difficult.
Not sure whether this restaurant wants to be a communal sort of restaurant or more fine dining. The pricing is fine dining pricing, however they do not have set menus. Items from the appetizer list were sort of difficult to share, especially the crispy rye noodles.
We really enjoyed the miso cod.
The lamb shoulder was also decent, served with (surprise!) Sweetbreads.
We ordered the steak for two. It's doneness was perfect and it was very succulent beef, but unfortunately there was hardly any seasoning, so it was a little on the bland side. Once asked for salt and pepper, it was perfect.
Service was excellent.
#localguides"
SKAI Bar,5,"We had the 3course set lunch, value for money. Food well executed. Mr Leo was very friendly and attentive too. Will be back!"
SKAI Bar,5,Top of Singapore view.
SKAI Bar,5,"Went for their lunch set meal, choices was alright and service from the start to end was excellent. Food was very yummy too!

(Just on a little disappointing side was the request to put a birthday candle at the birthday girl dessert was not being fulfilled. Requested at the counter when I reached the restaurant first ☹️)"
SKAI Bar,4,Great view especially at night. Beef steak  is huge at 300g. Love it with the mushroom sauce. Black cod average. Would have like that they continue to serve tap water. Used to serve a selection of bread options but no more. Slightly disappointed.
SKAI Bar,5,"Very great restaurant with a lovey staff. A stunning view of the skyline to top it off.

They really took care of my party. Everything we ordered was delicious."
SKAI Bar,4,The chocolate tart with brandy ice cream is really good
SKAI Bar,5,Cocktail of Great Food & Great View... !!
SKAI Bar,5,Amazing staff and delicious food. Always a great experience at Skai
SKAI Bar,5,"Service was great and professional. Food was great too, naturallt abit pricey. It's worth it for the food and experience. View was amazing, atmosphere and design was spot on. They gave a complimentary cake for my birthday too!"
SKAI Bar,5,Great weekend brunch!
SKAI Bar,5,Great city view and good food!!
SKAI Bar,5,"Ambience and view is amazing - perfect for personal gathering, business meetings or just a sit down sip tea and enjoy the skyline of Singapore. Tea time delicacies came as a surprise with taste and flavours coming in - staff are warm and attentive!"
SKAI Bar,5,"very good cocktails, surpassed only by the stellar views. i expected the cocktails to be overpriced due to the location and views but was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t vary from the usual $20-$25 of signature cocktail bars in sg."
SKAI Bar,5,"Fresh n good n bird's eye view of Singapore river,above 7o flr."
SKAI Bar,5,Very very good. This place is nice surprise. ideal for a business dinner.
SKAI Bar,3,"It could be an amazing experience thanks to the stunning view and a very nice dinning room but my dinner has been slightly wasted by the attitude of some waiters (almost agressive, impatient and very familiar calling me buddy and my guest by funny nicknames).
The food is nice, nothing to criticize in the plate. The wine pairing is too expensive for the quality / quantity of wine and they charge you 12 sgd for a bottle of water!!!!
The restaurant closes at 10.30pm.... they’ve served our dessert at 10.10 with a glass of wine and chased us at 10.30. Rude...
Good for a lunch but i think u can find a much better place for dinner"
SKAI Bar,1,"Extremely disappointing evening at SKAI.  The restaurant and view is gorgeous.  That's about it.

Booked the only available slot for a 9:15p seating. Upon arrival no one was at the front and it seemed they were understaffed.  We were seated and then had to wait about 15 minutes with our masks on before anyone spoke to us. Then the server made a comment about how we were having a bit of a ""late dinner"".  The place was empty when we arrived at 9:15p and we would have obviously preferred to get an earlier reservation.

Ordered a sharing cut for two at 900g and asked for medium.  45 minutes later, it came out beyond welldone.  It is unacceptable for a steak place to overcook a $160 steak. We didn't want to do it but we sent it back and of course, had to wait another 45 minutes before we could eat. And at this point everything was rushed and pressured.  To clear drinks off the table, to eat and get out of the restaurant, to settle the bill.  Overall, it was not enjoyable, not delicious and only memorable in a negative light.

Perhaps an off night for them, but at those prices I expected so much more."
SKAI Bar,3,"Beef was good.

Stanbroke Porterhouse is a sharing for two. We had to wait 45minutes to be served. It comes with 900g of beef, we chose medium and the midpart of the beef tasted just right. However, the sides can be a lil overcooked causing it to be too hard.

We also had two sides, hand cut fries (potato) and mushrooms. The sauce truffle mushroom was the best.

However, service at SKAI was soso for the price. They were attentive at first and definitely friendly.

However, we ordered for extra sauce but it didn't arrived at all. Then, we brought our own birthday cake but was told that we would be charged extra if we were to eat there.

When we asked the waiter to serve our cake, it took more than 20minutes and we had to remind them twice. I think he didn't understood that we brought our own cake and brought a menu and asked if we wanted deserts. Generally it would had been a wonderful experience if the service was faster and not to forget our request.

Overall, it was a longggggg dinner. It became tiring at the end.

I would have expected better service with the amount I've paid, I would not choose to return again despite the gorgeous skyline of Singapore."
SKAI Bar,5,Amazing view and food
SKAI Bar,4,"Skai offers a panaromic view of the city skyline. The night scenery, coupled with the exquisite cocktails, made for a memorable night."
SKAI Bar,3,"People go to restaurants for a number of reasons, some for the view, some for the ambiance, some for the service and some for the food. I would probably go back to this restaurant for the first two reasons, but not for the last two."
SKAI Bar,4,"Smoke duck and steak is very well done, and nice view"
SKAI Bar,4,"Best view, great service, after AMX credit card discount, the price is quite reasonable."
SKAI Bar,5,Great food and view!
SKAI Bar,5,The view was awesome. You can see the entire Marina Bay and the eastern side of singspore from it's vantage point. Semi-buffet lunch has a wide selection of food.
SKAI Bar,5,This is a nice place for anniversary High-tea.
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent food and wonderful atmosphere
SKAI Bar,5,"Great ambience,  well crafted drinks and food. Service from staff member April was impeccable. Will be back!"
SKAI Bar,4,"The food was delicious. Being on the 70th floor of the Swissotel, the view from outside the window is beautiful! However, my luck turned when it was raining. Thankfully, all was made up when the lights lighted up and the view was like an array of party lights. There were green, blue, red and purple lights everywhere. This place is usually full on the weekdays and Saturday, but not Sunday, and is mainly a place for wine lovers or drinkers. I would probably come back a next time."
SKAI Bar,4,"Beautiful views, nice ambience and very polite staffs...😊"
SKAI Bar,5,Nice view of the city skyline. Friendly attentive staff
SKAI Bar,3,"High tea timing was pretty short from 3pm to 5pm. Before 5pm they started to chase us out to prepare for dinner service, and asked us to settle the bill at 430pm. At 5pm they said we needed to vacate asap. Food was decent."
SKAI Bar,4,"Great view, ok food but nothing remarkable."
SKAI Bar,4,"Best view restaurant!!
Good food. Nice and profession staff
Must visit!!"
SKAI Bar,5,"One of our favourite restaurants with excellent food and a gorgeous view of the city. The staff are friendly and professional, and they always go out of the way to please."
SKAI Bar,1,"Service was terrible at the front desk on the ground floor. Because the restaurant had not opened we were asked to wait at outside in the hot sun. This is unacceptable service! They were not apologetic about that but just chased us out.
Next, the service of the lady taking us to our table was horrendous. We had booked a window seat but not only was she unapologetic when we were not at a window, she just said this was the best she could do given the that other people had booked the window seat much earlier than us. This is terrible service.
It takes forever to get service at the table as well.
The Indian and German waiter had better service"
SKAI Bar,4,"Amazing view, attentive caring engaging staff. Simple delicious food, good wines. Great at sunset."
SKAI Bar,4,"Came here for the 'half-buffet' on a Saturday with 4 friends.
Service was great, we were well-attended to.
The buffet element was fine: lots of choices especially sushi and seafood, breads and dips. But my main course was disappointing: corn fritter with salsa. Seriously lacked seasoning and flavour. That was the only vegetarian main choice.
Anyway, come here for the views, the wine and the dessert buffet, it's all wonderful."
SKAI Bar,4,The price is on the high side but the food is good.
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent ambience and view .
SKAI Bar,5,The ambience and the friendly service staff.
SKAI Bar,5,Ambience was amazing! Food was chefs kiss and excellent service from Zun Hao! 101% worth it!
SKAI Bar,4,"Price reasonable for set lunch.  Go for the view!  Food is decent for the price, dont expect top notch.  Ask for the main dining hall, not the Skai Suite section."
SKAI Bar,1,"Food was ok but service is the worst I experienced in Singapore. They have quite an attitude when serving people. There were two people at our table and they only gave us one glass and looked at us as if it was only one of us there. And when we asked to pack our food, they said you should have told us earlier. We chase been coming here quite often and this time is really irritating. I don’t think this kind of scolding, condescending type of tone and rude attitude are worth the hype. I will strongly encourage everybody to stay away from this place."
SKAI Bar,4,Obviously a spectacular view and the ambience is also very nice. Service was good but think price slightly above what I would have expected to pay. Went for the 5 course and wine pairing $260pp.
SKAI Bar,2,"I’m not usually in the habit of writing overly critical reviews of F & B outlets (I just don’t return to the ones that disappoint off the bat) but after what my party of 4 unfortunately experienced tonight and at the stinging cost of 145 ++ per person no less, I felt compelled to detail my extremely underwhelming experience at Skai and caution future unsuspecting diners. And I want to point out, that while we kept our expectations in check (as you must often do with these kinds of places), we really wanted to be reasonably impressed.

Walking in, we were seated at what we jokingly ended up referring to as the “naughty corner” of the restaurant, where it was neither set up intimately for 4 people, nor was it comfortable to sit longer than a half hour, especially on the odd, inappropriate lounge chairs. Unlike all the other tables it seems, so must have just been our bad luck! Given this establishment trumpets itself as a high-end venue, the staff could certainly benefit from some appropriate level hospitality training. I don’t mean to sound like “that a***ole”, but how to properly lay cutlery, serve courses/dishes is etc, to a level everyone expects (and should do so), is part and parcel when you pay this much. Or at least that’s what I remember. And if they have indeed been trained, perhaps a serious re-evaluation then?

Now the food. Plenty of misses and barely any real hits. I was struggling to appreciate the smoked burrata cheese. I mean, if the Mainland Vintage Cheese you’ve had on your toast at breakfast leaves a more memorable taste in your mouth than this supposedly exquisite product, then please give me my supermarket saver any day. As my wife exclaimed in shock when we got home and I pointed it out to her, “there was pesto in the starter!!??”, I think that says something. And when you can instead turn two humble (read tiny) pieces of cauliflower into the star tasting component of your starter (that’s right, not the wasabi pesto, not the smoked cheese, not all those supposedly normally flavourful elements) that is seriously weird and definitely mis-spent cooking talent!

It’s not hard to put together a decent coleslaw these days. Not in the era of cooking shows and YouTube how to’s slapping you sideways on a daily basis. Worst case, let KFC be your guiding light. That memo apparently didn’t make it here. Now I was willing to let all these faux pas slide and figured the mains might make up for it. Unfortunately, I’ve never had chicken breast so bland unless I was going to boil it in unsalted water and feed it to my cats. Even the soy peanut sauce was powerless to alleviate (forget elevate) it. How it escapes chefs not seasoning meats at any level of cooking, has to be made illegal. My friends couldn’t make even make it halfway through their lamb rumps for one clear reason only – it was woefully under-cooked, even downright raw at the centre! We know all about lamb being cooked pink. That wasn’t it! When our waitress came to clear our plates, noticed the obvious unfinished meals and enquired why, her first response to our comment and disappointment was to giggle uncomfortably behind her mask. She did ask if we wanted it taken back and re-cooked. We would have preferred the chef come out and explain to us his/her avant-garde cooking style. Were we even meant to get served something like this in a supposed high- end joint? Never mind running the risk of food poisoning consuming raw food.

We’ve also had 5 dollar matcha ice creams taste more macha than the matcha logs that were served. That’s the plain truth. And the other chocolate dessert? Nothing to write home about. It seemed like the sugar was the spotlight and everything else a side show. Because a giant kick to our collective palates and wallets wasn’t enough, just for another slap in the face at the end of a very disappointing night (with no effort made to make up for the awful lamb main courses at least)……..a 3 dollar charge (before taxes) per person, for plain old water!

Never again and buyer beware. Absolute pie in the sky."
SKAI Bar,1,"Made a reservation online the night before for 2pm, however, the next day they called us and said they wanted the table back at 2:30. Eat lunch in 30min? No way! Also no explanation was given. At that time I was out, thus just quickly changed the booking to 1:30. After thinking about it, realised that it was very unreasonable, and called the restaurant. Was told that they could only extend our time there. Afterwards when i went back to their website, realised that lunch ends @3pm. This was on their website in very fine print. Very dissatisfied with the level of service from such a prestigious restaurant."
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent food with excellent views. Don't miss  this place.
SKAI Bar,5,"Food was great, service was great."
SKAI Bar,1,"Terrible service.
1. When we asked for water, the waitress only gave us 1 glass when there were of 2 of us.
2. We could not finish the food. When we asked the waiter to pack the food before we left, the waiter gave us a strange look and said ""you should have mentioned earlier"". I do not understand what is wrong with packing? and How can it be done earlier?

I had a very unpleasant high tea experience at SKAI. Not gonna come back again."
SKAI Bar,5,Awsome ambience and food.
SKAI Bar,3,"Celebrated my son’s 18th birthday here tonight. The food was good but the service was a little lacking. The wait time between when they cleared the appetiser dishes and serving the mains was over 30 mins. They didn’t leave the bottle of still water we ordered on our table, so I assumed they would help us top up our water glasses. But nobody did so, and we had to grab it from the shelf next to us and top it up ourselves.

We enjoyed the view and the experience for this special occasion. But as a family, we all agreed that we won’t be making a beeline to return anytime soon."
SKAI Bar,5,Amazing view with perfect food
SKAI Bar,1,"Expensive normal food quality with very bad service.. the waiter no smile their face like owe him million dollars..

Not worth to come here again.. if you want to make yourself angry and have a bad mood for whole day, you are more than welcome to come and try it yourself.

Might as well go MBS Spargo... trust me.. don’t be a fool to come again.."
SKAI Bar,4,"Nice view
Good service
Price range - high
Is worth for try 👍🏻👍🏻"
SKAI Bar,5,The view is amazing! The staff are very friendly and attentive.  We were there to celebrate my hubby's birthday and our 20th wedding anniversary. The staff is so well thought and prepared little chocolate tag with Happy birthday and Happy Anniversary on our desserts. We were served 2 glasses of complimentary coffee liqueur cocktail for our anniversary. They even took a Polaroid photo of us and gave us a postcard wishing us Happy anniversary. Thank you do much for the kind gesture and it's really a memorable night for us. 😘
SKAI Bar,4,"Skai usually delivers and more than expected; restaurant itself and the private lounge area are well set up to meet different needs. We've had numerous corporate events, dinners, gatherings to personal hi teas and birthday celebrations, most turned up in smiles and high ratings. Just only for one occasion where we were offered below par service when trying to customise a corporate family party that includes children of various ages. Coordinating Executive was rigid and unable to suggest creative and refined options. That was quite a frustrating process till the Manager and Head stepped in to resolve the situation. All's well end well luckily!"
SKAI Bar,5,Porterhouse steak. Sent from the heavenly cows. Paired with a good red and it really distracts u from the awesome view!
SKAI Bar,2,You came here fo the view NOT for the poor quality food. Very disappointed
SKAI Bar,5,went here for a special occassion. awesome service and good food!
SKAI Bar,5,Food and ambience was a 10. Sauces for the oyster and steak was so good!
SKAI Bar,2,"The ambience and food is so great! But the service of a waitress quite disappointing. Upon arrival we were informed the side window seats are not available which i understand. Subject to availability..therefore I request if anyone leaves can I have the seat. The waiter say yes sure! So we order 4 course meal, coffee and a bottle of wine. Soon we reach our dessert time, there are guests leaving beside us which is the window seats! Hurray! So we quickly inform the waitress who is available that point of time. She say ""oh I'm sorry I have reserved for my guest"" who is seated in front of me and arrive later than me. So I told her I have requested from the first waiter who attended to me. Her reply was no? I have check and nobody mention that. And then I told her it was my wedding night I got married this morning I can show her my marriage certificate. So it is a very meaningful and important night for me. She still continue to reject me oh I'm sorry I have promised my guest. Emm so he is your guest. I'm not the guest. Well, so I told her I want to talk the waiter whom serve me earlier on to see if he can help me for my special day. That is when she willing to do the check for me and agree to give me the window seat. But after all the unpleasant comment my guest my guest. It is quite sad on my wedding celebration..due to covid we are not able to have a luxury celebration. Hope the management can look into it that this is not a discrimination as the other guest is Caucasian while me and my husband are Asian. We hope to be treated fairly."
SKAI Bar,5,Spanish Octopus and Wagyu 😍
SKAI Bar,5,6 stars.
SKAI Bar,2,Nice view but there will be people keep reminding you that they need the table for dinner.
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing view, had a wonderful night with my wife! Service was good. Food is yummy too."
SKAI Bar,1,"Don't waste your time. Nothing polished about this place. The scenary, while really nice, could not make up what was a low quality experience. Tables presented with no table cloth. Uncomfortable seating. Unattentive service. Food presentation way below expectations. Food taste was mediocre. Seems to be like a cafe type deal. The worst was the price of the experience $200+ for 2 pax lunch with no drinks. I reminisce about the very first restaurant - Compass Rose - at this same location."
SKAI Bar,4,Good quality of steak and an excellent view which is always nice for special moments. The wine pairing does compliment the beef well while the dessert was a delicious way to end our night. Do wish they had more options for non seafood lovers as zero chicken on the menu but the beef selection did help 😊
SKAI Bar,5,"The lobster and tuna starters were well prepared. Be sure to order the uni risotto for your main, as well as the pork belly. The yuzu peach and brownie desserts were great as a finale!Spectacular views. Great atmosphere. Great food - the steak and chips and pork belly were delicious. Not to mention the wonderful selection of desserts. Great Service. The DJ was brilliant. Finally a decent alternative for Saturday brunch in Singapore. Highly recommend."
SKAI Bar,5,Awesome place great ambience great service
SKAI Bar,2,"Really slow service even though the staff were friendly enough. Waited to be seated as there was no one at the counter. After seating us, hostess completely forgot about us and the menu took ages to come. We waited pretty long for the food too."
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent food and service and the view is to die for!
SKAI Bar,4,"nice ambience nice place
high tea was average only though and i didn't get a window view btw"
SKAI Bar,3,Only there for the view and ambience. Food is unimpressive. Previous Equinox food was much better.
SKAI Bar,3,Nothing to shout for. Food is alright. Service staffs are polite and professional. Nice ambient and view.
SKAI Bar,4,"Great ambience and view from the restaurant! We reached around 6:30PM and were able to catch the sunset.

Expected more from the food though, considering the prices. Service staff were all really friendly. Overall, a nice place for special occasions."
SKAI Bar,5,"Attended a 5-course wine tasting event. Liking the new decor and ambiance, very earthy and airy. The view is still spectacular so come for sunset drinks or early dinner. Food was great, slightly unseasoned maybe because of the wine tasting event. Service is very good. Pro tip. There is a smoking room on 69, next to the restrooms."
SKAI Bar,3,"Amazing location with great view.
We had dinner and when it comes to food.... I would say average. Much better experiences around the island. Lobster spaghettini were ok, beef was not tender and not well presented at all for the price tag and restaurant level (my wife was about to send it back, lowest point of the dinner). Starters were ok but portions are really sub-standard (starter for starters maybe 😁). Dessert was ok but again, nothing special and presentation was very average.
Not impressed, I would only recommend it for the location and view as long as you can secure a window table."
SKAI Bar,5,"Food, wine, view. This is the place"
SKAI Bar,4,"[Classical view of Singapore skyline ]

It is traditionally known to be best view, and it's recently renovated the interior which made it more modern.

High tea is up to standard but the tea pots were not served at the same time with savory and desserts. It came out lukewarm after we are half done with all the mini sandwiches and scones. Second tea came out hot luckily as we asked to ensure it is not cooled down. The amount of the tea is not full.

Service in general is ok but they perhaps need more training to know the order or service.

Wish there is more dark chocolate kind for adults' taste but the dessert is not overly sweet. So it is worth a try. Kids set is quite worth it."
SKAI Bar,5,"Highly recommended. Great food with amazing view of Singapore famous skyline. The staff were very attentive & knowledgeable, the food was excellent. Had a wonderful time. It is a great place to celebrate any occasion or first (of many) date."
SKAI Bar,4,Delicious food + nice view + good service worth the expensive price-tag with S$150/pax minimum spending requirement 🤑 Enjoyable 10th anniversary dinner S$400+ for just two adults with signature Crispy Rye Noodles + mushroom-butter bread 🥖 + still-water + two non-alcoholic drinks + cod-fish + beef tasting plate + matcha pancake 🥞
SKAI Bar,4,Very nice decor and good lunch menu
SKAI Bar,5,What a very cool ambience! The view is amazing! I enjoyed my food while watching the view. You must visit this place!!
SKAI Bar,5,"Brought my mum and family to this stunning venue for her birthday cum mothers day celebration. We were seated near the window ( the best spot in my view) and the view is simply breathtaking. Seeing the sun setting amidst the thick thundery clouds was magical. The service was superb and faultless. It was really top notch service ( hence my handsome tips). I would like to single out Thao Nguyen who served our table and did a superb job. All other staff were courteous and friendly. The food was tasty. I ordered the Tasting Beef, the best beef I ever tasted in the town- so far.
Venue, Food, Service - all top notch and scoring high, something hard to find even in Singapore.

I will definitely return."
SKAI Bar,3,"Excellent service, staff are very friendly and polite. Very good attention to detail and presentation. Food quality and taste is 6/10, based on my last two visits. The quality has dipped in the last 3 months and sometimes dishes are not even served at the right temperature."
SKAI Bar,4,Great food & views!
SKAI Bar,1,Nothing great about the food or the service here. Good view though.
SKAI Bar,2,Went on Sunday 10.30pm almost 11pm with my overseas guests. Kitchen was closed so only left with drinks. Not crowded but didn't get the attention - Need to waive multiple times for the service staff over. Other than the view don't think I'll come here again. Cocktails are mild.. Taste like fruit juice 🤔. Preferred anti:dote.
SKAI Bar,1,"We had the Crab Spaghettini and Alaskan Black Cod as mains. The cod was cooked to perfection but the former was an utter disappointment. Crab meat was too salty and the prawn was half raw. Upon clarification, we were told that it was meant to be that way. We've had seared prawns but it was nothing like that. For the price paid for, we would probably visit here for drinks only."
SKAI Bar,3,"The food service is so slow that I could have climbed up and down the 70 stories and the food is still not out..

Food is decent but we spent more than 2 hours for a 3 course meal. After we were done with the main course, our plates were left infront of us for more than 30 mins unnoticed.. Had to resort to informing them to clear the plates on my own. For this price - this place definitely needs to improve their service and waiting time."
SKAI Bar,5,"Excellent view, fantastic food, minimal crowd. Went for 3 course meal at $49 per pax. Considering what you'll be getting it's a steal. Great attentive staff and service as well. Definitely recommended and for any occasion."
SKAI Bar,1,"At the corner of the bar,  some ppl were having their company event- so it was literally too noisy and not pleasant to stay in that bar. When I was booking they should’ve notify me that there will be some private party on- If I knew upfront, I would not book it!
Plus, their staffs were more busy making photos at the bar instead of taking care of their clients. We had to put so much effort to get their attention if we want to order or request for the bill.
Lastly, there cocktail taste was nothing special, I wouldn’t pay such money for tasting that quality of cocktail.
Only good thing about this bar was the view and yet you can get much better view at some other bars."
SKAI Bar,5,"Nice Ambience, perfect view, good service and good food 😋"
SKAI Bar,4,"Food is good, service is excellent, but really the high prices you're paying for is to enjoy the gorgeous view."
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent view and quality premium food
SKAI Bar,4,"High end restaurant with one of the best view of the city. Absolutely perfect for a romantic dinner or if you want to enjoy the fabulous view. The food is not perfect as the view, but anyway really good. Exceptional quality and almost perfect staff service, a place to back to, but not really often."
SKAI Bar,4,"Excellent service, food is only average"
SKAI Bar,4,Delicious food. Servicr could be more attentive. Some little touches missing for a high end establishment.
SKAI Bar,2,"just wanted to express my deep disappointment of my dining experience yesterday 6.12.19 at 1pm at your skai restaurant. after having your confirmation that i CAN eat gluten, dairy and seafood free i must sadly confirm  that it was NOT easy to do so!
i could not eat any starter and the only one the chef made an effort of offering me was a plate full of salad leaves with a heap of  onions rings!! with hardly any salad dressing. it is very easy to make a good salad and not only  salad leaves with loads of onions.
further to my main course the chicken breast and the sides were cold and not well cooked... the waiter offered to bring me another one although i insisted it is not necessary because by the time it came my friends had all finished eating  and i ended up a eating alone!
last but not least no need to mention that there was no dessert for my dietary requirements to be served!
all in all a very very disappointing culinary experience for such an overrated and expensive restaurant i am afraid. i understand it was a very busy day and the kitchen surely must have been exhausted however this should not be the guests problem!
very slow service. the main selling point is i guess the fantastic view."
SKAI Bar,5,Cristian and his team really looked after us for my wife’s birthday on Friday. From the set menu beautifully paired with carefully selected wines to being able to deal with 18people doing musical chairs between courses it was superb. Of course the views help but we had so much fun I hardly looked. Whatever F and B GM Emmanuel Benardos is doing now with the f and b in these properties it is surely working. Thanks to all at Skai
SKAI Bar,5,"A business colleague wanted me to have a really great experience in Singapore. So she booked us for a traditional afternoon tea at this restaurant, which I discovered is located on the 70th floor of a hotel across from the Marina. There was a thick fog during the time we were here, but the view was still unbelievable. A huge chunk of the city is laid out below."
SKAI Bar,5,Good ambience. Good service. Not too loud that you can't hear yourself. Great views.
SKAI Bar,5,"Nice place for a high view on Singapore , drinks were good and finger food was awesome , friendly staff and good vibes"
SKAI Bar,4,Very attentive staff who made sure that the champagne flutes are always filled. A pleasurable dining experience with a wonderful view of the Singapore cityscape.
SKAI Bar,5,The WOW effect.
SKAI Bar,5,"Had a great lunch at Skai Bar. Food was awesome and the view is fantastic. Overlooking of Singapore skyline. Even all the staffs are friendly and very polite and helpful. Jaime was really nice that he even made us special mocktails for us to try and its great. They even go beyond our expectations with their surprise for me and my husband. Overall, Thank you to everyone! Good job!"
SKAI Bar,5,lovely dining experience!! amazing view n food (my favorite crispy noodle n sea brass bamboo)  n attentive staffs esp Kingston that serve us always accomodate our needs. thanks! will come back for sure
SKAI Bar,1,Tried to book table of 12 including 2 people with dietary restrictions that were not specified by the menu. Initial email response was to send me the menu. I requested further detail but had no response to help accommodate. Think anyone who would need any help with dietary requirements should be aware of this.
SKAI Bar,5,Stunning. Was on a business trip and had dinner in this restaurant... views of the city out of this world and the food amazing. A bit pricy though to eat up there daily so a walk outside with local restaurants were a life saver. Otherwise this is top of the range restaurant...fine dining.
SKAI Bar,5,"Loved it !
We had a great anniversary with a wonderful lunch"
SKAI Bar,5,Lovely views of the city. Very relaxed and welcoming ambience. Great food and wines.
SKAI Bar,5,"Like always,Excellent!"
SKAI Bar,5,Love the view!
SKAI Bar,5,"Great ambiance and fantastic service. From beginning to end, everything went perfectly from host staff being quick and very friendly, to our server being very attentive, to fantastic food.

The view alone makes it worth a visit and you can easily plan dinner around the light show that takes place at the Gardens by the Bay that is seen from the restaurant.

In my book - it's definitely a dining experience worth the splurge."
SKAI Bar,5,"We booked Christmas lunch here and didn’t regret it. Apart from the amazing views of Singapore, the food was amazing, plentiful and a very good menu with both buffet, carving station and a la carte tasting menu. Service was very good, in particular Tata who looked after us every well. Free champagne and cocktails really flowed. The carol singes, magician and balloon lady were an added positive addition and we also had a fun visit from the big fella himself. Overall a very enjoyable experience with only a couple of small feedbacks to the team. The buffet needed to placed in a different area and in the centre of the room so as to avoid the long queues. The music after the Carol Singers would have been good to have stayed in the Christmas theme. Neither of these two things negatively impacted our enjoyment though and would highly recommend. Well done."
SKAI Bar,5,Fantastic location and views. Exceptional selection of wines.
SKAI Bar,3,"Settings, view and ambience was spectacular. However the service left much to desire. Food was above average but doesn’t live up to its price"
SKAI Bar,5,Great view and great food. Service was amazing.
SKAI Bar,1,Seated at 12noon. 1.30pm and main not served yet. Everyone seems to be enjoying their food and only we  are like 2 fools looking ard with no updates. Wont come here again. The place looks the most 40% packed with people.
SKAI Bar,1,"Asked for a table by the window, made reservation 3 weeks prior - stated that it was a birthday celebration. When we got there we were given a table in the corner and took 15 mins before any server actually showed up to take the order. Definitely do not recommend."
SKAI Bar,4,"Fantastic view of the waterfront, food and service is good but price on the higher end."
SKAI Bar,4,"Attended a corporate event at Equinox and they were serving a 3 course meal. Food was certainly very well received. Salmon main course was perfectly executed with flaky, firm yet juicy flesh and a very flavourful accompaniment of pumpkin purée. Excellent food, attentive service. One star shaved off only because of the poor A/C!"
SKAI Bar,1,Expensive
SKAI Bar,5,Breathtaking views.  Awesome place to have strategy meetings
SKAI Bar,4,One of the nicest steaks around. Great service by Jamie (cant remember how to spell his name). 4 stars because we requested for medium doneness but was served medium rare to rare.
SKAI Bar,5,Perfect place for cocktails...
SKAI Bar,5,Fantastic view. We could see as far as Malaysia and Indonesia as it was a clear day.
SKAI Bar,4,Awesome views. Decent food and excellent service.
SKAI Bar,4,Very expensive
SKAI Bar,5,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary at this place, lovely view of the city while having our meals.

We had oysters and foie gras for starters, best decision ever! The oysters are fresh and of a generous size, while the foie gras is just delicious.
We had the beef for our main course, good cuts and cooked to our preference. Lastly, the desserts were pretty and delightful. The sorbet was light while the chocolate mousse was rich, both paired well.

We happened to sit at the window seat beside a faulty blind which cannot be lowered, thus the sun shines in quite a bit while I was having lunch. It got quite warm and I was sweating in an air-conditioned restaurant. The stuff was nice enough to help us adjust our table and chairs so that I can move to the shade, slightly better but still warm.

Overall, we enjoyed the dining experience and we are definitely coming back!"
SKAI Bar,4,The view here is great!
SKAI Bar,4,Nice deco. Food is good but not the best steak. The view is nice too
SKAI Bar,4,"First time there to explore Night City Views ,it's was great!"
SKAI Bar,5,Love the view and food taste good too
SKAI Bar,2,"Great food and ambience but service was horrendously poor for a supposed fine dining restaurant. Requested for a window seat during booking but was only informed that it was unavailable when we turned up. Requested for a second drinks menu as we had a party of 3 but was ignored. Drinks failed to turn up and had to be reminded. I ordered a medium steak. Nobody bothered to check for the doneness of the steak. When I told the waiter that the steak was rare, no apologies whatsover was given. This was not our first visit to Equinox. The food has always been good to great, but the service never fails to disappoint. Quite a pity for such an establishment."
SKAI Bar,5,Nice view of the city and pretty good food!
SKAI Bar,5,Great dining experience. Had the set lunch.
SKAI Bar,2,"GOOD VIEW but POOR services, lack of manpower, food got not much refill, no one picked up the used plates. Semi-buffet ends 2:30pm, no waiter or waitress served for tea/coffee. When we requested tea/coffee slightly after 2:30pm got rejected. I will never ever go to this restaurant again and will not recommend this restaurant to my friends."
SKAI Bar,3,"Had their lunch set steak, ordered medium rare but it was overcooked when delivered. Other items are generally pretty okay."
SKAI Bar,5,"Jaslyn and Jaime were wonderful hosts! Food is good, view is great!"
SKAI Bar,4,Nice ambience 70 floors up with savoury food.  Fusion food lovers a must visit.
SKAI Bar,5,The food are too yummy
SKAI Bar,4,"The service was excellent. The food was good but nothing fantastic.
The best part is the view and that’s what makes lunch quite pleasant."
SKAI Bar,5,"Food & Beverage

SKAI is a lively contemporary grill, situated on the 70th floor of Singapore’s acclaimed Swissotel The Stamford. Iconic city views, seamless service and bespoke beverages create the perfect ambience from which to savour Executive Chef Paul Hallett’s finely crafted menu of sharing dishes, all of which feature a truly personal and progressive touch."
SKAI Bar,1,Horrible customer service. After arriving we were met by the hostess who told us to wait a few min until she could find a table for us after which she disappeared. Then we had to wait 40 min because as she explained later she forgot about us.
SKAI Bar,5,"Good dinner venue, especially for the personal touch from Tiffany - Highly commended for her hospitality & superb service. 👍"
SKAI Bar,5,Nice dinning place with stunning views
SKAI Bar,5,nice view n excellent beef.
SKAI Bar,3,"The old buffet spread was good, but the Ala carte menu is not value for money"
SKAI Bar,5,Worth to try and enjoyed with pleasure fantastic food and view
SKAI Bar,4,Cool view 😎
SKAI Bar,2,One star for the view and second one for drinks. The food served for Saturday brunch is really bad quality.
SKAI Bar,4,Great view! Good food!
SKAI Bar,4,Nice view
SKAI Bar,5,Amazing place..Amazing view from 70th floor and that place have delicious food.
SKAI Bar,1,"Visited to celebrate a birthday but it was nothing but a VERY DISAPPOINTING and UPSETTING experience.

1) i made a dinner reservation 3~4 weeks in advance. By the time we arrived, it was pretty early and there were only couple people seated. Still, we were seated at the table right beside the entrance (yes it was still by the window but there were like 10 other window seats available at the time). When I asked the staff/manager if we can move to another table, they said it was reserved and did not let us move. I was not happy with this becuz 1) we also made a reservation weeks ago 2) people for those tables did not show up until an hour later 3) even if they made a reservation, my understanding is SKAI does not guarantee any preferred seats for you. For these reasons, I felt that the restaurant is not treating us as valuable customer as whoever seated in other tables. At least if any additional explanations were provided, we might have not felt the way we did.

2) we ordered 1 appetizer and 2 main dishes. Again, the place was not crowded at all by the time we ordered the food. However, it took about 45 mins to get our first main dish. I don't know if this is normal in this restaurant but none of the other high-end restaurants I've been to in Singapore is THIS SLOW. I was very close to just cancel all our orders and leave.

3) probably it goes the same for any other restaurants like this...but the portion was really really small. We ordered 3 dishes including 1 appetizer (for 2 pax) but the portion was too small that my stomach didnt feel a thing.

I visited here to enjoy my evening and to celebrate a birthday but ended up having a nightmare. In fact, it was one of the most terrible dining experiences I ever had. This is srsly my first time leaving a negative review in this length.... I am definitely NOT going back here and WILL NOT recommend to anyone, especially for a special occasion. With few hundred bucks I spent here, we would have had much pleasant experience else where. I even apologized to my fiance for taking him here for his birthday..."
SKAI Bar,4,Ambience superb. But food wise average
SKAI Bar,5,Nice place and very nice view to see..
SKAI Bar,5,"With good view, good food and service."
SKAI Bar,5,Best view while eating extraordinary food
SKAI Bar,5,"Stunning view, good service. Set lunch was good and reasonably priced."
SKAI Bar,4,Nice food and view
SKAI Bar,4,Look very ok.
SKAI Bar,4,"Great Afternoon Tea Spread.
Easily one of the best Afternoon Teas around with a gorgeous view from up on high."
SKAI Bar,1,I went there  with my family this January 2019. We arrived at the restaurant on time.we talked to the lady at the front of the restaurant we needed table for 3. She said just wait 2 min and left.So we waited. We walked to where windows were and looked at stunning view and took some photos  to pass the time. It has been well over 15 min of this waiting around. Then we speak with another lady in the actual restaurant and she tells us it was past 21:15 and they dont take any customers after that and food can't be ordered after 21:15. We were devastated.  We came just in time and waited for over 15 min to be seated. Then they found the staff who told us to wait. She just said she thought we had reservation and then she forgot about us. Thats all. The customer service was horrible. They themselves made the mistake and asked us to wait and then all they did was tell us thatvit was 21:20 and they cannot let us into the restaurant. They did not care that we actually did come on time and that it was their staff fault that we waited and were not seated. And the way they handled this situation was rude as well. They did not offer to book us a table for tomorrow or offer something as an apology. Nothing. All in all horrible customer service and I won't be coming back.
SKAI Bar,2,"Amazing view. Ask for additional S$23 for windows seat! Food was not as good as expected with a very strange mix of savours (Chef should reconsider his menu).
Service was ok. Burata (starter) and the view were the only positive surprises of the evening."
SKAI Bar,5,Loved it. Awesome Waghu beef stake
SKAI Bar,4,Spectacular views of the Marina Bay and city especially at dusk
SKAI Bar,4,Great place to bring a date
SKAI Bar,5,Great date place with superb food. Night views are the best but high tea has most affordable choice.
SKAI Bar,4,Buffet lunch was awesome albeit a bit less choices compared to other restaurants. View of Singapore at the top is unforgettable experience.
SKAI Bar,2,View is amazing. We used to come when it was equinox. Food is overly priced and service not that great. My food was warm tending to cold for a 125 SGD Japanese stake.
SKAI Bar,5,Quiet and is the best place to sit and chat with your date. Beautiful sunset from the city skyline.
SKAI Bar,5,Fantastic food and ambiance
SKAI Bar,4,Excellent views
SKAI Bar,5,Excellent taste and good service
SKAI Bar,4,Great views but try to go when not raining so the windows aren't stained.
SKAI Bar,5,Enjoy the bay view of Singapore. Food is ok. Good service
SKAI Bar,4,Food is ok but made up with their excellent customer service and the stunning city view. Had a great time and overall satisfied dining experience with my gf.
SKAI Bar,4,"On the 70th floor at the TOP of the SwissHotel at City Hall, this restaurant has spectacular views. The minimalist design in comfortable and doesn’t detract from the vistas outside.
Pros:
1) Food is good - recommend the steak sharing platter for 2, which the Chef carved at the table.
2) Aforementioned views
3) Attached bar with snacks available for those not wanting a full meal
4) Attentive service staff
5) Good wine selection

Cons:
1) Pretty expensive - 3 people with a bottle of wine with mains and sharing 2 starters was $480SGD
2) At almost Michelin Star prices, you would expect more
3) Weird presets - for window table, minimum $150SGD per pax; for normal table, minimum order a main course per pax"
SKAI Bar,4,Ok food. View is gorgeous though
SKAI Bar,5,I love coming here! Great view great food excellent service! Stand to enjoy great discount off the total bill if you are a FAR card member or Amex Platinum cardholder. My only qualms i had was once the cool LED litted menu suddenly lost power. I was sian max.
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing view, good ambience"
SKAI Bar,5,Great service
SKAI Bar,5,"Always a special occassion. The lunch menu is a semi buffet with a good sized buffet (good selection of seafood) and a main which is selected from the menu. The service staff are prompt and engaging. Of course, a selling feature of a restaurant on the 70th floor is the view. On a clear day, look to the south for Batam (Indonesia)."
SKAI Bar,5,"Extremely peaceful and soothing ambience, great place to unwind over majestic views of the city"
SKAI Bar,5,Decent food with nice interior design ~
SKAI Bar,5,Beautiful Singapore view at 50th floor
SKAI Bar,5,"Fresh seafood, excellent service and fantastic view!"
SKAI Bar,4,Awesome view at the restaurant. Can get a window facing table at 25$ extra. Food was not very memorable.
SKAI Bar,5,"Hi just wanted to say that i had dinner at equinox restaurant last night. the service was of a very high standard and the staff went that extra mile to ensure our dining experience was special.
particularly wish to mention Mahen the restaurant manager who was so helpful in ensuring our sleeping infant had a place to rest.
definitely will be back.
with best regards

Sunil and Maricel"
SKAI Bar,5,The food was Ok. The view make up for the rest
SKAI Bar,2,"The view is great, the service is good but disappointing food although it is super pricy. We had to send back the tartare of Saint-Jacques (Clams) because it smelled seafood very strongly, the texture was jelly and not nice in the mouth and the taste was flat although with my mother and I are big fans of Saint-Jacques, what a shame! They replaced the Saint-Jacques with a good seared foie gras though. Then, we had the black cod, it was tender inside and the sides were good but the outside of the fish was a bit rough. Last time, I had the same and it was melting in the mouth, too bad it did not have the effect this time. The Chef did not even show up to collect feedback from us. They offered the coffee though to make up for it but when you spend 600$ for 4 people, you leave with a bad taste in the mouth..."
SKAI Bar,5,"Great food, good service and great view"
SKAI Bar,4,"Can enjoy a spectacular view of Singapore.
Visitors from Korea may benefit from the Korean staff at the reception on 70th floor.
Didn't find the afternoon tea quite impressive.
Can get a 20% discount if you stay in the Swissotel the Stamford, but still quite overpricy."
SKAI Bar,3,"Overpriced drinks and the view was nothing compared to the view at Skai Restaurant or Bar Lounge. Service is up to standard but for 2 drinks, we paid close to $70. I would spend that amount elsewhere."
SKAI Bar,5,"Went for the semi buffet lunch, and it was totally worth the price. Great food and great service"
SKAI Bar,5,Unique food and service
SKAI Bar,4,Exquisite ambience and dining with unbeatable views of the Lion City. Perfect for a romantic evening.
SKAI Bar,5,The awesome view. Good service. Good ambience.
SKAI Bar,5,The Easter buffet was amazing.
SKAI Bar,4,"Good view & delicious afternoon tea, especially herbal tea."
SKAI Bar,4,"Dining with breathtaking view of the CBD area of Singapore.

Do note that choosing tables near the window may incur additional charges"
SKAI Bar,5,"Delicious food, accompanied by excellent service and spectacular view."
SKAI Bar,5,"Amazing views, food, service and dessert!!!"
SKAI Bar,3,"Decent good, good view but overpriced"
SKAI Bar,5,Very classic with amazing views of the city! Must try.
SKAI Bar,5,"Phenomenal!
Great service, excellent food and a stunning view!"
SKAI Bar,2,"Below Par Semi Buffet
i went with my sis for the semi buffet lunch on 15.7.2016. ^^amex is varying the feed @ raffles discounts so will be 35% instead of 50% discount come 1.8.2016. so i thought i come with my sis 1 last time before the change in discount kicks in.many people thinking that as well?
well after 4 yrs absence from this place, it’s like 面目全非. buffet spread halved??the other side which used to host the cooked small plate dishes & cheese board are now tables & chairs.there’s the usual sushi.ok average stuff. i didn’t take much before not taking much now, just the unagi & one maki.same sashimi. i just take the belly.oysters were quite nice, fresh & sweet.my sis loved the crabs. i took a few. she took many more!they had the caviar & tobiko. din have these before.i piled some caviar on the unagi.& some tobiko on the maki.the cold crab not too bad la…some how the mains also did not feel as good as before. psychological?barramundi was ok i supposed, but i though it was a lot better previously…belly pork & pumpkin mash passable also.not particularly impressive taste wise. texture ok did not impress either.there were some fruits. run of the mill & not sweet, so just took watermelon.:-)tried some cakes.also the soft-serve ice cream, pretty good, not too sweet.cakes also not too sweet. quite nice actually.took some apricots, dates. sis took some fig also which i tried.& cappuccino & tea part of the buffet.at 50% discounts lunch was S$29.50pax. not really bad but quite poor c/w before.for this mediocre food, i think even the square & ellenborough market cafe are better so for me no point coming back even at 50% discount so forget about 30% discount from 1.8.2016."

SKAI Bar,5,"(Translated by Google) A restaurant with a very nice view and atmosphere!
Commercial lunch prices are very close to the people, but you can enjoy high-end cuisine and service!
This time I choose 3 course meal, every dish is a surprise
The chopped tune of the appetizer, the tuna is very fresh, and the light seasoning brings out the unique taste of tuna.
Serrano Ham, savory Ham, paired with very sweet cantaloupe, the salty and sweet taste is very special, but I don’t like it
The main dish is salmon, the bottom side dish has a hint of truffle aroma, deep to my heart, the salmon is grilled just right, the outer skin is crispy and the inside is moist, delicious
The dessert is chocolate tart, very rich chocolate taste, slightly bitter, with ice cream, an adult-like dessert
Caramelised banana, amazing me! ! The chocolate puffs on the top are very delicious, with the mashed banana on the bottom, very match, not greasy at all, very easy to eat dessert

Serrano Ham，鹹香的Ham，搭配很甜的哈密瓜，鹹鹹甜甜的口味很特別，但我不喜歡
主菜是salmon，底層的配菜有淡淡松露的香氣，深度我心，鮭魚煎烤的恰到好處，外皮焦脆裡面濕潤，很好吃
甜點是chocolate tart，非常濃郁的巧克力味道，微苦，搭配上冰淇淋，一個大人口味的甜點
Caramelised banana，讓我驚豔！！上面的巧克力泡芙非常好吃，加上底層的香蕉泥，非常match，完全不膩，非常輕鬆可以吃完的甜點"

Service is relatively good and quite polite. The prices on the list are not final as at the end You pay a 10% for service fee and another 7% for VAT. It has good prices for the quality it gives.

Marina Bay Sands is an invisible angle, but you can see city views such as Clark Key and Orchard.

SKAI Bar,4,"(Translated by Google) As others have commented, the view is unmistakably wonderful, and you can make reservations without a hostel. Reservations can also be made at the Swissotel The Stamford 1st floor concierge. On weekdays, there seems to be no problem in reserving the same day. It is said that the window seat should be ordered for more than 150 US dollars. But it was not as busy as the weekend, so I could just move on to the bartender.
Service was very satisfactory and food was okay. I think it is much better to come here than to go to a modest restaurant in Singapore.

서비스가 참 만족스러웠고, 음식도 괜찮았다. 싱가폴에서 어중간한 레스토랑 가는 것보다 여기 오는게 훨씬 낫다고 생각한다."

The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,Overprice ticket and over rated. Small area for animal in tanks and small confinement that all. Go zoo better.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Indeed an interesting museum with a vast array of species, never thought I'll see Alligator Snapping Turtles in Singapore. Vegs and pellets are sold at the counter if you want to feed the tortoises. Tickets are sold at a discounted rate if you hold a pink IC (kindly keep in mind that they are a non-profit afterall and depend on public funding to continue their conversion work (: ) There's a carpark right outside the entrance of the museum."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Fun little place to pass a nice time while at Orto. You can feed the animals, and there are quite a bit of different turtles and tortoises. Would be great for kiddos."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Really cool and awesome for a day out with the kids. They enjoyed themselves so much, feeding the tortoise and turtles. $2 for a bunch of veg for feeding."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"There are many turtle or tortoise for you to interact with as a private museum. Got a few active tortoise walking around, but refuse to eat the vegetables we bought from the reception. The tortoise eat the grass on the ground instead, quite disappointed and wasted $2 to buy the vegetables. However, the turtle in the pond love the food. And much more fun and also a lot more that the tortoise. I recommend to buy the turtle food instead of vegetables.
Beware of the mud during rainy season, as you have to step on the mud to reach to the tortoise.
Overall experience is good, and also interesting to see a lot of turtle merchandise collection there."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"What an interesting place! If you love turtles and tortoises you might want to make a trip down. You will be given some vegetables to feed them, right from the entrance of the farm. While they might be too full if you reach in the afternoon, they will probably be hungrier in the morning. Be careful of your fingers! There are some other turtles in tanks, which are also part of the museum. Overall an educational trip that is experiential as well."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Was able to get really close and hands on with observing and feeling some tortoises and terrapin. There were enough of them crawling around for all the children to engage. Was not too crowded on a weekend early afternoon, although it was very warm. Expect a queue at later timings. Ticket prices were $10 for 7yo and above, $6 for children 3-6yo. Feed was available at $2."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Quite a range of species to look at. Pretty cute if you like turtles and tortoises. Quite the gem.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"This place is really fun for anyone who likes turtles and tortoises. It is fairly small, so it won't take you long to walk around. Feeding the animals is definitely the highlight - they have vegetables and pellets for purchase so you can feed various turtles and tortoises. Our young kids had a great time. There is also a bench swing that's nice and peaceful. Would definitely recommend this place!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,@the live turtle & tortoise museums must visit if you love turtle & tortoise
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Enjoyable. Excellent place to visit with Kiddos
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Wonderful experience for my toddler - feeding and petting the tortoises in a kampung setting is incredibly fun for us.

Plus, Connie was really patient and sweet with us. Definitely will come back again!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Nice place to interact with tortoises and turtles. Sgd2 for lettuce to feed the tortoises. Turtles can roam in selected areas. Many tanks of turtles (abit pitiful though if they have a bigger tank to swim about). At the entrance of orto (you will see the Taoist statues)
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"A good experience for kids to learn about turtles. They can feed the turtles directly. Staffs are friendly and informative. The turtle collection is massive.

However, the place is not too big. There is no ramp for stroller or wheelchair. The reception area is small. When the queue is long, people need to wait outside under the sun.

Price wise, I personally think that it’s ok considering the facilities that they have. Citizen and PR $10/adult, $6/child (3 yrs old and above).
Turtle food is chargeable."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,The previous one is better. very disappointing as the place became small and lesser reptiles.  I don't think the entrance fee of $10 is worth. And the vegetables was $2. Quite expensive caz the portion is small
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,Rude golden hair male staff. Told me rudely it’s up to them to impose the rule they want when clarifying with another staff regarding the safe distancing measures. Totally spoil the whole experience. Would have chose to leave without even entering but didn’t do so as didn’t want to disappoint my 2 boys. Definitely the first and last time visiting. Hope the living conditions of the tortoise and turtles will not be affected the decrease of revenue due to rude staffs
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"This is a great place to bring young children for education on how to appreciate tortoises and turtles.

You can clearly see that this place is being run on tight budget. It is heartening that they are getting support from visitors of all walks of life.

Kids love feeding the reptiles; be it greens or pellets.

Remember to follow the rules during your visit here"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Good place to spend an hour. Cabbage leaves and long beans available for $2 each for feeding. Enjoyable activity for kids. Easy redemption of tickets using klook. Friendly and helpful staff. If you are taking public transport the nearest bus stop is   probably 10 mins walk  away.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,"This place isn't a proper museum of any sort. It's just a holding area for various species of tortoises and turtles. The exotic ones are held individually in fish tanks.

With only 2 employees, there's hardly any monitoring of visitors ill-treating the smaller/safer terrapins that are in the open feeding ponds.

Witnessed some boys pushing the terrapins back into the pond repeatedly despite them trying to get out.

Was an unpleasant experience."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Such a great experience with the long life friends! place is small but well maintained overall. There are many staff around to ensure the shelled residents are safe and comfortable in their home, receiving guests through the day. Its very eco friendly and thus washing hands after the visit was slightly more challenging, with a given pail of used water. Hope that can be enhanced a little with proper sink or facility. Hand sanitisers to accompany, after the hand washing will be even more ideal. Regardless my daughter, mom and myself had a fulfilling experience for a Sunday afternoon!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Beautiful specimens. Kids get the opportunity to feed the turtles.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"It is not big but it has many types of turtles and tortoises, even the carnivore ones.

There is a small cute garden inside where they let some turtles to be free. When I was there few years ago, I could even see the oldest turtle of more than 80 years.

Many people threw coins inside with hope to bring luck to their wishes."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,It was interesting but quite a lot of similar species on display. The owner was super friendly and smiley!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"The place is a little small, but what else can you expect in Singapore? Still, if you are a tortoise, there is quite a fair bit of room to roam around and eat vegetables offered to you by nearly all the visitors there (I think at the price of $2). It is a unique attraction, and they do have a wide variety of tortoises and turtles to look at and take photos of.

Before you go in, you are cautioned about not sacrificing your fingers to the tortoises. Apart from that you are left to your own devices to roam around and look at Master Oogways. Good experience for me"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"If you want to see tortoises and turtles, this is it. A simple no-frills experience where you can walk around to see and feed the tortoises and turtles. It's open air, nothing fancy. You can buy a bunch of veggies to feed them at $2. The entry fee for adults is $10. There is a little room beside the reception housing many tortoise and turtle figurines and artefacts, but the highlight was being able to feed the turtles that were swimming in the pond and roaming freely about upclose."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,"Whilst we enjoyed feeding the tortoises around the museum. We were concerned about the welfare of the animals.

The turtles were kept in fish tanks that were far too small for them. Most were scratching at the corners of the tank as they were too big to turn around. The large turtles were kept in larger enclosures however there was very little stimulation and most were facing the corners which is a sign of distress. Understand that these animals were rescued and are likely in a better home than before but hope more can be done for their welfare.

It was painful too watch so we did not stay long."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Nice place for kids. All about turtle and tortoise.

The entrance to the site is facing the pond."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Pretty good place but small and in need of funding and an upgrade to facilities.    The animals were crammed in small enclosures or tanks in some cases which was not good. The ppl running it have their heart in the right place ...it is an educational place and it was fun feeding the animals ...good but it could be great
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,The place is rather small but they do have a few different turtle and tortoise. Visitor can buy vegetable of feeds to feed the tortoise and turtle
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Great for little kids!! Can be quite hot in the afternoon! Buy the lettuce & pellet feed. You won't regret the experience!!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"I think it’s a great place for kids. Lots of different turtles in different sizes,roaming freely. You can actually touch them and have a close interaction.Even though the place is small you can easily spend 45min to an hour in there. The kids loved feeding the turtles. The lady at the counter was very friendly.
If your children tend to cry or scream then this is not the place to bring them as the turtles get disturbed with loud noises and you may have to leave.
I highly recommend this place for kids or adults who love turtles. It’s absolutely worth the cost.
FYI we took a cab there and back, so no issue with accessibility"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Come here and take things slowly. Lovely place to see and touch some turtles.
Too bad the snapping turtles were chilling in 1 corner. Unable to get a photo of them."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,My baby had a good time feeding the turtles. Very interesting experience.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"Unfriendly and rude staff. Especially towards mother’s with small children. Made the visit totally unpleasant. Also, why is this called a “museum”?!?
Only fun part feeding of turtles for the kids.
Overall not worth the time and and money!!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Amazing experience.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A surprise find. Huge turtles roaming freely in the grounds. Food for turtles can be purchased in pellet or vegetable form. $2 for either. Pellets for turtles in the pond, vegetables for turtles on land. Turtle feeding took place the moment you enter the compound as the turtles walk up to you! Slightly scary but great fun to be up close to them. We got to gently touch their shells, see them get a bath, feed them. Dear daughter's finger got bitten but there was clean water and plaster on hand. The turtles mouth moves fast! Watch for when the vegetable gets closer to their mouths and release the vegetable before your finger gets bitten! Then we threw the pellets into the ponds to feed the smaller turtles. It was really cute to see the turtles stacked up adjacent to the pond. A fun way to spend an hour or two in the afternoon. We'll be back"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,I guess it's better than not having a turtle place altogether
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Great place to spend the afternoon with the kids.  Probably best experience for kids to feed those turtles & tortoises freely roaming the area! Love the idea to set free those turtles & tortoises, let the kids feel closer to the nature."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Pretty fascinating to see so many different species of tortoise and turtles. But not well supervised. Once you enter, people pretty much do anything they want to do. Some people were feeding where it says “no feeding”. Touch them and press them however they wanted. Feel bad for the turtles.

Entrance is only reasonable for Singapore citizens and PR. We had to pay “Foreigner fee” because we are EP/DP. The food items for feeding are separate charge. Of course the kids wants to feed the turtles endlessly!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Great for a casual outdoor family outing with children as they are able to come up close with various tortoises and turtles. You could even contribute to the upkeep of the place by purchasing a bundle of long beans at S$2 to feed the residents as they stroll around freely within the confined open spaces. Used to be at Chinese Garden in the western side of Singapore but had recently moved to its present site. Stock up on drinks as it could get abit sweaty here. :)

Entrance fees
Adults : S$10
Children: S$6
(all fees collected goes towards the maintenance of the place as it is privately run)"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Good value for money attraction. For $5 I got to meet with a lot of different turtles and tortoises. The gazillion terrapins roaming around the lawn were extremely friendly. Workers treat the animals especially well. All the animals are very clean, very well fed and most of them are taken them out of their enclosures for a short period to exercise and explore the lawn."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,The staff was very nice and explain to us in very detailed about what we can and cannot do. The place was not that big but to my surprise we spend good 45mins inside. My boy really love this place. Definitely will come back again.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"The Turtle & Tortoise Museum is really well worth place to visit. It's in the middle of the beautiful Chinese gardens, which has a free entry and gives a little taste of Chinese architecture, scenery and culture. The Turtle museum it self has a 5 dollar entrance fee. It looks a bit chabby, but the content is really cool. I had no idea that there was so many completely different awesome, but weird looking types of turtles. Saw many creatures I've never seen before. Really cool"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Many turtles have deformed shells from lack of UVB or a bad diet in the past (or improper care from previous owners), but it seems like the current staff is aware of the animals needs. They try to keep the turtles healthy by giving each turtle some time out in the sun every now and then (I think they said once a week but don't quote me on this). This provides some needed UVB.

Sadly I still feel like there just isn't enough space for the amount of turtles they have. The small ones in the pond have a great environment but the others just have to sit in tiny empty boxes or aquariums without any environmental enrichment and wait for their turn to get their weekly hour outside. Because of this I just can't bring myself to give more than three stars.

I would be happier if they had less turtles but provided bigger enclosures and better environments for each one."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"came here on a weekend afternoon, place is not that crowded but there are still a number of families. tortoises get to free roam, and you get to feed both tortoises and turtles! worth a visit, and your entrance fees + any drinks + tortoise food all go towards helping the tortoises and turtles 😊 the staff was v friendly!!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Good place for kids if all ages to see and feed tortoises up close. There are 7 giant tortoises that roam freely in an enclosed pen and probably hundreds of terrapins and striped tortoises in 2 ponds. There are several rarer species are kept in separate enclosures and tanks too.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Good effort on owner trying to adopt/rear these turtle and tortoises. However, premises require more maintainence and there are too many visitors (kids disturbing poor tortoise)."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Went there after hiking the Tree top Trail.
It's kinda far from the center, so I'd recommend doing something else while in the area. Saw a large variety of different unique and adorable turtles 🐢🐢"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"It is a wonderful place for preschooler-age kids. It is mainly feeding of tortoise and turtle. the feed is $2 (vege for land tortoise) and $2 for the terrapins' food pallete. There is also an entry fee individual, and you can spend around 30 mins to an hour in that place."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"An amazing museum located in Chinese Gardens. Tickets cost $5 for adults and $3 for kids younger than 7 years old. At the counter you can purchase turtle feed. Loads of terrapins in the lake. One or two might even escape the lake and crawl on the garden. Feeding the turtles was extremely relaxing and kinda therapeutic. The kids loved feeding the terrapins. The museum even has several large turtles, a couple were more than 100 years old. Will definitely return."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,I like watching the tortoise and turtle 🐢. Bought food for them. The most fascinating is the aligator snapping turtle.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Very small. However, there's a lot of turtles to look at. They look pitiful though.

Would still definitely recommend if you love turtles like me. The entrance fee is really cheap. You can feed them too."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"it’s only $5 (dollar Singapore) you will experience feeding the turtles, and really close to the turtle and turtoise. If you like the animal or need some kind of observation there are a lot of kind of turtle and turtoise here.

Thank you for taking care the turtles and turtoise. It’s was my lucky day to see the turtles laying eggs. The volunteers is so friendly to tell about the story and the background of the turtles."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,Filthy. Not equipped for guests at all. The staff are completely irresponsible. My friend in a wheelchair got badly bitten by the old tortoise i don't blame the creature but the staff and their laziness . Their wound solution was in an opened vial. They had no responsibility at all. The tanks are dirty and the smell is awful.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Wonderful place. Very nice to see the turtles and tortoises roaming about :)
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Small area where they house a variety of turtles. Kids may love this place as you can go up close and feed them. They have a wide variety of turtles that you can see and touch.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,loved this place. lots of live turtles.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Great place to enjoy with kids. Tortoise and turtles are roaming here and there. We bought cabbage and green veggies for them from the reception and feed them. Great activity for kids. Kids will enjoy the trip. Can spend couple of hours.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,This place holds the most types of turtles and tortoises in the Guinness world of records. You get to see some of the rareless turtles in the world and visitors get to pick a Tortoise for a Tortoise race and even get to feed the Tortoises up close and personal!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Was hesitant to pay $10 per entry but worth it! No regrets adding $2 for bunch of leafy veggies to feed the turtles. Many giant turtles roaming freely 🐢 & awesome to see them up close 👀
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Absolutely fun to get close with these gentle giants.
Pro tip: Please don't yell at your kids or lift the turtles."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"I just went there today. Here are some things you need to take note • entrance fee is $5 for per person 6/7 - 64 and $3 for those not in that age range • $2 is for a bunch of long beans(about 20) and $1 for a packet of pellets. (I suggest you buy the long beans as you can hold the beans while you feed the turtles/tortoises) • you cannot feed some of them so check the signs • you are not allowed to hold any of them.              I rated 4 stars because I really enjoyed my experience there. However, I am no animal expert so I will leave some photos.  The place is not so big. It's about the area of an executive flat(except it's rectangular)"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"One last visit before they are moving to a new place. Do take note on the entry fee. I will say it's always worth the penny, to let the kids have the experience."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"I'd in my to visit this place during my Singapore trip, well it didn't disappoint. Entry was reasonable, you've the option to purchase a turtle feed which I recommend you do, I like this place as you can get really close touching the turtles. There are a variety of turtles who look well fed, the staff was also very polite when I asked for directions and information, do recommend."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Small place but nice to be able to feed the turtles. Can see they are really loved.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Oh boy the turtles have lotsa vegetables to eat. Everyone buys the food and well, let's just say there is a lot of balance.
Kids will enjoy feeding the turtles but exercise caution when feeding as they bite.
There isn't much information on the turtles itself so do take note.
The turtles are not afraid of people at all and there is a fair bit of variety."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"I truly like this place.There are free roaming tortoises and turtles as well as some rarer (pigged nose turtle, snake neck turtle, Asian soft shell turtle etc.) Some review here said turtle in captive is sad. From what I see and read, they are quite rare species so I suspect they might be left after grow too big for the exotic pet lovers who imported them and ended up at this place for 🐢. Some of them are rescue from restaurant in Malaysia and some of turtles are lucky enough to be under a patronage (so normal Singaporean who possibly deposit money for their extra) Also some of them possibly required knowledge to be taken care off better. So do come and just help with your entrance fee of 5 SGD. I don't think it will break your pocket. You will love feeding the big roaming flock in the centre pond. There are 2 that so cute they follow you around and able to eat food from your hand just be gentle and don't scare the little one."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Kids are excited to feed the tortoise. Beware of the tortoise bite.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Kids love it. Very small place. Book tickets on site to help their cause.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"This review is to honor the museum. I heard it's gonna move out. I've been in this place twice in my life. The first time I visited the museum was in 2015 with my sister. We saw hundreds of turtles, tortoises, including little statues and item collections of the animals.

The entrance fee to the museum is still at SGD5. You can also feed the turtles at SGD1. Just don't pick them up! I saw a kid trying to pick the turtle and the creature almost snapped his fingers. Well, you can see the red-eared turtle and those humongous snapping ones.

In 2017, I just strolled along the gardens, eating ice cream sandwiches and sitting down on the grass. I came back to the museum just retracing my steps from two years earlier.

If the museum is still there this September 2018, I'm definitely going back."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,awesome
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"The place may not be big but it has many turtle and the best thing is there are turtles roaming around freely and you are able to see and touch them. The entry is $10 for pink/blue nric adult,  highly recommend getting a bunch of veg for $2, the experience of feeding them is 👍🏻👍🏻"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Very much worth the $5 entry fee! So many different turtles and tortoises. Super cute!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"It was OK, not as used to be in Chinese garden, enterence fee is higher for this small place where you can only spend little time. One good thing is kids can have close contact with some of the tortoises."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,The kids really enjoyed feeding the turtles/tortoises here. But it is VERY run down (-1 star for that). I hope the entrance fee really is going towards renovating the facility.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Beautiful  place to relax and rest your mind with natural  views
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A place with many tortoises and turtles. Good for family activity. A little rundown.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,Rather expensive with touch of captivity.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Just a bunch of turtles. Didnt think it was worth the entrance fee. For almost the same price you can do long kang fishing or prawning at the same venue at ORTO.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Interesting place to see. Lots of different species of turtles. Great trip for the young ones.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A small place with free turtles n tortoise.. can feed free roaming tortoise.. good place for toddlers n kids..
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Lots of different species of turtle and tortoise, would be nicer if they have better signage and descriptions for each."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Small..but worth visiting with kids..my littleone loved it
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,One has to learn how to preserve the places. Everything you need is there. Salute to Singaporean
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Great place for children to interact & learn about these gentle creatures. However part of the garden is no longer open to visitors. Signages of each turtle & tortoise in the tanks & pens can be improved or at least better maintained.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Beautiful views and great architecture. You can enjoy watching live and colorful fish.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Not such a big place but they are flexible with how we play with the animals not so stringent. Quite hard to get in so best to drive. No atm so either cash or paynow. Wld be best if cheaper but still an Afternoon well spent
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Lovely set-up with a wide variety of tortoises and turtles. The pond area was filled with the red-ear sliders that we have at home as well - kids were thrilled to see a big pond-full of them and the free-to-roam-around ones within the gated areas.
The only con was the long queue (probably during school holidays) as the uncle at the entrance had to handle all ticketing duties by himself."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Was a bit disappointing. The space is quite small, was expecting to see bigger turtles and tortoises. The pricing system is strange and we were charged full price even though we are residing in Singapore."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Went with my boys for the first time today and they enjoyed their time there feeding the tortoises and terrapins. Nice staff there who were all very kind and friendly.

Entrance fees ($10 adults / $6 for seniors and children above 3) and $2 for each portion of food for purchase, can be paid either by Cash or Paynow.

Managed to speak to the lady boss of the place and I understand that the government has extended the lease for 1.5 years for this place; so she’s like left hanging - unsure if a relocation is possible or if a closure is imminent. She’s a lovely lady, kind and I understand her concerns.

Hopefully help from all sorts - volunteers, funds and government support would come her way soon! All the best! Thumbs up!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,I didn't enjoy seeing these animals in such small (and sometimes dirty) cages and aquaria... also it was pretty expensive for such a small area
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,They have moved to Orto (Khatib MRT)
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Lot of turtles to get to know, nice place to visit.."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"$5 entry per person to see the largest collection of turtles in the world. It's worth a look in, especially during feeding time (afternoons)."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Interesting place for a visit for an hour or so. This was our second visit as we live nearby. Lots of fun feeding the turtles. It's a shame that it looks like this place will disappear with the modernization of Chinese Garden, which is already nice as it is!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Very small. I had expected more from this museum. So disappointing.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Location is small but it does have quite a good number of live specimens to view and get close to unlike the other places where you can view them from afar without paying the heavy price of getting private tours and stuffs.

The gentleman at the counter was really nice and polite adding a plus point for anyone who visits! We accidently dropped our feeds since the kids are a bit eager to see the turtles and he just gave us as a form of service recovery, something which is hard to come by now ondays from someone. (Couldn't catch his name but wears a dream catcher earring)

Overall the staff and environment is perfect.

10/10 would recommend."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Located inside the Chinese Garden is this museum. With an entrance of $5 you'll get to see a swarm of roaming live turtles and other species in their own aquariums.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"I first went to this place when it was at Chinese Garden. It was the day my daughter turned 2, her favourite animal at that time was the turtle!!! So off we went. We sure had an amazing time! My daughter was sooo happy feeding the tortoise & turtles and did not want to leave the place! It was such a memorable adventure indeed. Today, I went there again, but they have already moved to lor Chencharu, and this time, my daughter is already 4. She was so excited when she found out that we are going here again. Her excitement makes her younger brother, who also just turned 2 to also be excited. Although at first he was shocked to see a huge tortoise as big as him roaming around freely, he quickly enjoyed the feeding session and had a great time also. This place deserves a good short trip for everyone to discover the cuteness of these reptiles. 💖"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Come and support this place! Free roaming tortoises to feed. Remind your kids to feed carefully as the tortoises might mistake their little fingers as vegs.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,It’s not a very big place I was expecting and the number of species is quite limited especially for the price. But you get to buy some cabbage and pellets to feed them. You could also touch and pat them.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Suitable for family outing and kid friendly place. You can experience the fun of feeding tortoises and turtles, and it's a great opportunity to let children get close to animals."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,I hope that most of these turtles were rescued and not bought to be displayed. Several of them were in sad little tanks or concrete enclosures. It's $5 per entry with discounts for senior citizens and small children. You can buy a small pack of pellets for a dollar to feed the turtles in the pond and $2 gets you a handful of Long beans for the bigger turtles
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"It's worth to pay a visit, which can see various type of turtle and tortoises"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,rare species right here i found my great great great great grandturtle here
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Lovely place to get hands on with the tortises. Small but fun. We had great fun petting some of the larger languid tortises.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,It was a WOW experience for our family. Didnt expect to be so close up with the tortorise and they were roaming around freely for some. My son loves it and will be back again. The nearest carpark is along Yuan Ching Rd (temporary carpark) as there are construction works on-going at Chinese Garden rd.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Interesting little place; more owner's personal display rather than museum. Nice to see those tortoises & turtles out & roaming, but many of the cabinets are pretty small & the animals look quite fed up."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Though the turtle race was cancelled due to lack of kids participating. We had fun feeding the turtles & tortoises.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A great place to visit with young children to learn about turtles. The place is small-ish but it is good enough for a 1 - 1.5 hour of visit. Would be great though if hand sanitizer and/or soap is provided for visitors to clean their hands afterwards.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Fantastic experience! So many great turtles of all sizes. Some very rare and some very fun to feed and interact with!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"The place is small, but still worth a visit! They have many different turtle and tortoise. $5 for adult , $3 for child."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Had the privilege of going before it shifted from chinese gardens so in comparison it is much smaller however the experience with interacting with turtles isn't compromised. They need your support to make the place even better!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Great experience. My children enjoyed feeding and touching the tortoise and turtles. Keep it up.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Nice place to visit for kids
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Very good learning experience for young children. Will definitely go again.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"Visited on 30 Nov, the first impression was bad smell like rotten egg. Visitors are mostly children with parents. Is it a safe and hygiene place for children?"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A lot of turtles and tortoises to spend time with. We can also feed them.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Interesting place with good collection of vulnerable tortoises and turtles. There's several areas where they roam around while visitors feed them with pellets or vegetables.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Likes:
- Great petting zoo. My 2 year old son go to go up close to the tortoises and feed them.
- There was a good selection of different species to look at.

Areas for improvement:
- Long Q to enter. There was no shelter, no chairs for people to sit. People were lined up all along the carpark road. Not safe seeing that this place caters mainly for families with young kids.
- There should be more hand sanitisation points or hand washing points.
- The turtle enclosures were smelly and were visibly breeding mosquitoes. I could see the larvae. This has to be improved
- There was a lot of broken wood planks and debri that is just piled up on one corner of the Museum. This should be cleared out. Not sure why they kept it there.
- Some of the turtles are large and barely have space to turn in the tanks they are kept in. Some are even kept in small plastic tubs. This is not an ideal environment for these animals. I feel this place should reduce the number of animals they keep so they can give them a better environment."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Very nice place. You can feed the turtles and tortoises.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Fun for kids to feed the turtles. The turtles can really eat non stop. So everyone got a chance to feed it
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"Small place, not worth 14 SGD for foreigners to pay per person with some tortoise to feed inside. It would have been okay for 3-5 SGD per person for considering the maintenance for the animals.

for Tourists - You should top up a little more and enjoy the zoo/river safari/sea aquarium etc.
Do note you don't also get any ticket , receipt for the money you give which is strange in Singapore as every place gives you ticket or receipt for the money you pay for.

10 SGD for LOCAL/PR"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A lot of friendly turtles and tortoises. Info plagues are very informative. The feeding part is certainly fun (and the tortoises certainly know the drill). The lady (very knowledgeable on turtle matters) at the park has been very helpful and shared with us about the upkeep of the animals, hatching process, etc. We will definitely make another visit next time we are in town!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,It's a nice place to spend a couple of hours. Specially good for kids. Very friendly staff.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Good variety of tortoises and turtles. Opportunity to hand feed tortoises
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Up close with tortoises, but limited things to see and do. The salmonella warning at the end could have been provided at the start, and soap provided."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"many different turtles there. even though you have to pay a small entrance fee (per person), the knowledge you can gain inside the museum is more precious. you can pet some of the bigger turtles which roam around freely and feed them. there are also many different species of turtles, some of them exotic and rare."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Kids had a fun time feeding the tortoise.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Great place to take kids...feeding the Tortoises is the highlight of the trip as kids get to do it easily!!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,not much to see for a $10 dollars entry fees. the animals are fully fed and lazy to move around with tons of visitors. there should be more sitting areas inside the farm and also some live guides and shows to keep the visitors amazed. the farm is a bit run down
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Very comfortable place to let your kids to be around!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Great place to get up close with the turtles and tortoises. It is quite a small place but well-maintained. Please buy some veg to feed them so that this place is sustainable and the future generation can have another place to see and love animals. Will be back!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A small place that you can see all of the different species of turtle around the world. Hope to have a bigger space.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Great place to Lear about turtles
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Friendly staff and turtles. You can feed the turtles for a small price. There is also turtle races. Family-friendly experience which will heighten knowledge about turtles. There are many unique species of turtles which are sure to wow the younger ones.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Love it and fun family outing...
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Being going to this museum since they were at Chinese Garden. That location seems more spacious than their current location.
I heard from them that they may have to move again from Orto. Not sure if it is true.
I have to say, they are really lack of funding. It is a good place for family and children too . Please make sure adults are with the children at all times because there are ponds around and many fragile items there."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Kids 3 years and above $6
Adult $10
Very small place.
If u go with a big family its not worth to pay"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Dropped by for a short visit today and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, learning about the different turtles and tortoises. They were so friendly, will definitely come back!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Educational but enterance fee too expensive.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"A must go spot for turtle lover like me 💋

Turtle walks around freely and eat the grass freely! So happy to have a view like this!

I read news that this place is organized by a father and daughter who love turtle so much. Thank you for being so many lovely turtle to share with us.

A reasonable entrance fee is required. Good for family to bring their children to come and teach them about turtle and to treasure them.

I remembered that there is a big turtle in black who loved to being touched 😘

One stars is being deducted is the water for the fish is very dirty..."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Good
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Staff were knowledgeable and helpful with questions and friendly. Turtles and tortoises were so cute :))) Do support them by visiting and donating
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Past time with kids
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,not much to do and pricey
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"There are not much turtle and tortoise variety with almost one third of the tanks are flying pig-nosed turtle, which is less than expected.

10 dollars per entry is a little expensive for this, but I'm willing to support their cause of raising these cute bois."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Serene and calm place to spend your weekend with little ones. We will definitely visit again and again.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,The terrapins are not really hungry unlike the Tortises. The tortoises piss like a river so beware
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Good for kids with nature delights.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"It's an odd place to visit.  You get to see so many varieties of turtles and tortoises.  They all look relatively healthy.

The downside to this is that they do look mistreated.  I know from interactions from the staff that they are looked after, fed well and reproduce but it doesn't look like that.  The tanks look small, some are very low in water.

The explanation that they're used to it doesn't fly. Avoid

It's hard to put your finger on why it comes across like this, but you don't come away thinking that the animals are being treated well."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Good place to feed tortoises.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Superb place. Highly highly recommended for kids.. pls support this business, and buy the food to feed the turtles.. every small amount goes into keeping this place in business!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,You can feed live turtles!!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Interesting place to visit for both adults and children. Visitors can feed the turtles (a lot of them) and the animals are well taken care of. Due to the upcoming construction project - this museum might have to relocate to somewhere else in the near future!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,New location at Lorong Chencharu is smaller than the Chinese Garden location. But I’m glad this museum is still around. Tickets at $10 per adult is pricy but it’s worth it to help out the museum and the animals. My wife and kid had fun there. It’s a good place for a family outing. Buy some beans to feed the tortoise. It’s fun. Do bring umbrella for the sun because half the area is outdoors.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Scenic and rustic ambience and nice for family outing. Turtles and Tortoises are beautiful and friendly too 🐢👍🏻🐢👍🏻🐢👍🏻🐢👍🏻🐢👍🏻
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"They move the Museum from the old Chinese Garden in Jurong. Although the place is small, kids & adults can visit here to know more of the various species of fresh water turtle & tortoise existed. Pay a small amount to hand feed the tortoise roaming freely."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Very interesting place to see these small animal had a great place to stay. If not for my friend, wont know there is such a place. Please support the Museum."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"What a cosy and sweet place for the turtles, terrapins and tortoises! We spent a good 2.5h there feeding and getting to know them. The highlight was the friendly staff Wai Yee and Isabelle, who generously shared nuggets of information with us regarding their charges. Thank you!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Very good place to visit with kids. Live feeding and there is a giant tortoise roaming freely. It's education and yet fun for the kiddos
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Awesome to feed the tortoise and see the many species of turtles!  Highly recommend to support these efforts.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Great place, the kids will love it."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Lots of tortoises & turtles of different species. Compound is small and each visit should take between 1 - 3 hours depending on individual. They look well taken care of and well fed by owners and visitors. They are generally docile but do bite in some cases (probably by accident or misunderstanding). Too cute to lay blame on them anyway.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"We went to the Turtle Museum at ORTO on a Saturday morning. It was a really nice family experience. My 2 year old son really enjoyed  feeding and touching the turtles. It’s a quick walk from the MRT, less than 10 minutes mostly shaded."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Small but very interesting place for kids especially in Singapore, kids rarely have the opportunity to get close up with wild animals."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"My son thoroughly enjoyed his visit today, feeding and petting the tortoises. This is our 2nd visit, but today's visit was more enjoyable because we got to speak with one of the staff members. He very kindly encouraged my son to touch the creatures, and even did an impromptu tour.

It is a small place... but.. simple pleasures, yaknow? Definitely worth the entrance fee."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Lots of different kinds of turtles, but their enclosures are very very small. Thankfully there are signs that say all of the turtles are rescues, but just because they were saved doesn't mean they should be kept in such horrible standards. This is Singapore, they have the money to properly house these beautiful animals..."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,We are able to feed free roaming large turtles and be very close to them. An excellent place for kids to experience them.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A beautiful place, with many kinds of turtles. You could see there many kinds of turtles you can feed the turtles and even pat some of them (don't pat the ones that bite). A very good place to visit with kids."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Small but very nice experience for children to interact with turtles and tortoises. Very reasonable entry fee. Hope they relocate and manage to save the museum.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Fun for the kids.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,A good place for kids to interact with turtles and tortoises. This place also is a sanctuary for different types of turtles and tortoises
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"Fun little stop-off place to take visitors to the city when you're going through Chinese Garden.
Mostly just a curiosity, but a nice environment, and definitely worth looking in.
In the middle of Chinese / Japanese garden, so you probably won't visit just this museum by itself - but as part of a visit to the whole garden complex, do stop in!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,A very limited carpark space for a place to visit.👎👎👎👎👎
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"beautiful place. i love it :) especially recommend if you have a burning passion for turtles like I do. Just a question, is this place still open as I heard about some news of it closing down? I'm not so sure as I don't really read the news but I will defenitely come down here again if it is still opened :)"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,It is quite and calm. Discipline is maintained. Government has to arrange e rickshaw to cover all the places. That is only lacking.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"it's the dedication of the people in charge of this exhibit that caught my attention, they made sure you enjoy every bit of the place. they are like proud parents showing off their children."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Great place, amazing collection of tortoises and turtles. 10/10 would turtly visit again"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Having such a dedicated and compassionate curator make my kids enjoyed the trip at museum to the max. It is the great curator that make a big difference to the musuem. Thank you uncle Rainbow.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"It was definitely a eye opening experience for my family and I.

They have 5 places in a second sized area. Not too big, not too small.

The 1st area entrance and the  the gallery of all types of turtle memorabilia and souvenirs you can buy. (There is an entrance fee)

2nd is this ""walk with turtles"" area where you can feed them and take pictures of them. A small backyard sized area there some turtles rain freely.

3rd they have these viewing spaces where they have humongous turtles inside which you can feed as well but be sure to read the safety regulations before feeding.

4th is these glass tanks with different types of turtles. I never knew there were  so my different species of turtles till I went there and saw for myself.

And lastly is the small pond area with terrapins that seem to fill the pond. My kids had a blast throwing food seeds only to see they take their time to reach the beads. Haha.

Overall a nice place. Will definitely go again."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Really cool as some of them are outside with space and you can feed them and kiddle  them, but also a bit sad for the ones in small spaces.... Mitigate feeling for this part. Go there to make your own opinion but we came out feeling quite guilty of having been there"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,"I found the turtle pond and roaming tortoises are a pleasant sight but the concrete ponds and tanks are pretty grim.

Although I am no expert, and the turtles and tortoises don't appear particularly ill (one turtle appeared to have some eye problems though), but they are kept in relatively small bare glass tanks and concrete boxes that are somewhat dirty.

Because of this, the atmosphere given is of a pet shop or a temporary holding shelter, not that of a zoo or a museum. People fond of keeping these animals set up large tanks with gravel, sand, plants, filters etc., but an attraction dedicated to these animals has none of these.

I appreciate the effort gone into rescuing these pets (whose owners may have spared no thought into the effort it takes to maintain these animals), but I would have expected more. I understand there is an effort to relocate and expand, and I have no idea if there are financial issues, but I would have happily paid more if it means financing at least some minor improvements in their welfare. Maybe if none of this is possible, then  visitors should be able to adopt some animals to allow an expansion within the site.

I hope in future an expansion occurs, with efforts taken to improve tank and concrete enclosure conditions."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Well worth a visit through a beautiful park to visit what is truly a labour of love. Especially fun if you're a tourist and want to visit something off the beaten track.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,It was okay. Good for kids. The turtles were all caged though 😿. There was a $10 donation per pax..And turtle food must be purchased from inside for $2 (10pcs of short beans). The front desk girl is very friendly and was helpful.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"It was cute at first, coming in and being greeted by turtles walking around. I didn't feel like buying vegetables to feed, but the kind lady in the front gave me a couple cabbages to give them anyway. But then I actually took a look around, and the conditions the turtles live in are just, sad. Most of them are kept in either empty, dirty pools or they are individually kept in small aquariums.

One of the turtles was described to be ""beautifully marked by the star"" on his shell, but it was infected and there were a bunch of holes on his shell. When I walked out, the turtle that had greeted me in the beginning was dripping a lot blood from its mouth. I walked to the lady in the front desk to tell her, and either she didn't understand what I was trying to tell her, or she didn't really care. I think she said he was fine, but he was dripping in blood, from his mouth, I dont think he was fine....

I would like to give this place a good review, considering the variety of turtles and the kindness of the workers, but what I saw literally scarred me. Given the current living conditions and care given to these turtles, I would definitely not recommend visiting this museum."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Mini-zoo of tortoises and terrapins - good for kids!
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Love to see the cute turtle and Will come back.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A secret garden of tortoises and turtles. Entry fee for kids is $3 while adults is $5. Feed can be bought at $1 a pack. Quite crowded on the weekend as their lease is said to end this month. Unless you enjoy nature and seeing those creatures, you probably won't stay longer than an hour there. Great place to bring kids and let them learn more about these reptiles. Kids especially love feeding the terrapins in the pond"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,You will get to feed them. Wonderful experience for kids.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Interesting museum in Jurong Gardens. Kind of small. Kids seem to like it. You only need to spend about 30 minutes here. Cost of admission is under 5$.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"The museum is so lively, all types of turtle and tortoise are there, you can feed them too."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Good place to know the diversity of turtle and tortoises. We can also have a close look of tortoise from dino age...amazing huh
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"It is a non-profit museum, a good place to visit with friends and family. The staffs are friendly. There are also a lot of variety of turtle and tortoise. Get to see the oldest tortoise of 150 years old. The turtle craft collection is really impressive. From the collection, it can tell that the owner is really a turtle lover."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Saw few rare tortoise and turtle. Eye opening. Under maintained. Maybe because they moving by end of March.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,The water murky need to do clean up
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A cosy and small museum for tortoises and turtles lovers and to learn much more about them.

Some tortoises (some of them are rather huge, gentle giants) are even free to roam around. I hope they can have a bigger place for more tortoises to roam around."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Free range large tortoises!! Kids love it.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"A wonderful place for kids and adults to interact with turtles and tortoises sans any barriers.  As this place focusses on one type of animal, you learn more about them and can be amazed by the variety of turtles and tortoises there are! It is sad that this place is going to be shut soon."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Are we able to feed the tortoises there? If so can we bring breads to feed them? I haven't been there so I am just curious if we able to feed them there. I know the staff there would provide us food to feed the tortoises. Pls answer as I am curious and I am going there later
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"Good experience,  get close to the live creatures,  feeding but place too small,  hope they get a bigger plot to house thrm"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Been here many many years ago. So sad to hear you are moving out. Hope you find a new place. All the best
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Authentic Soups. Homely Service by husband and wife team.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,Fantastic place to let kid get up close and personal with the tortoises. Watch the fingers though when feeding them
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"They show a lot of species. However, that was one of the most depressive places I have visited so far. The enclosures are very small and austere. It s just a sad place to go.
#freetheturtles!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,The place looks really old. Specially compared to the nice surrounding garden. Yet some very nice tortles but their houses look really pity.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"A lot of animals that you can feed by yourself, and really friendly owners! Sadly we can't make it to the feeding of the snapping turtles."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Great for little kids! Lots of fun feeding the turtles, the owners are so friendly and nice"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,I really loved the variety of turtles there with it being a refreshinng taste to the mundane life we have here. It's not very common we see so many diff type of turtles. However the place is abit run down.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"This place should be close for all the bad they do to these turtles. Most of them are keep in tiny cages, they are close in cages with many other turtles without anything in ( water, food, grass...). They just get food from the guest who want to feed them.

The turtles should be keep outside in the beautiful park that's Chinese garden.

No one should support this ""museum""."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"You are going to find tortoise everywhere, and there is a ticket you need to pay for to get in,  I went on Jan 2019 and the ticket price was 5 Singapore dollars"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"Ok, there is an impressive variety of turtles/tortoises for 5$, but the aquariums are very small, sometimes with a very few amount of water. The ground is made of polystyrene and some animals seems to have a soft shell!"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,I personally like this place. And it might seem that the admission is not worth it but it all goes into the sustainability of this place .
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Place is pretty small. Entrance fee a little too steep at $10/pax.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,love the uncle who guided us around. My kids loved this place.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Aesthetically pleasing. Just good for strolling on lazy days and maybe lying back to read on weekends.Very well maintained. Zero facilities are provided.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Nothing much entrance fee quite expensive
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"A homely family oriented museum with a wide range of turtles & tortoises for viewing pleasure & unforgetable interactions.

Reptile enthusiasts will especially enjoy getting up close with the free ranging sulcatas which inhabit the museum. Great for families & especially young ones to learn about these fascinating animals and how friendly they can be.

Hope the museum will be upgraded to provide a more naturalistic habitat for these reptiles(substrate,heat,UVB and calcium/vitamin supplements) for environmental enrichment of the animals.

It was also slightly depressing to see the aquatic turtles & tortoises in small tanks but with the amount of abandoned pets & space constraints, I believe management is doing all they can for these animals. Still do hope the future is bright for this humble sanctuary & would love to visit it at its new home wherever it may be."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,The turtles are cute! They are used to people going there and won't be shy with you. They expect food.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,My favorite place..I find this place very close to my heart.. love spending time with my turtoise friends:)

The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"An interesting museum to check out in the heartlands. Get to see free to roam turtles and rare tortoises. Not a huge place, but can spend around 2 hours to enjoy being surrounded by chelonians."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,Alas they are no longer at The Chinese Garden in Jurong. They have moved more than 20km to Sembawang. Sad. Sad.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Visit the museum before it closes. Hopefully they find a new and suitable home.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,5,"Went to the turtle and tortoise museum on Sunday and it was super crowded.Red eared sliders were awesome,snatching the beans and rushing back into the water with other turtles chasing after it,i have two turtles and one tortoise at home 2.The turtles in the tanks were so cute and the info on the turtles and tortoises were very accurate.My brothers enjoyed it and they loved touching Xiao Hei,the Aldabra tortoise.The sulcata tortoises fdee roaming were really cute and not to mention,my favourite turtle,the pig nosed turtle was there!!Loved this trip and i even bought a souvenir for myself to always cherish this trip and this place."

The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Nice place to see different types of turtles and tortoises.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,Rather overpriced for a under maintenance place of interest.
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,Some extraordinary turtles and tortoises I had never imagined existed. Their conditions seem rather cramped though.

The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"If you are a animal lover , you will like it"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,1,"Really sad experience here, the tortoises and turtles were kept in tiny tanks with no stimulation and often no water. The 'free' roaming ones appeared to be very hungry. An animal welfare nightmare. We left feeling really sad. Please please do something to improve the conditions these poor animals live in, it's no way to keep such beautiful creatures."

The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,4,"(Translated by Google) It's not amazing, but it's a turtle museum. turtle! ?? It ’s a turtle! ?? When I went there, the clerk said, ""Turtle! Turtle!"", So I entered. It's a B-class spot. In the Chinese garden? It's nearby. Please to kill time

(Original)
すごいしょーもないけど亀のミュージアムです。亀！？亀なの！？って行ってたら店員さんが 「カメ！カメ！」って言ってきたので入りました。B級スポットですね。chinese gardenの中？近くにあります。暇つぶしにどうぞ"
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,3,"(Translated by Google) My opinion about this place is very mixed.

I loved the setting, the gardens are beautiful. I enjoyed the walk among the turtles who wander outside and who start to ""run"" after us if we buy some food to distribute to them.

However, I did not really like to see many turtles wading in tiny aquariums or parked in pens without having to do anything. It's nice to want to show a large number of turtle species but I think that the well-being of some of these turtles is not the main concern of the place ...

So yes, you will see turtles, some very impressive but ... is that enough to justify the conditions in which some of them live? Your turn to judge...

The rate for an adult: $ 5. A small bag of food is sold for $ 1.

I went there one weekday morning, no expectations, very few crowds. I was even alone for most of my visit. I didn't bother to visit the museum.

(Original)
Mon avis à propos de ce lieu est très mitigé.

J'ai adoré le cadre, les jardins sont magnifiques. J'ai apprécié la promenade au milieu des tortues qui se balladent en extérieur et qui se mettent à nous ""courir"" après si on achète un peu de nourriture à leur distribuer.

J'ai toutefois fort peu apprécié de voir de nombreuses tortues patauger dans de miniscules aquariums ou parquées dans des enclos sans rien avoir à y faire. C'est sympa de vouloir montrer un nombre important d'espèces de tortues mais je pense que le bien-être de certaines de ces tortues n'est pas la principale préoccupation du lieu...

Alors oui, vous verrez des tortues, certaines très impressionnantes mais... cela suffiti-il à justifier les conditions dans lesquelles certaines d'entre elles vivent ? A vous de juger...

Le tarif pour un adulte : $5. Un petit sachet de nourriture est vendu $1.

J'y suis allé un matin en semaine, aucune attente, très peu d'affluence. J'étais même tout seul durant la plus grande partie de ma visite. Je n'ai pas pris la peine de visiter le musée."
The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,2,"(Translated by Google) Museum in poor condition. Visited on a rainy day it shouldn't help. It is very handcrafted from small hand-made old aquariums in which the turtles survive without the slightest space for swimming ...
A turtle was even on its back in its jar.
Animal protection should be seriously involved ...
Other than that, it allows you to discover really strange specimens that you would have thought came out of the cretausaur ...

(Original)
Musée en piteux état.  Visité un jour de pluie ça ne doit pas aidé. C'est très artisanal de petits aquariums anciens bricolés à la main dans lesquels survivent les tortues sans le moindre espace pour nager...
Une tortue était même sir le dos dans son bocal.
La protection des animaux devrait s'en mêler sérieusement...
A part cela, ça permet de découvrir des spécimens vraiment étranges que l'ont croirait sortis du crétausaure..."

Yoga Mala,5,Good space with good classes. Good location. Friendly and helpful teachers.
Yoga Mala,5,I love this place!! It’s my Go-To Yoga relaxation place! Teachers are professional & humourous! I always feel super recharged after every single class. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yoga Mala,5,"I have just completed my 200 YTT course at Yoga Mala.  Raj and Krunal are the best yoga teachers that I have ever met.  It was a  privilege for me to learn Yoga from both of them.

One morning, we had a pranayama, breathing skill, lesson on the grass near the river. It was so refreshing and it helped me to understand Yoga more.  I also liked to listen to many stories from Raj and Krunal, who had a lot of experiences and knowledge.

Through this course, I have leaned more of Yoga than I expected.  As Raj said, I am going to digest slowly what I learned there."
Yoga Mala,5,"Just completed my 200H Hatha Vinyasa YTT and I'm so glad I chose Yoga Mala! I originally chose the YTT for its very reasonable price and focus on anatomy, but came away with way more: a lovely batch of new friends, an introduction to the holistic mental, spiritual and physical practice of yoga (philosophy, anatomy, history), and of course way better alignment.

Thank you Raj and Krunal for being patient, thorough and fun teachers who really practise what they preach and inspire me to teach yoga in the most authentic way possible. I really enjoyed anatomical explorations with Raj, learning how the asanas, pranayama, and other branches fit into yogic philosophy, and realising how to deepen my poses in Krunal's energetic and detailed classes.

I would recommend the studio to anyone and am hoping to be back soon! (:"
Yoga Mala,5,"I just completed my YTT 200 and the smaller group during this period was nice.

Raj and Krunal know Yoga from the roots and this is what I was looking for. We did not only focus on asanas but also we learned pranayama practices (breathing practices), yoga philosophy, history and yoga lifestyle. Raj was really patient, good teacher, knowledgeable and specialist in pranayama practices. Krunal is a very good yoga teacher especially in ashtanga.

Overall good quality of class, teacher professional and knowledgeable, very good value for money. Highly recommended."
Yoga Mala,5,"I have just completed my YTT200 with Yoga Mala. It was a nice experience, and the class was conducted in a much smaller group which would allow the instructor, Rajesh to focus on candidates more.

Rajesh was knowledgeable and patient throughout in yoga classes. Not just focus on asana but he also explained all the anatomy, pranayama, and yoga Nidra throughout all the classes. Rajesh is also specialised in pranayama exercises, the yoga breath controlling technique which helps us in keeping us connected to our breath. I personally find it very helpful to reduce my anxiety in various ways.

I am glad that I attended and completed my YTT200 with Yoga Mala.

Yoga Mala YTT course offers extraordinary value for money. Yoga Mala is the best choice for both YTT and yoga classes. Highly recommended."
Yoga Mala,5,"I have completed 200hrs YTT with Raj and Mien and graduated in Oct 2019. The YTT comprises the practice of Asana, Pranayama, Anatomy, Chanting, Meditation, Yama & Niyama, Yoga philosophy.
We need to complete a daily journal, 10 yoga observation classes, 10 teachings, and exams.

Raj is very knowledgeable in Asana and Anatomy. Raj is a strict yoga instructor. He respects the principle and originality of yoga. The development of yoga has been greatly influenced by dance moves and other factors, and Raj explained it to us how the posture has changed and what is the most primitive way of practicing yoga.

Mien is specializing in Yoga Philosophy and Theory. It's really interesting to understand Yoga from another perspective, where we are not only practicing physically but it is also to understanding and improving our mental and spiritual self.

I truly appreciate every lessons and time spent in Yoga Mala. Namaste."
Yoga Mala,5,"The BEST yoga experience ever. I bought this voucher on Fave and didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of teachers and classes. Raj, the main instructor is really amazing. He helped me with my knee and back issues and customized postures for me during the class! I saw him give individual attention to all the students in his class.
The classes are very small so you get enough space and personal attention from the teachers.
Would highly recommend!"
Yoga Mala,5,"This is my first time yoga - prenatal yoga. I have been follow through Raj's class the whole pregnancy, I must say the entire experience is really nice. Overall I have not experienced any swollen hands and feet and able to maintain good energy level. Lady at the counter is friendly too, she makes you felt warm and welcome everytime."
Yoga Mala,5,"Did my Yoga Teacher Training 200Hours at Yoga Mala with Raj last year. He is very patient, dedicated and knowledgeable. Classes are small and conducive. Best decision to be training under him. The YTT course is challenging yet, rewarding. Thank you for the experience."
Yoga Mala,5,"One of the best yoga studios I've found in Singapore, and a mainstay in my fitness/wellness routine after plenty of studio hopping on my fitness pass for the last three years.

Classes by Mien and Raj are consistently fantastic, and a great way to unwind while deepening your practice at the same time.

Their classes are a cosy size and strike a unique balance between being challenging yet safe, and grounding--because each practice encourages greater self-awareness and understanding.

Mien and Raj been so helpful in my journey of personal development, and I can't recommend Yoga Mala highly enough!"
Yoga Mala,5,"Thumbs-up for the prompt assistance given by the staff there (in terms of replying emails, attending queries). Classes were pretty small and it fees like we’re attending the private session. Teachers were helpful by correcting our postures as and when. Definitely recommending this place to newbie as they do have huge range of classes with varying level of difficulties. Thank you Yoga Mala for the great service. Keep up the cleanliness and flexibility in booking and rescheduling our classes as and when!"
Yoga Mala,1,"I am rating the studio 1 star in this review because this morning's class was cancelled again at the last minute, which is very disrespectful of one's time and energy."
Yoga Mala,5,Whatever your level you will enjoy the sessions. The instructors ensure that each one is challenged and is progressing. Great location if you work close to Raffles Place
Yoga Mala,5,The place to relax after a long day's work! The instructors are sincere and they have a balance in moving you along within your own limits. Staff there are really helpful especially when there are personal scheduling issues! (Flexibility within reason) appreciate their efforts!
Yoga Mala,5,"I’m thankful to discover this yoga studio 2 years ago and has never looked back ever since. Classes are therapeutic with very dedicated, patient and friendly instructors. I thoroughly enjoy every session and highly recommend everyone to come forward and explore their practice at Yoga Mala!"
Yoga Mala,5,Great location. and nice yoga studio and teachers. First tried this package on fave and have never looked back!
Yoga Mala,5,"Classes:
Unlike many studios in Singapore, Yoga Mala really provides a unique offering - Yoga classes in small class sizes with very experienced teachers at a great price with bright and airy studios and a central location.  I always walk away from class feeling refreshed and that I've learned so much.  The classes are great for beginners and there is great focus on alignment and posture.  Mien's intermediate class is also really challenging and great for those who are trying to level up.  I also love the Yoga Nidra classes as there are very few studios that offer this - pure relaxation and great for those new to meditation as well.  Highly recommend you give the classes a try.

YTT 200:
I completed the YTT training at Yoga Mala with Raj and Mien in March.  What a truly rewarding experience.  Both teachers were extremely knowledgeable, patient and offered constructive feedback.  I feel like my practice improved 10x and have been given the confidence and boost to start my teacher journey.  There is so much more to learn but I feel that Yoga Mala has really given me the best foundation, and I would argue better than any other studios in Singapore.  If you want to learn more about  the theory and history, different styles of yoga and really deepen your meditation practices along with your asana practice- I can't recommend Yoga Mala enough!"
Yoga Mala,1,The studio simply canceled the class without notification. Registered members only got to know on the spot when the they travelled all the way to the studio.
Yoga Mala,5,"I started my yoga practice here as a beginner and have now progressed to intermediate level with the help of the teachers here. The number of students per class is less and teachers give good amount of personal attention. The teachers are properly trained and certified,  have solid grounding on the basics of yoga practice and even help the students with their spiritual practice like Yoga Nidra and meditations which goes beyond the normal asanas. Special mention to teachers like Mien and Raj who are always available for a deeper conversation or extra support to help a student get up to speed. I recommend this studio as this differs from most of the other commercial studios that one finds all over Singapore. Well rooted good glasses with qualified teachers."
Yoga Mala,5,"Recently i went to Singapore for business meeting. I was completely exhausted with my business meetings and decided to visit some yoga studio. After few minutes of search, i called several yoga studios in Singapore and finally thought of giving a shot to Yoga Mala. I attended 3 Yoga Mala classes and believe me it was unbelievably shooting and relaxing. Thank you Yoga Mala for such a blissful experience."
Yoga Mala,5,"Started doing yoga at this studio and the instructors here are so friendly and encouraging. Even though i'm new, I never felt intimidated to attend any class because the instructors will always provide you with modifications and encourage you to try. great place to start learning yoga!"
Yoga Mala,5,"The instructor was sincere and instructive, while offering advice for varying levels of difficulties in yoga poses for newcomers not yet flexible enough for the more strenuous positions. Location is great, and the size of the class is perfect."
Yoga Mala,5,"Went twice to the free yoga classes on Sundays. Class size was very small and the instructor gave very detailed guidance to each of us based on our different level of experience. He was encouraging to get us to challenge our limits but not at all pushy. Studio is simple but well-maintained and sufficient with facilities like shower toiletries, lockers and even hair dryers. A very pleasant experience!!"
Yoga Mala,5,"I am glad I've found Yoga Mala. I did not look for any place to just do physical exercise. Rather, I tired to find a place where I can grow further. And I found this place. Thank you for the classes that help me rediscover my strength, peace and potential. Thank you for the space which is simple but full with good energy."
Yoga Mala,5,great location with passionate instructors! awesome experience thus far! would definitely recommend :)
Yoga Mala,5,Have been attending yoga classes here and it has helped deepen my practice. Teachers are fantastic and a good size studio as well.
Yoga Mala,5,Great location at the CBD area and a convenient place to get a good stretch after work. Place is clean and Instructors are really friendly too!
Yoga Mala,5,Wonderful experience at Yoga Mala with dedicated and experienced Teachers. I have truly enjoyed my lessons since I have joined 2 years back.
Yoga Mala,5,"I had been practicing with Yoga Mala since they opened for almost 3 years and had never looked back since. The yoga instructors are humble, dedicated & friendly. The class is unprentious and good size unlike the commercialised yoga studios. Highly recommend this yoga studio along Circular Road / Raffles Place."
Yoga Mala,5,"Discovered Yoga Mala through Fave app and regretted I did not buy the 8 sessions. 4 classes that I had with Yoga Mala have successfully hypnotized myself to learn more about Yoga. Classes were pretty small and it definitely make you feel like you’re having a private sessions. Service were great, staffs were helpful and they went the extra mile to get us comfortable especially in the changing room (There were make up removers & hair dryer!!) Definitey will be back again to sign up for more packages and you guys shoyld definitely come down and experience it for yourself!"
Yoga Mala,5,"I have enjoyed my classes at Yoga Mala (1+ months) instructor Rajesh is sincere in his practice and emphasises on safety. Variation in poses are provided for students of different abilities. The classes are well paced and welcoming for individuals new to yoga or to their studio. Clean and well maintained facilities. Mats, shower toiletries lockers and water are provided while towels are available at a nominal sum. Foresee myself spending more time at Yoga Mala to deepen my practice. Strongly recommended!"
Yoga Mala,5,"This Yoga studio is professional, neat and has good instructors. Location is the plus point as it is located near Boat Quay. They provide Mats and towels.  There are range of classes which varies from variety to difficulty level.  Minimum class price is $30 (drop in rate).  They have toilet and locker facility as well. I strongly recommend this studio. Thanks.."
Yoga Mala,5,I am a new bee to yoga and yoga mala helped me to hang in in this journey. It's location is plus point. Yoga studio is quite good.
Yoga Mala,5,"Classes are simple, yet thoughtfully designed with the opportunity to learn newer concepts. Thanks to the lovely teachers for making Yoga more interactive and an enjoyable habit out of us."
Yoga Mala,4,"Review of YOGA MALA's 200HR YTT COURSE
PROS:
• Thorough explanation of muscles and bone structure, ensuring safe alignment.
• Clear framework for constructing a yoga class, and practiced teaching to other students in class, get used to speaking.
• Good balance of spiritual and physical practice - getting us to practice ahimsa and more gave an additional layer of awareness to what we were learning, that yoga is not just about physical poses. This is main reason why I chose this place because a lot of other studios do not offer this. (I even practiced loving kindness to cockroaches)
• Patient and kind when answering our many questions
• Encouraged us to think for ourselves and come to our own conclusions instead of listening to all the outside sources.
• Practical hours required post course is gruelling and troublesome, at the same time, it is invaluable in teaching you to be comfortable teaching. Early nervousness is normal.
• Extended understanding and kindness to me when I was super late in submitting my post course videos as I had surgery. They waived off my late fee for two extra months which is very generous and I am thankful for that.
CONS:
• Not enough time on instructing students to get into proper alignment. Only half a day spent on this topic.
• Big problem: Classes veer off topic so we had to rush through remaining topics during last week.
• Have alot of questions but no time to have them thoroughly answered.
• Only require two books - orange one and main A4 book, plus purple book at later stages. The other two were not used at all and when we referenced these books, we were told not to listen to the book.
• No reply on class structure after graduation, could be because Raj was away but really no reply so gave up after awhile.
• Difficult to fulfil practical hours post course - hard to find students and locations. Understand that teaching paying customers is not fair, at the same time, big problem was actually finding a location.
• Abit too much to do for course, difficult to juggle with rigors of working life - like finding time to practice at home and teach people. At the same time, nothing good comes without difficulty and effort.
BUILDS:
• Syllabus is needed - framework of timetable, week 1, 2, 3. Each week and each lesson must hit these key points for example. This helps provide clarity between teacher and students on what they will be teaching and learning each week. Each party is accountable week by week.
• Have a q&a channel - either set aside two hours at the end of week for questions with students, or if more students, provide them a specific email to email questions.
• Cut out the two extra books that were not used, offer them as additional supplemental reading. Earmark parts that you feel is helpful and useful for students that will justify the money they spend.
• Get students to finish all class structure first and clear with teacher before course finishes. Opportunity to teach alot more when it comes to different types of peak poses.
• Offer attic space for students to teach their friends. Offer it during non peak timings like afternoon lull where there's no official classes would be great to open up to students.
OVERALL SUMMARY:
Mien and Raj are not superhuman and do not put up pretenses trying to be, they are honest and transparent that they are human as well and are here to learn from the students as much as they are here to impart their knowledge. They are also trying their best. This led to comfortable atmosphere of asking questions and learning which is very rare to find.
Yes, there needs to be more structure with the course syllabus and this is easily addressed. Do you feel well prepared to go out and teach? No, there needs to be more practice in teaching and correcting, and again, can be fixed with a syllabus tweak, not a problem.
Come here if you want a solid foundation in anatomy, alignment and spiritual tenets of yoga. Be prepared for a time intensive course, and stick to the long hours because you will realize how fulfilling this course can feel later down the road."
Yoga Mala,5,"I attended the 200hr full time YTT mainly taught by Raj. He was patient, knowledgable, and kind. I especially love the parts where he told stories about his yoga journey in India, Malaysia, etc. It made me realise that having an experienced YTT instructor really makes a huge difference.

Content wise, the course was holistic in terms of its breadth, covering yamas, niyamas, asanas, pranayama, yoga history, philosphy, meditaton, yoga nidra (my favourite), and those who are open even got to practice various shatkarmas.

On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I like how everything was so authentic, and also how it's not an over-the-top hyped up experience. Just simple, down-to-earth, peaceful yoga.

More than thankful for the experience.

(Totally value for money!!!)"
Yoga Mala,1,"Class size small, instructors far from experienced. Will not come back."
Yoga Mala,5,"I had taken and taught yoga-based classes for a few years before enrolling in Yoga Mala’s 200 hour teacher training program. However, I felt that I was lacking in my understanding of yogic philosophy, postures and human physiology and wanted to improve my own technique and ability to instruct. Prior to the course, I felt this was only possible through hours of practicing asanas. However, as we progressed through the four weeks, I found the course to be a great blend of theory and practice. Our trainer Rajesh emphasized the importance of developing body awareness as the key to improving our practice and teaching skills and this has been my biggest take-away from the course. The training also taught me how to develop effective and well-balanced sequences, deliver clear instructions as well as modify poses and I have received a lot of positive feedback from participants in my classes as a result. The requirements for completing the course included 10 hours of practical teaching and 10 hours of observing classes covering various yoga styles. Though daunting at first, these turned out to be instrumental in helping me enhance my skills as a teacher. Yoga Mala provided a lot of support in helping me complete these requirements including opportunities to teach classes at their studio and attending classes of other instructors.
I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their knowledge of yoga theory, understanding of asanas and teaching skills."
Yoga Mala,1,"Did not have a good experience at this place. The changing rooms are pretty bad, the shower curtains useless. The yoga room is average.
I had some prepaid class membership, but could not attend due to some important family matters and the membership expired un-used. He would not consider and give me an extension of my membership. So all in all - did not like the service as well!"
Yoga Mala,5,great location and the classes are always re-invigorating
Yoga Mala,5,Finally I found my regular spot to do yoga. They have attractive and flexible packages to choose from.
Yoga Mala,5,Location is convenient and instructors are very passionate :)
Yoga Mala,5,"I looked around for YTT courses and found that many were very much commercialised till i met Raj and Mien at the info session. They are sincere and down-to-earth and live the essence of yoga.

If you're only looking for a textbook, spoon feeding style of training one to just recite asana instructions or make mechanic adjustment, this course may not fit you as well.

But if you're looking for a holistic understanding of yoga including philosophy, pranayama, meditation, principles of anatomy (that builds the foundation for asana and adjustment), and to lead a yogic life on a daily basis, this is for you.

Theory wise, we were required to generate instructions based on the basics and the underlying rationale behind each asana, rather than just rote memory. We were often asked to go into poses to experience the difference if it was a wrong alignment or engagement, so that we know how to fine tune and internalise our instructions.

On a personal level, I was prepared to commit myself to all the requirements clearly stated on the website - to practice quiet time, asana, pranayama, reflection on code of conduct, and keep a gratitude journal ON A DAILY BASIS. It was definitely tough, but it was life changing, and i benefited greatly from it.

All in all, it's not an easy cause and you've to be committed to it. If you're ready to commit, this is one place that you'll learn beyond asanas. The full understanding of the essence of yoga will be a life-changing experience."
Yoga Mala,5,"I did not have any expectations nor realise how much positive effect the Yoga Teacher Training has had in my life. But it is here unquantifiably. It is not like a fireworks-like surge of excitement. It came gently and quietly to anchor in the back of my mind, and I think it will stay there for a long time.

The lead teacher Raj Raushan is a smart, thorough, patient and funny guy! He went through all the materials and requirements (imposed by Yoga Alliance) thoroughly, in an orderly and logically organised manner. All subjects were explained, analysed, commented and left for further personal thoughts. The training structure is well balanced between all the subjects instead of mainly focusing on asanas like many other trainings (I later realised this when talking to other yoga teacher trainees from other schools). While studying asanas, the focus was alignment and safety according to each person’s own body and anatomy. We are all made differently in the end, so you can’t just rigidly apply the same rule to everyone of us.

The best thing I like about Raj is that he trained the future teachers to UNDERSTAND instead of just applying what was previously said. To answer a trainee’s question, he would ask back other questions leading to a more basic understanding of things and lead the trainee to use basic understanding arrive to his/her own answer or conclusion of a more complex matter. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. I find that I have gained great basic understanding all most subjects (asanas, anatomy, pranayama, kriyas, mudras, bandhas, yoga history, culture and philosophy) with Raj’s guidance, from which I could either go deeper with more YTT or deepen the practice on my own. Was I able to do more exotic and complicated poses after the YTT? Probably only one or two. Did I improve my asanas (which is most people go after most of the time) after the YTT? Greatly, in terms of alignment. But most important, the training brought my mind to a state in which I firmly believe anything is possible.

The thing about yoga practice in general or yoga teacher training in particular is that it is your own practice. The teacher is there to guide you through only, the rest is up to you. It is totally up to you to go deeper or stay shallow, up to you to commit or not. Whether it is a part-time or full-time training, it requires a lot of efforts and commitment to understanding – yoga is not a mere workout – and to progress and success, within a relatively short amount of time. Before you decide to commit on a training, read the syllabus carefully, come to YTT-info session, ask questions and manage your expectations. Try to understand what the true yoga is about (i.e. not just asanas), what you expect from the training (more asanas or a comprehensive understanding of all yogic aspects), and choose the training accordingly.

One last word. I value the teacher’s efforts and the teacher-student mutual respect and relationship. The teacher is not simply a service provider to whom you paid and from whom you expect treatments as though you are an “I-am-always-right” customer. The money you paid is nothing compare to the knowledge he passes on to you. Thank you Raj and Yoga Mala’s other teacher Mien. I really appreciate your time and efforts, patience and guidance, but you know that already."
Yoga Mala,5,The instructor is very experience and patient. The studio is cozy!
Yoga Mala,5,"I enjoy the morning classes with Rajesh alot. Especially the hatha and flow classes. Lot of emphasis on pranayama which helps me go deeper into the practice. His sequence is very well-balanced, challenging yet invigorating.
He is also very patient and encouraging and gives us the space to explore.
Looking forward to my next class, always."
Yoga Mala,5,Couple of months back i was in Singapore and was looking for some professional help to ease out my stress. I went for Yoga Nidra and regular meditation class for 3 days and it helped a lot to shed lot of stress and tiredness. I must tell that i am quite impressed with Mr. Rajesh who is owner of Yoga Mala. I wish this studio and Mr. Rajesh all success ahead.
Yoga Mala,5,"Great venue, Excellent Yoga Center, Excellent Yoga Guidence"
Yoga Mala,5,Authentic yoga experience!

Marina Country Club Singapore,5,Great place to chill with good eateries
Marina Country Club Singapore,5,Fun very good. the caption is very friendly and my son caught a red snapper with a lot of catfishs and grouper. I strongly recommend you going there. P.S be aware to bring hats and since the boat is fast do not let your hat go on the ocean.
Marina Country Club Singapore,5,Some events going on now faster go.. awesome place to visit...
Marina Country Club Singapore,4,Fishing & prawning spot. The Marina where you deck your boat. Small place
Marina Country Club Singapore,4,"Quaint place to relax if you are in punggol area. Nice food, great sunset view. Go for a beer by the pier n chill or have some fun fishing for fish or river prawns"

Marina Country Club Singapore,5,Beautiful place to have your morning/afternoon jog with the sight of sun rise/sun set. Breezy air chill atmosphere. Along the end of the stretch at punggol end theres a convenience store such as 7-11.
HSBC Rain Vortex,5,Spectacular indoor waterfall within the Jewel Changi Airport. Iconic structure/feature that's great for taking photos.
HSBC Rain Vortex,5,"It is definitely one of the places which never fails to amuse you, doesn’t matter how many times you visit it. It’s one of the architectural marvels in Singapore and a must visit place, except on public holidays and weekends (to avoid huge crowd). It kind of creates calmness due to the sound of the waterfall."
HSBC Rain Vortex,4,Perfect spot for photo taking!

Harley-Davidson of Singapore,5,"Came here this morning for a test ride of the 2020 Electra Glide Standard.  Andrew was accommodating, patient and understanding.  Love the ride and hope to join the HD fraternity soon."
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,1,"Just visited the shop at Alexandra  this morning(7/6/21) at 9am to get some spare parts for my bike. I already called Harley Davidson hotline yesterday 6/6/21 to check the operation time for spare part department to check stock availability. They told me they have the last set of the item and I can just drop by may be 9-930am to buy it. I also double check with him that if I reach about 915-930am should be no problem to collect the item. So move forward to this morning incident. I reach the outlet at 9am and went to the counter the guy at the counter told me to wait at the waiting area and told me that the spare Part department guy( jerry or Jeral) will normally arrive latest 930am. So I don’t mind checking the retail section for a while and chill till 9.30am. But when around 9.35am another lady salesgirl walk over and told me that the spare part sales person will not reach work so early also on MONDAY in particular. I checked with the lady the correct operating hour cause is covid season time of operation might change. But she told me is 8.30am for all sparepart department and retail. So I wait till 930am is already very gracious to them. If u were task me how I feel... I’m not happy at all not that they ruin my plan and also wasted my time. So I just told the staff this is not the right way to do customer service also treat ur customer. This might be the 1st time I’m writing review or complaints. This is not a normal retail shop. This is HARLEY DAVIDSON. But even if is not a famous brand retail shop I don’t think they have the rights to treats customer like this and this is not the right way to do retail and customer service. I am not hoping for any compensation or voucher I just voice it out so that ppl reading this and riding a motorcycle that u have sold to us, will be careful of buying any spare parts in HARLEY DAVIDSON SINGAPORE. Lastly I still love my HARLEY-DAVIDSON motorcycle dearly but not the sales team in the shop. Thanks for reading and May God Bless you all Dan Semoga tuhan berkati
P.s I would have bought it online, is way cheaper and save me more time and trouble. I bet the sale person still haven’t reach the shop after I post this review

P.s p.s just look at the response and reply of this review. This is the customer service of HD Singapore. I’m done and take care guys"
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,5,HD Excellent service and friendly helpful sales staff 👍🏼
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,4,Nice decor and shiny chrome all over the place. Had gone for a test ride of a Iron 1200. Staff is generally friendly and happy to talk about bikes
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,3,"Staff are friendly, helpful and try their best but the workshop operations needs a good internal review. Lead times and quality is just not there unfortunately. Had to bring my bike in several times for the same issue to be fixed (thankfully under warranty)."
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,5,"It’s Harley, do you still need a review on this place? It’s a showroom, you go there and buy big American bikes... well, if you’re in luck you may get a test ride... and oh they offer rentals too... so maybe if you don’t have a Budget to buy, it might be wise to at least consider renting 1 for a weekend to go touring or something... cheers..."
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,5,Singapore harley davidson shop provides good service and nice product.
Harley-Davidson of Singapore,5,Did not know they had a Harley shop here.  Quite surprised needed to check the bikes out.  Decent selection of bikes and apparel.
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"Did my open water with them recently. Whole experience was great and this is coming from a guy who had a fear of diving. Team from Sunny Cove was young and enthusiastic yet very experienced and they ensured that the dives were conducted in a fun and enjoyable manner without safety being compromised at all times. Everything was provided for during the trip, accommodation and meals were good. Looking forward to doing my advanced open water with them very soon!"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,So far one of the best dive experience I've had. Recently took AOW with them in Bali. Very patient and fun to be around.
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"Thanks Sunny Cove for providing such an awesome and awesome and superb underwater experience. The staff were definitely professional, friendly and approachable!

The trip was well planned and they always ensure our safety underwater. I will be back to dive with you guys again and will definitely recommend Sunny Cove to my friends"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"I really enjoyed the dive with Sunny Cove in Tioman. They are professional, responsible, thoughtful and really taking good care of everything. I did my refresher course with Javier. He's patient and nice. He even helped me to go through some skills before the dive to make sure that i am comfortable in water and had me set up my own gear . After the first dive, he gave me comments on what I could have done better to make the dive more enjoyable ! This is one of the dive shops that you guys should try out !"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"Did my Advanced PADI certification, and enjoyed the entire trip.Sunny Cove and their crew are very well organized and professional. Highly recommend them for certification or leisure diving! Will return back to them to do more diving !"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"Really good diving company!

The instructors put safety first, and are very fun!

My two trips with them just went perfect, we saw dolphins, crabs, stingrays...

LOVE IT!"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,5,"Sunny Cove proofed to be an excellent choice. It was great fun and laughter, and they looking after us during our weekend diving trip to Tioman,  I also found their divemaster quite knowledgeable and their equipment to be flawless. All the staff and instructors was so supportive, really friendly and made us feel very safe! It was such an amazing experience!! Would definitely recommend this company!"
Sunny Cove Dive Centre,4,"Went for a leisure trip to Tioman and was really nice. Had a very good time there, dives and logistics where great, did a lot in just a weekend. I definitely recommend Sunny Cove to anyone who wants a good dive!"
Mandai Track 15,5,Nice walk here from Mandai entrance down to chestnut park. Along the way be careful of MTB bikes speeding past. Stick to the side of the trail.
Mandai Track 15,5,"A good trail to get away from the city from Mandai T15 all the way to hillview, though weekend will be tough as track is shared with bikers but weekdays a little lesser."
Mandai Track 15,5,Excellent trail with natural terrain and tons of greenery. Hikers - be prepared to have to watch over your backs for cyclists as it is a popular mountain biking trail too!
Mandai Track 15,5,The only way I can describe this place is that it is a secret garden in the heart of Singapore that needs to be protected at all costs. Don’t take this away from us!
Mandai Track 15,4,Mandai T15 Trail is best share track for people who tracking & biking and many fruit trees n bamboo trees very nice Flora n fauna
Mandai Track 15,5,"It is a good hiking trail, considered easy to medium difficulty. We diverted to reservoir trail on the way back to bukit panjang. Total journey is around 13.7km"
Mandai Track 15,5,"Good workout, dry terrain today."
Mandai Track 15,5,"A nice easy trail for hikers and cyclists. Watch out for snakes, wild boars and deers."
IB HQ,5,Love this bar. Thought I found my true love after The Library closed down. So sad to find out that they will be moving to Sydney by the end of this month (July). It’s a place where you can find good cocktails that tells a story
IB HQ,5,"A total hidden gem! Despite being an avid cocktail consumer myself, I hadn't heard of IB HQ until dining at sister establishment JAG below. The cocktails are creative and delicious (must try: the bleu cheese martini), the food was tasty (cooked by the JAG team so you know it's good), and the service was outstanding. Will definitely return."
IB HQ,5,"We tried 6 cocktails in a wide variety of flavour profiles and we loved every one of them. Ricky truely is a master of his craft. Cozy room with down to earth welcoming service, amazing food... Looking forward to next time already."
IB HQ,5,"Incredible visit and thanks to Kamil and Hans for explaining their story - Both behind the Cocktail Bar and their creations via the fantastic, unique drink offerings.

I opted for the 'Rookies selection' - A playful and interesting monthly rotation of 3 Cocktails which were all well-balanced and flavours matched perfectly.

The 'Breakfast Negroni' was the star of the selection.

Look forward to visiting again soon to try the Elements experience!"
IB HQ,5,"I've been to countless great bars and made tens of thousands of cocktails myself.
Never have I ever had such good drinks as here.
Hands down best drinks.Ever."
IB HQ,5,"IBHQ focuses on craft. They make their own liqueurs and are inventive in their recipes. Paired with the earnestness of Kamil and his team, this tucked away cocktail bar is a great place to hide away in while the world goes on by. For a fun treat, try the Hong Long, a drink that comes paired with a Togarishi-topped quail egg."
IB HQ,5,The bar is tiny but very cosy. The drinks are fantastic - interesting combinations and totally worth the higher price point. The service from Kamil and his team were excellent - can’t wait to come back and try the new menu.
IB HQ,5,Just awesome! Especially with this gentleman here..
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,4,The tour and routes are quite good to get a first impression of Singapore. The recorded information quite good. The music was annoying after a while and the recording kept crackling which was not helpful either. Also would wish for a route to take out of the city centre and show more of the country. Tour of anout 1 hr for each route is not exactly value for money.
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,3,"Long periods of silence on the audio tour with bland music playing other times, while we were there big bus and sightseeing were interchangeable. Expensive but nice variety of tour routes and helpful staff"
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,4,"The Big Bus Tours were fantastic.

We also went on the Night City Tour: Gardens by the Bay- Bugis St Market - Tropical Fruit Sampling : Our guide was superb and it was great chatting to him about Singapore life but the tour itself didn't give much time to explore. Although it was good to go to Chinatown, the night show at Gardens by the Bay and Burgis market, we didn't get enough time at each place."
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,4,"Nice and quick way to explore Singapore
I am used to exploring various cities with this HopOn-HopOff service (Rome, London, Singapore, etc.). They are usually good and offer some information in at least English and half a dozen other languages. The different routes cover different interesting sights. We usually buy two-day tickets, as no city deserves big rush ..."
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,5,Try this before you start making plans. Use this to see the city and then mark down the places you want to visit more later.
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,4,When you have a long transit hours... its best to explore city bus sightseeing rather spending time in the airport. Good experience take through major places in the city. Friendly drivers. Recorded tour guide -earphones- available.
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,5,"Small city easy to see in a short time. Very clean, polite and safe"
My Odyssey Tours - Singapore One-Day Tour,5,"Fantastic tour and the laser show, amazing."
Clique Gaming,5,"Went there with friends and although we faced some issues with mine and my friend's PC, the staff helped to quickly arrange the change to another station. The sofa chairs are very comfortable although visibly dirty, I guess hard to clean due to the fabric material. The back of my earring flew out when I removed the wired headphones and I couldn't find it, but they were very nice to have me leave my contact number and contacted me few days later after finding it! Even for a small item like this. Giving a 5-star for service! Thank you Brighton. :)"
Clique Gaming,4,"Affordable lan shop. Though the seat cushions were smelly and the keyboard/mouse was oily. I would have liked it more if the chairs were make of a material that was easily cleanable so that it wouldn't soak up the sweat of every patron that every used it. Also be warned (although this is not something that the owners of the lanshop can control) that the entire mall smells of Chinese joss incense, the smell will stay on you clothes (and mask)."
Clique Gaming,1,"Went here weekends on a day off to relieve myself instead of going back home. I was not very fond of this LAN shop. Most of the games they have, I don't really play anymore. $2.50 on weekends is kind of expensive considering the fact that their PC don't use SSDs, load time and downloads just consume all your play hours. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Comfy chairs, but a little dirty
-McDonald's outside
-Good service.

Cons:
- Cheap headset, pseudo broken spacebar keyboard but good mouse.
- Severe CPU bottlenecking GPU, which results in poor frame rate, I'm not sure why you need to get a 4k graphic card on a 1080p resolution powered by poor i5-4460 processor. Shouldn't it be other way around so you can have blazing load times? Also who uses Intel. AMD ryzen is better.
- Monitors are 60hz and locked at 1080p resolutions. Brand is Samsung but it's 2020 shouldn't they upgrade to 240hz monitor by now? Good luck dying in fps like R6S and Valorant.
-Slow HDD load times. Again, severe bottlenecking.
-Noisy Dota 2 players.

Overall I felt like my money was cheated. Went to cancel but the boss says there's no way for a refund. Never again."
Clique Gaming,1,Terrible experience. They only had 6 games on their guest steam account. My friends and I sacrificed the 2.50 and left early rather than waste our time here.
Clique Gaming,5,Comfortable and good atmosphere to play pc or ps4!
Clique Gaming,5,"Love this place, warm home feeling, together with friends playing. shiok"
Clique Gaming,3,"Pros:

- good screen size
- good keyboard and mouse
- comfy sofa as a chair
- $2.50, good price

Cons:

- space is a little crammed when gaming
- when timer approaches, popup will abruptly kick you out of the game for a brief second. Bad for online matches.
- Fixed rate. not very flexible. Would prefer if it was a flexible rate so games could end properly and not in the middle of the matches so customers won't receive any penalties ingame for leaving.

Enjoy your time there!"
Clique Gaming,5,Good place to spend time with your friends. Fair pricing & great options for PS4 games. Highly recommended.
Cenotaph,5,"Nice i love it..
The memorial was completed in 1922, and was unveiled on 31 March that year by the young Prince Edward of Wales, later King Edward VIII then Duke of Windsor, during his Asia-Pacific tour. During the unveiling ceremony, a chaplain blessed the Cenotaph with the words, ""The stone is well laid and truly laid to the Glory of God and the memory of the illustrious dead."" Against the backdrop of the sea then fronting Queen Elizabeth Walk, Governor Guillemard awarded medals of courage to those who had served in the war...
Thank you"
Cenotaph,5,Its a war memorial located in Esplanade Park to memorize all the people who died in World War.
Cenotaph,5,The Cenotaph is a memorial of our soldiers who have bravely fought for our nation.
Cenotaph,4,Clean & well maintained.. not much crowded.. it's a memorial for fighters..
Cenotaph,5,"The Cenotaph is a war memorial that honours the brave men who died during World Wars I and II.

Sitting amid the lush Esplanade Park along Connaught Drive, this towering monument—nearly 60-feet high and made from local granite—is in a quiet spot in the Central Business District, away from the buzz of neighbouring streets.

Designed by architect Denis Santry of Swan & McLaren, the Cenotaph was modelled after the 1920 Sir Edwin Lutyens Whitehall Cenotaph in London.

The Cenotaph was unveiled on 31 March 1922 by the Prince of Wales, who became King Edward VIII and later, Duke of Windsor.

On 28 December 2010, it was gazetted as a National Monument collectively with two other structures in Esplanade Park, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial and the Tan Kim Seng Fountain."

The Star Vista,5,"[Post Covid-19]
Entrances are limited to 3 places to enter and exit the Star Vista due to safe distancing and Trace Together. It's still a great place to hangout and meet friends and family however it is busy during weekends. So do call in earlier to check if there's queue for restaurants.

A great place for students to meetup and often there's a crowd at the rooftop of Star Vista at night however something to note is that the rooftop closes at 10pm sharp."
The Star Vista,5,"Accessible from car Park to mall . No hassle.
Many decent shops in the mall , and restaurants are a few to choose too.
Quite like this place.. not so crowded like other town mall.."
The Star Vista,1,"Yawn worthy selection of shops and restaurants, extortionate Sunday parking rates !!! 5.50 for less than 2 hours!!! and they don’t even have to spend on aircon in the mall …. Pure greed on full display, no wonder no one coming to the shops"
The Star Vista,5,This mall is pretty good to spend quality time. Have many restaurants and a space to relax!
The Star Vista,5,"Nice place for lunch! Nice parking lots, many food to choose from. Supermarket and entertainment stuffs available"
The Star Vista,5,Great service and excellent haircut from James. Location is great and spacious.
The Star Vista,4,"This mall is conveniently located beside Buona Vista MRT, it's designed as eco friendly and half the mall is open air concept. They have a large resting area where you can enjoy the breeze during the evening.

With a mixed genes of stores, you will find see 2 grocery stores within the mall, Cold Storage and a Japanese market.

For animals lovers, there's a pet store, Pet Safari which also serve coffee / tea while you enjoyed the company of pets. A vet is located beside.

F&B occupies most of the mall and you will be able to find great varieties of cuisines."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,"Another place that deserves 6 stars. I've been looking for that great local micro brewery and I finally found it. I tried 3 beers, and liked each one. You can get Grab to deliver food if you're hungry, and you'll never go wrong with the drinks."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,4,"Visited last Sunday. Its a chill, cozy setup located deep in the ubi industrial area. However, due to limited seating, we were seated outside and served with plastic cups. Beers were generally quite decent."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,4,"Best craft beers and different flavours.
Good for small groups.
No finger food, but you can order from any online food delivery platforms and consume it here."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,"Bought 1x6 pack of their Vienna Lager - Yesterday Once More and 1x6pack of the NE pale ale - Lean on Me, via their webstore. The delivery came the next day packed in a beautiful box holding both 6 packs with really adorable beer labels. Apparently, there will be savings to be reaped if the 6 packs are purchased directly from the tasting room itself.

Their takeaway options include growlers (64 oz/32 oz) as well.

I particularly enjoy both of these beers - lean on me for the fruity aromas with low bitterness, as well as the Vienna Lager for its toastiness."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,"I patron the place regularly for their beers and bought their growler. The growler is good, keeps the beer at its intended temperature up till the next day even though growler was left at room temperature. Beer still tastes fresh as though just poured from the tap. Once opened, recommended to finish all though, as beer will turn flat if not consumed long after opening the airtight growler.

Can be bought on webstore as well"
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,"A local microbrewery nestled in the middle of an industrial estate, you'd have to be looking for this place to find it! Very interesting range of craft beers,  all brewed on site and in house. Beer lovers would have to give this place a try at least once! No reservations and no food (have to tabao your own)."
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,"The most hidden, and also the best local brewery in Singapore so far. We tried the IPAs, the bock and the stout. Everything was really delicious especially the IPAs. The place is quite small so come early and bring your own food. Hope they can start selling their beers islandwide soon"
Pink Blossoms Brewing,5,Definitely the best local brewery in SG by far. Awesome variety of beers on tap and what better to chase the rainy days away! Do give their signature milk stout ‘Hundred Years’ a try. Love how they remain innovative and constantly push the limits in brewing various types of beer.
The Queen & Mangosteen,4,"Nice British ambience and food. The Smoked Duck Salad was great! The Fish Taco was also delicious. Both are on promotion at $12.90++ for lunch and are highly recommended. The Pork Bangers & Mash was nice but serving was small for price ($25++). Have choice of indoor seating or outdoor. Friendly staff, quick service."
The Queen & Mangosteen,4,"We enjoyed the steak! The bread pudding (dessert), not so much."
The Queen & Mangosteen,3,Food was not. Impressive. Was rather hit n missed. Drinks were more appealing than the dishes here.
The Queen & Mangosteen,4,"Such a nice place to chill at weekend with friends. You can order some drinks under happy hour promotion like 1 for 1 cocktails or with a lower price for beer. Specially, they have a great dessert, which I highly recommended to give it a try 😋"
The Queen & Mangosteen,5,"Pie is a must-have. We ordered chicken mushroom fillings. Crab cake passable, but not too impressive. There is 1 for 1 promotion for cocktail before 8pm."
The Queen & Mangosteen,5,The chicken pie was very delicious and worth the wait. It was piping hot and tasty. The King's burger was good too but expensive as it was wagyu beef.
The Queen & Mangosteen,5,"Friendly staff, awesome view. Food is good too! Will be back!"
The Queen & Mangosteen,3,"Food is great, enjoyed the chicken and pie 🥧. Service is still as terrible. Mgmt can definitely improve their process (no fault with the server & staff) staff is doing their best. If the Mgmt cannot bother to be always improving, do not blame the staff."
Acid Bar,5,"I love this place. I was there a few times and definitely will come over again. The selection of cocktails is excellent; you can find both classics and local signature specialties. Spirits used for cocktails are better-ranked labels with a good reputation and high quality. I had their whiskey sour, old-fashioned on Buffalo Trace, and signature Rikshaw Sazerac. It tasted pretty good! During the happy hours, you can get 1 for 1. The selection of food is not that wide; it is not a dining place. But from I had everything tasted 👍. Menu divided into hot/cold sides. I had lobster roll (very good), tartes with caviar and pita with hummus and baba ganoush. Nice place to spend afternoon!"
Acid Bar,5,Great ambience here! The servers were so lovely ☺️ great personalities! Pictured is Belle’s Punch. I have to say it is absolutely delicious and has a delicate and sweet rose flavour. A must order in my opinion.
Acid Bar,4,"Environment is good. The bacon & mushroom pizza is delicious! Just one thing not that satisfied me - Not every seat can directly see the stage part because of being blocked by the pillars in the bar. But, in overall, it is still recommended. The singers' singing skills are good."
Acid Bar,5,Great place to chill out and nice food. Waiter are all very nice and friendly. There is also live music. Great place to Chill out with friend after Long day stress work.
Acid Bar,5,Looking forward for at least 5pax for gathering with friends
Acid Bar,4,"Good place to sit and relax, visited when not so busy so easy to choose good comfortable spot. Menu has Asian and western varieties plus good happy hour drinks. Food is good quality and service is friendly"
Acid Bar,5,Used to patronise this bar for years. It has both the option of dining inside and outside. Held a few meetings here with clients as well. Staff  customer service was also great ! Can’t wait to patronise again once restrictions are mellowed down
Acid Bar,4,"Decent bar in a great location. The cocktails are fine, wines are middling, but it's a good outside spot near Orchard Road. Prices aren't too bad. The service is decent by Singapore standards. I'd go again though wouldn't necessarily rush back."
Isetan Scotts,3,"What used to be one of the most happening shopping havens, the other being Takashimaya, in the 1980-90s era, unfortunately it has failed to reinvent itself.

What is good about this Departmental Store? Japanese themed food items in Basement, they have a Superdry outlet and perpetual sales of sporting goods on L3. Frequently they do pop up stores to fill the excess space"
Isetan Scotts,4,"Quality seafood and raw fish sushi and sashimi, served conveyor belt style. To ensure freshness, it claims that whatever goes on the conveyor belt only travels 350m, and gets disposed after (seems a tad wasteful though).
For those who aren’t keen on what’s offered on the conveyor belt, you can order what you want and it’s served straight to you via the express belt.
Overall legit experience since the chain hails from Japan. Their limited dishes - snow crab when I visited - are worth trying."
Isetan Scotts,5,"Happy to support retail establishments such as Isetan, especially since there are good buys due to the quiet retail scene. Bought a Herschel backpack at more than 50% discount. The basement supermarket and bakery are also great places for picking up fresh food/bread."
Isetan Scotts,4,Now isetan  hv progress w better looking items?!😜
Isetan Scotts,5,Items are fresh. Tasty bread from the bakery.
Isetan Scotts,4,"Up to date items. Complete.
Well display.
Good services.
Nice place to shop.
Thanks."
Isetan Scotts,4,One of the best place to buy Japanese groceries.
Isetan Scotts,5,Renovated and quite good now. There’s a few new restaurants inside and also the supermarket downstairs are still Japanese themed.
Punggol Park,5,"We really enjoy the park by our 14 month baby/ toddler here. Absolutely greenery place to relax, lot of big trees, combined with picturesque lakes, areas for exercise, cycling, jogging, dog walking, outdoor playground with slides and sand for kids. The vibe is great and youthful. Will come back!"
Punggol Park,5,"Perfect place for morning walk and evening .
Has a perfect golden hour dusky light in the evening.

Ambience boosts the mood.

Scattered enthusiastic people walks, jogs, stroll their evening in style."
Punggol Park,5,A very nice place ...
Punggol Park,5,A quiet park for a short bike ride or jog while waiting for my son to end his enrichment class nearby at Hougang Mall. Will definitely come here more often!
Punggol Park,5,Beautiful park to enjoy nature and cycle 👍
Punggol Park,5,The flowers are in full bloom at Punggol Park. I love how the sun strikes at each tree 🌲 It feels as if I’m in the woods somewhere out of Singapore. There’s so much serenity facing the lake while meditating. The public toilet is clean too!
Punggol Park,4,It is a great place for a ride as there are a lot of trees and plants. There are roads for bicycles and pedestrian . A playground is also available for kids under 10 years old.
Punggol Park,4,Love the park . The greens are soothing to the eyes n mind.
CulinaryOn,4,"It was so fun cooking with my colleagues and learning how to make our own fresh pasta. The pasta making and the creamy mushroom pasta ranked tops in experience. Cooking chicken in tomato broth and making chocolate cake was so so. We came at 6:30pm and we were already hungry so we started nibbling on our ingredients! We didn't get to eat till 9pm! Culinary served us good wine but it would be great of there were some snacks, too."
CulinaryOn,5,"Got to know of this place through my gym VirginActive’s new members night. Overall it was an exhilarating experience to say the least. The entire organization was well thought out, allowing us flexibility and responsibility over the food we make yet ensuring we don’t screw up (too much) and have fun in the process. Chefs and hosts were really easy going and fun and cracked a lot of jokes. We could make pasta from scratch (end product was rather hard though but maybe it was because we added too much flour) and also a chocolate lava cake which turned out really good.

They can handle large groups as they have 3 kitchens, and we have maybe close to 100 pax. We were then split into tables with up to 10 per table, and assigned tasks to do. It was a pity not everyone gets to participate in everything but they did ensure there’s quite a bit of tasks to do, and the most exciting part is definitely rolling out the pasta dough and running it through the grinder. However we didn’t actually cook the pasta ourselves but watch the chefs and some volunteered participants do it. I would say it’s a good blend of opportunity for networking and have some hands on activity but don’t expect to be able to cook a full blown dish from start to end on your own.

Appreciated the canapés and drinks at the start to ensure we are not hungry. Staff are super friendly and engaging, there were ample gloves given and also emphasis on hygiene is ensured. There’s also elements of surprises like dances, cheers etc. definitely a high energy place!"
CulinaryOn,4,"Great place for a team bonding session. The emcees were fantastic and the Chef was extremely energetic. We learnt how to make fresh pasta and tiramisu. I also liked how there was always a fresh pot of coffee, tea and iced water by the side."
CulinaryOn,4,"A little bit pricey but worth it as it includes snacks and soft drinks. It is a social gathering amongst strangers with same interest, fun and very interactive. At the end of it, you get to bring home a certificate and nicely packaged (via email) receipe. Staff are also helpful and friendly."
CulinaryOn,5,"Fantastic place for Team bonding,  fun loving chefs and conveniently located."
CulinaryOn,5,"absolutely great idea for those who wants to experience and try something new. Awesome people, smooth flow, fun and engaging activities, my boyfriend and I enjoyed the evening at this fantastic place. Special thanks to the team of professionals who makes it happen!"
CulinaryOn,5,"Had a class in Culinaryon recently, it was amazing! Super interactive and all 3 courses meals were really tasty. Looking forward to coming back."
CulinaryOn,5,"Great place!
Had a very good time there! Italian shefs make cooking so easy and fun (with a delicious results) 😀"
Singapore Repertory Theatre,5,"We saw ""The Sound Inside"", an amazing show. Two actors have performed a 100 minutes show with full entertainment.
This is one of the few open theaters in this period. The theater is clean and safe, with social distance measures in place. Fantastic intimacy with the actors and high quality performances"
Singapore Repertory Theatre,5,Nice ambience and very good play! I will come again :)
Singapore Repertory Theatre,5,Accompanying my grandson Bryan to SRT to Gingerbread man performance. He enjoy the show very much and applaud when e performers perform their antics.
Singapore Repertory Theatre,4,A lovely place to watch play.
Singapore Repertory Theatre,5,Very clean with safe distancing in place. Seats removed. Very comfortable.
Singapore Repertory Theatre,3,"It is a great little theatre with lots of interesting plays in Singapore. I have come here a few times with my child and always pleased with their performance. However as I came here today for the Christmas tales I noticed a different approach by the usher at the door. I understand there is always a requirement to have safety check in. The guy purposely blocked my boy from entering in a rather stern way. He is just a 6 yo and having come here before for shows he is simply excited for the show again. I didn’t fluke the way he blocked my boy as if a body guard but I understand that is his job. I hold my boy and told him to wait and he obliged . However moment later as I try to get my boy birth cert number for the guy to check him in,  Caucasian carrying his daughter on his shoulders. He is tall and with his girl is taller of course. The usher told the same thing to ask for kid birth certificate. The guy told the usher that he wants to step in first. Then the usher immediately step aside and said with obliging smile sure sure...and us a local Asian mom with a boy are still blocked out until we finished our check in. After we are done and walked in, the usher quickly walked ik and attended to Caucasian who stepped in ( I don’t know if he did the safety check in) sat comfortably under cold air asked what is the birth cert about. I try to reflect if I was rude or if I have done anything wrong.  I understand this theatre is always more popular among the Caucasian’s than the asians but the way I perceived today is totally disappointing. It is a subtle discrimination. But I still  put up 3 stars for their  great performance"
Singapore Repertory Theatre,5,Visit the Singapore Repertory Theatre & support local art!!
Singapore Repertory Theatre,3,Alot of snobby rich class expats
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,5,I love Joshua Bell ❤️
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,5,Place to listen to chinese music
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,5,Thankful for the government still keeping Chinese Orchestra and music strong. Do lookout for ticket sales on Sistic's website.
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,5,Great music tat they played. So impressed
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,4,Easily access but not so for the handicapped as no special seats for them at the alley
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,3,Nice place. Amazing displays of various musical instruments.
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,3,Any old building restored. Nothing happens there most days except concert times. Not parking available. You have to park in the next building.
Singapore Chinese Orchestra,5,I went here to go to an SNYCO concert. Sounded great!
Rainforest Lumina,5,"Great visit over the weekend on a Sunday night.

We booked in for the Rainforest Lumina then Night Safari after. As others have mentioned, mainly focused around little ones, but still good fun.

Some take-away food & drink options would have been really good, but everything was closed when we visited."
Rainforest Lumina,4,"We booked 815pm and entered the main attraction around 9pm. It’s just a lot of walking and taking pictures of light shows. Two interactive attractions which I feel appeal more to kids. Good for one-time experience. I think the platforms oversell the tickets and put a lot of pressure on employees to keep customers happy. The best part of this trip for me was the dine-in at Ulu cafe! Satay, and carrot cake were really nice after the long wait and walk 😝"
Rainforest Lumina,2,"Not much to see and do... Quite warm but luckily not raining, otherwise cannot go, because it's basically walking around the front half of the zoo at night.

Nothing that fantastic; no ""wow"" factor... So not really worth going if full priced... 🤭 Luckily I paid for the tickets, otherwise the hub going to nag that pay for a trek at night, see some lights, jump here and there and clap clap only... 😅

Expect lots of queueing but there are lots of safe distancing ambassadors to control the crowd."
Rainforest Lumina,4,"Lights with laser beams, decorative and interactive shows"
Rainforest Lumina,4,This is the final season of rainforest lumina and we  took a 7.15 entry. It is a totally a different experience to walk in the zoo at night time. The best part is that we have to follow the lighted trail and the rest of the areas are not lighted which adds to the magical experience. Our 3 year old daughter just loved the place the moment we entered through the dreamy entrance. The two interactive zones were her favourite. A good experience for kids. My daughter was largely running around following the lights and enjoyed a lot.
Rainforest Lumina,1,"Please read this review if you are considering going to Rainforest Lumina. (In a nutshell, give this a hard miss)

First off, the queues for this ""attraction"" were insane, I had booked the 8.15pm slot and arrived early at 8pm and it still took a whole 1 HOUR of queuing before we could even enter the Rainforest Lumina. After entering, there are 3 main activity zones to enter/queue for. Due to social distancing measures, it limited the number of people who could enter at each time, so it took another whole 1 hour in total to queue for all of them, and they were all not worth the time spent. All in all, you'll end up spending more time queuing up than seeing any of the attractions.

Secondly, the ""attractions"" in Rainforest Lumina are barely anything. Even if there were no queues at all, none of the attractions were worth any time. Being a ""light"" focused attraction, the lights were all dim with barely anything impressive, as if they downgraded it each time they reran it. The main attraction is the ""Call of the Wild"" (the rock picture) which is a 2-minute light show of a tiny animal appearing every now and then, with no story and poor music. It is comparable to a 3rd graders doodling on an iPad. The pictures shown on the website are greatly post-processed to be much brighter and nicer, but in reality the lights are so dim and hard to see.

Tldr; Overall, an honest waste of time with absolutely no redeeming value unless you just want an immensely lousy stroll in a dark park with nothing to see. Not even interesting for children as there is barely anything for them to do, with immense stretches of empty unlit paths. Just go for the free lightshow at Gardens by the Bay instead, its a million times better than anything here, no exaggeration."
Rainforest Lumina,2,"It’s a decent add-on if you’re visiting other attractions in the area. But if you’re just here for this, don’t bother. The lightings and interactive installations are mediocre at best. Young couples might like the ambience of the place, but the kids were not impressed."
Rainforest Lumina,5,It was truly magical with beautiful lights. I love it
Sifr Aromatics,5,"I love to purchase unique perfumes for my wife and Sifr Aromatics was the just that kind of place.

They blend their own perfumes here and we had the unique once in a lifetime experience of sniffing Ambergris (whale vomit) used in the production of some scents. It is a special location and highly recommend it. The area is a great place to spend time."
Sifr Aromatics,5,Very professional shop & salesman which made our visit so special by explaining & answering all of our questions. Very nice aromatic scents which will take you to the past in time and back to the present. I recommend this shop to travelers who are interested in those kind of shops.
Sifr Aromatics,5,Lovely place. Beautiful perfume laboratory. Their products and packaging are sophisticated. I bought jasmin body balm and it smells goooood!!!! It’s not too greasy and you can use it in hot and humid air.
Sifr Aromatics,5,"Pleasantly surprised to know that such a shop existed in Singapore. All of fragrance to choose from, and even the option to customise. Price is reasonable since it is a tailored experience."
Sifr Aromatics,5,This is a fantastic and high class perfume store. It is  owned by a family from generation to generation. The smell is gorgeous and great. I bought Tea Sage perfume. You can make a reservation for making a personal perfume. This procedure would take around two hours. Try and enjoy the fragrance of nature.
Sifr Aromatics,5,Amazing fragrance shop. To be experienced!
Sifr Aromatics,5,"Fantastic scents handmade and mixed to
your liking ..... prices are reasonable for personalized fragrances"
Sifr Aromatics,5,"I was served by a beautiful lady name Lizzie .Her service is good. She prepared a unique mint diffuser for me and it refreshed my mind, soul and body. I like the way she smile and her hand gestures make me feel magical. Chewing gum is banned in 1992, if I cannot chew it then let me smell it in Singapore."
Prime Aces Limousine,5,"We have Prime Aces Limousine to handle our transfers when we were in Singapore. They are punctual, always on time and sometimes arrived earlier then the guests. They are very professional especially when handling very high profile personal. They provided us clean vehicles, polite and friendly drivers with a reasonable price. We will definitely choose this company again in the near future."
Prime Aces Limousine,5,"Private Limousine Services from @primeaceslimousine Fantastic Service! They replied and confirmed the booking so quickly! Luxury car and the driver was extremely friendly, professional and welcoming! The car arrived on time at the pickup location. I highly recommend this affordable service as it was fantastic!"
Prime Aces Limousine,5,I had such a pleasant experience journeying in Prime Aces Limousine the past weekend! Mr Sersin (our driver) was a safe and friendly driver! He was very knowledgeable about the roads in Singapore and we reached our locations without any delay.
Prime Aces Limousine,5,"I would engage PAL's services whenever my car is due for regular maintenance. Be it taking Lawrence's limousine for appointments or simply to run errands, it's a pleasure to be seated in his clean and comfortable ride. With Lawrence's credibility and dedication, he ensures that his customers are well cared of in all aspects. Keep up the good work !"
Prime Aces Limousine,5,"Superb, top-notch service with high professionalism. If you are looking for high quality service while enjoying the luxury and comfort, Prime Aces Limousine is definitely the one you should go for!  Lawrence and his team are friendly, approachable and you don't get to experience such warmth often in SG >_<"
Prime Aces Limousine,5,The driver is never late and always on time to pick us up. He was very patient with us and very professional with his work. I love the comfort of the bus and I felt really safe too.
Prime Aces Limousine,5,"Being  professional in delivering service in this line is greatly expected and Prime Aces did just that.  Punctual and always keeping the  priority a priority, making daily plan smooth and well. Thank you for providing more than just service,  but a peace of mind.  Thanks Lawrence for the arrangement and Mr Goh Boon Hong for your service."
Prime Aces Limousine,5,Engaged service since 2017. Professional and excellent service.  Always on time....always earlier than me when picking me up. Top notch driving. Smooth journey.
House of Tan Teng Niah,5,A beautiful place to photograph especially when the sun is out the bright colors and the windows make some interesting compositions the building is getting old and some of the paint is fading but still the beauty remains.
House of Tan Teng Niah,4,"Visited in March before the lockdown. This house used to belong to Tan Teng Niah, a Chinese businessman who lived in what is now the Little India neighbourhood. While some of the architecture of the building retains Chinese elements, the restoration has given the building a very colourful scheme, which looks more South Indian than Chinese. It’s a very photogenic building, nevertheless."
House of Tan Teng Niah,5,"One of the hidden colorful gems in Singapore! The perfect photography spot!

Always a good vibes and memories are coming from there!

IF you are fan of street photography graffiti or history of Singapore then you are going to love it! remember it!

Cheers!"
House of Tan Teng Niah,4,"I would say this place is interesting. It doesn't offer magical or amazing attraction, but the very colorful old Chinese house in the middle of India district in Singapore is really unique. The residence of Tan Teng Niah will give tourists happy vibes. We can take photos here and continue sight seeing Little India area or eat some Indian food which located next to the residence. The best time to come here is at morning until before afternoon."
House of Tan Teng Niah,5,"Little India it's amazing, I joined the indo festival..very nice. I love Indian food 😋"
House of Tan Teng Niah,5,"Known as one of Singapore iconic building, nothing special. We didn't enter, just taking pictures outside the bulding.
Still it has nice color"
House of Tan Teng Niah,4,"A small, quaint building with beautifully arranged colors. The street corners around Tan Teng Niah are not very clean, and sometimes filled with trash when the garbage trucks are late. As with any popular tourist-y place, go early to avoid the crowd and the humidity!"
House of Tan Teng Niah,4,"1st time visiting Little India after 40+ years of living in Singapore.  After our recent interest with murals in Singapore, decided to go for a quick look and am glad I was not disappointed! The pictures speaks for itself. :)"
The Dive Company,5,"I just got my open water certificate with The Dive Company and the experience was superb. I believe the most important part of courses like this is the instructor. Rafi was practical, encouraging, and most important of all, fun to be with! Definitely recommend to those who are looking to getting certified and joining the diving community."
The Dive Company,5,Thanks for to Rafi and team for getting my 10 year old son certified. A fantastic experience start to finish. Looking forward to diving with you again soon ;-)
The Dive Company,5,"An all-round wonderful experience with the Dive Company; with Rafi, the course was a breeze and completely enjoyable. Looking forward to future dives together!"
The Dive Company,5,"Easy booking process, constant updates and clear information. Engaging, patient and supportive instructor - what a great experience!"
The Dive Company,5,Great place to learn diving. With qualified and competent instructors! Great experience.
The Dive Company,5,"If there were 10 stars, I'd give Rafi and TDC 10. I had only done 4-5 discovery dives many years ago before I finally plucked up the courage to do my OW certification. Right from contacting Rafi, I received a stream of e-learning materials, emails, and instructions, following which I did my confined water training in a swimming pool and 4 OW dives at Pulau Hantu. Rafi's teaching was clear, kind, structured, and complete. I felt 100% at ease just because of how confident he made me feel, and helped me get the basic equipment I needed (a velcro/neoprene strap for my mask) to address the only issue I faced (my hair being tangled in the strap of my mask). Despite the low visibility and strong currents in Singapore's waters, I always felt safe and at ease. I went on to do my AOW course with Rafi and have done almost 20 dives in the last 2 months. Rafi is a great vibe personified, he is kind, compassionate, and friendly to everyone he encounters, and he imbibes the spirit of the ocean through and through. There is no one else I'd recommend to learn diving from, and I'd happily dive every dive with him and his team forever and a day."
The Dive Company,5,Just completed a PADI Bubblemaker with my young son.  The Dive Company were really helpful arranging a slot despite the various lockdown restrictions (thanks Rafi) and provided a wonderful teacher (Windy - just fantastic).  Equipment and rented pool were great (various pools are used) and we had a great time!
The Dive Company,5,"Enjoyed myself while on this course! Rafi is an amazing instructor - patient and experienced - felt very safe while diving with his guidance. Learnt a lot from his wisdom in diving and life! Cost wise, it is also one of the cheapest available in Singapore. Highly recommended! :-)"
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",5,Nice quiet peaceful Thai Buddhist Temple to seek for blessings. The temple personnel are friendly and helpful.
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",5,"Historical off the beaten track temple with a statue of a massively tall Buddha! It’s worth a visit. Sadly, the sleeping Buddha was off limits during my visit."
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",5,"My first time to the temple. Very friendly staff who guided me through what is to be done, even pointing out the different relics behind the main hall. Take a peek at the hidden Sleeping Buddha. I almost missed it if not for the staff. Love the light inside. And to top it off, it is part of the Little India heritage trail. Mix of Chinese, Thai and Indian Buddhism. Be prepared to remove shoes though. Big like and gratitude!"
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",5,One of the most peaceful place to be
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",4,"I missed the secret chamber (didn't know it was there), so only spent a few minutes here. I did like the animal statues and the giant Buddha, it's a bit of a different style than other temples. I wouldn't go way out of my way for this as a tourist."
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",4,"This is not a traditional Buddhist temple, it has more the appearance of a tourist spot.
You can buy offers, turn the wheel of Fortune and read about the history of the place.

Just behind the big Buddha, you will find the sleeping Buddha."
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",5,Lovely serene place..🙏☺️
"Temple of 1,000 Lights (Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya)",4,A nice buddha temple. Peaceful place for worshipping.
GOURMETbus,5,Love the cloud dome. Go during evening time to enjoy the day and night views of the domes and the surroundings! The light show at the super trees are also fun!
GOURMETbus,5,Made use of the SRV vouchers. Was a good experience although we were quite shocked that there was little crowd on a Friday. Went during the orchid showcase. Recommended to go on a weekday and remember to book a time slot to enter the different domes.
GOURMETbus,4,"Nice place. Go to both cloud forest and flower dome. Well worth it. Very pretty flowers. Quite picturesque if you want to take photos. Saw a wedding couple. 😊😊

Gift shop not great. Expensive and limited merchandise."
GOURMETbus,5,"I have been here. This is man-made. However, the natural beauty here is amazing. Wonderful. I went here in an international group when we attended a conference in Singapore. The atmosphere here is amazing. Everyone one is so happy and excited to be in this world famous garden. Singaporeans did this this project so perfectly it feels really natural here."
GOURMETbus,5,"I would recommend people to stay in the gardens as long as possible to see the trees under sunlight and at night. When it is cloudy, the view up at the skyway is very breathtaking as you can see all the clouds moving up there. The light shows at night are very amazing too. They play different musics every time, it was classical music during my first visit and for national day they played the national anthem. There are multiple gardens of different themes on the ground. It is not too tiring if you ride a bike from the gardens to the east coast park, the view alongside is good for this route."
GOURMETbus,5,"Amazing place. Loved it. Light show is amazing, lots of fun. Hope to visit again😘😘"
GOURMETbus,5,"A wonderful tourist attraction.
I am quite proud with the way they are maintaining this place even though it is phase 3. I see new exhibits every time I visit this place. It feels like something out of a book. I must say their exhibits are getting more advanced.
I feel bad that it is quite empty nowadays.
There are really good cafes and restaurants nearby.
Overall, a great place."
GOURMETbus,5,Nice place to go when you want to be a tourist instead of a regular citizen that is so used to everything Singapore can offer. Had such an amazing time with my mum there.
Kranji Marshes,5,"The place was easy to find. It was just beside Gallop Kranji Farm Resort.
Once you've parked, you can see Baya Weaver birds' nests in the reeds and if you stand for a while, you'll see the weaver birds flying to their nests. Further in, you can see a Pied Fantail in its cup-sized nest in the tree near the rest area.
There is so much to see here and there are hides and the raptor tower further in which gives you a good view of the surrounding area.
I would come back here again to see if I can spot more birds.

It is kid friendly too as my child was able to walk all the way in and up the tower and back. The whole trip took about an hour for us. Parking is very limited. There seems to be a shuttle bus service on weekends and public holidays which could help people get there, which is a great service for a public park."
Kranji Marshes,5,Tranquil and peaceful place to get away from the hectic city life. Fortunately it was very cooling after a heavy downpour just hours before we arrived. The air was very fresh and not much crowd.
Kranji Marshes,3,"Our first time to Kranji Marshes on a Monday afternoon to avoid crowds.  It was very quiet and peaceful trail at 4pm under the hot sun ☀️

Note: only bus to go there during weekdays is bus 925.

Going there during weekdays are quite inconvenient and inaccessible as walking will take you hours to arrive, so we took a taxi in.

The trail is very peaceful and quiet and it’s worth going if you are an avid bird lovers."
Kranji Marshes,3,"A small park suitable for a short walk or bird watching. The actual Marsh area is disappointingly small, and if just walking can be covered in less than 10 minutes. There is a long, paved road between the Carpark and the Marsh area. Unless you're lucky enough to spot a raptor, the car park will likely offer the closest up view of birds in the area, e.g. Golden-backed weavers."
Kranji Marshes,3,"Free:
Water
Parking
Toilet

Quite a nice view from the tower. And if one is more free spirited like me, stay under the shelter of the tower, its quite comfortable to enjoy the breeze and the area is clean enough for a forested area. Just help maintain the cleanliness."
Kranji Marshes,4,From entrance to attraction it’s a pretty boring 10-15min walk. Path is mostly not shaded so can be uncomfortable in a hot day. The raptor lookout tower is nice but the surrounding around can be explored within 15 min. Not particularly interesting but if you want to avoid crowd and do a <1H walk it can be done here.
Kranji Marshes,3,"Interesting 10 to15mins walk to the view tower and observation hut. Just a small area, can be explored in 15mins. Bring binoculars..."
Kranji Marshes,5,"Great outdoors venue, for walks, and especially great for birdwatching. Lots of butterflies in the morning. Dragonflies too!  Not crowded as it is not so accessible as public transport is limited there."
The Great Escape,5,"Love the chill vibe of this place! Buy a bottle of wine for SGD 40 (it comes with plastic glasses) and just sit anywhere you want for however long you want.
Lovely view, cheap alcohol, good music...what more do you want!
Great place to wind down after a movie at the Projector. Don't expect anything fancy or good quality with respect to the alcohol though."
The Great Escape,4,Good music and drinks...windy place
The Great Escape,4,The open air place \m/
The Great Escape,4,Fantastic chill out location for a drink on Friday evening to escape the crowds of the typical Club still area
The Great Escape,5,"Chill out in this rooftop bar away from the bustling city. Its location is secluded but definitely a relaxing spot to enjoy a cup of drink and chit chat with friends. What makes it more interesting, is the hippie decorations."
The Great Escape,5,"Electronic dance music, open air, view towards MBS"
The Great Escape,4,"good music, good vibes, good drinks"
The Great Escape,4,I think this place is quite awesome and so nice. I love the vibe and the feel of the place. It is located in a parking lot. It recently shut down! They had a 3 day long party for the closure! It is in the open and the music used to be quite awesome. I have enjoyed my time always around this place. It is quite awesome to be here. It feels like an underground scene in Singapore! They have another club near the washroom area of the building. Quite a cool place to hangout and party late night!
Lion Heartlanders,3,"I had a good time, and I learning some things about the Islamic society."
Lion Heartlanders,5,Awesome virtual tour experience that felt like I was present physically
Lion Heartlanders,5,Enjoyed the game and the tour of the Singapore River! Didn’t expect to be so fun over virtual too 😆
Lion Heartlanders,5,"First time experiencing a virtual tour, interesting & engaging."
Lion Heartlanders,5,I have participated in the tour and it was fun despite having it virtually !
Lion Heartlanders,5,Great way to learning more about the Singapore history....engaging and interactive!
Lion Heartlanders,5,Enjoy the tour. It was interactive and get to know something I don’t know about Singapore.
Lion Heartlanders,5,"The activity was educational, refreshing and nostalgic. It was AWESOME!"
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,Well maintain public pool.
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,Convenient place for exercise and refreshments.  Ample parking.  However male toilet and bathroom with opening that is slightly block by landscape which can see from neighbouring blocks.
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,Great place to spend a Saturday / Sunday morning with  your family. The Seng Kang Sports Centre for swimming is just located beside Anchorvale Community Centre and you can have lots of choices of activities for your kids after they have their swim. Pastamania and MacDonald's ( alwayss packed on weekends ) with a drive thru are the F&B options available.
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,"Go there for my weekly swim in the night. Relatively easy to obtain a slot if you are flexible in your schedule.  Not crowded, especially in the shower room, since there is restricted number of people allowed for each time slot."
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,"One of the Best swimming complex for kids in Singapore.
Got 2 big swimming pools and 3 to 4 small pools for kids.
Few slides to enjoy.
Lot of eateries around. Weekend gateway for kids and adults"
Sengkang Swimming Complex,5,Has both an outdoor and indoor pool! Awesome for a late morning or early afternoon swim without getting tanned.
Sengkang Swimming Complex,4,"One of the newest swimming complex. There are several pools to cater to all ages group.
There is a 50m competition pool, a sheltered learn to swimming pool, a water feature pool, a water slides and jacuzzi.
A cafe inside the complex that served beverage and food to cater to your hunger needs after a good workout!"
Sengkang Swimming Complex,3,"Decent size of pool with shelter and non-sheltered. There's also slides and other fun features for kids. The only problem is that you need an Ez-link card to enter, should have other ways of payment too."
Splash-N-Surf,5,"Splash & Surf is now open but make sure to make a booking in advance, 1 slot per pax make sure to book the exact number of persons.

They only accommodate 18 pax per hour.

We went CNY Eve , its just us. My toddler enjoy it so much."
Splash-N-Surf,5,"Kid had a ball of a time running around the wet playground. Staff are super friendly, especially towards the kids. Hopefully, they'll have more flexible rules during off peak hours to allow for more than one adult per child to enter"
Splash-N-Surf,5,Adorable free water playground for kids. Avoid really hot weather - there is no roof.
Splash-N-Surf,5,"Splash n surf is a good place to enjoy with younger kids located in the heart of national stadium. Kids water play area is amazing specially for kids up to 6 -7 years including 3 small rides, water canon , water fan , mushroom splash and  little swimming pool with depth of perhaps 0.6 Meter .  Lifeguards are  always there to take care of  kids.  Beside play area lazy river is a nice place to inculcate your laziness. Tube rental is available dirt cheap .  Five star for everything. Adults can also take chance on sting ray located nearby. Spectacular view of sea with skyscraper is amazing ."
Splash-N-Surf,5,Got this information about free admission at this splash n surf on google. Went there with kids and got amazed with all the facilities they gave although it is free. Recommend for all those with kids to bring them and have fun here.
Splash-N-Surf,5,Excellent place but.... don’t go in the afternoon. There are no cover so it’s super hot scorching.  Chlorine in the pool will sip into human skin and into our blood stream and may cause sickness to low immune child.  Preferably to play any water playground at a cooling area.
Splash-N-Surf,5,"Fun place to bring the kids.
Has a 0.6m play pool, lockers & lifeguard on standby."
Splash-N-Surf,5,Public kids waterpark - well maintained & clean 😍😍😍
Quayside Isle,4,Should be much more peaceful between 7am & 9am and 3pm & 5pm.
Quayside Isle,4,Nice chill vibe along the marina boardwalk. Lots of food options with great view of the boats at the marina. Lots of people walking and chilling with kids and pets.
Quayside Isle,5,"Place of full of vibrancy, waterfront restaurants have both alfresco and in-house dining options. Will need to make reservations in advance as the seats fill up pretty fast.
P/S: For public transport option, take free shuttle bus route B at Beach Station and alight at W Hotel Sentosa Hotel. After 10pm, do wait for the shuttle bus in front of Cold Storage which is located at Sentosa Cove Village, close proximity to Quayside Isle."
Quayside Isle,3,A lovely spot to stroll and boat watch and perhaps have a glimpse of the very rich. Quite a few restaurants to select from.
Quayside Isle,5,Quayside Isle offers a peaceful ambience rich in cultural diversity of food and drinks. The restaurants are located by waterfront with lovely verandahs. Each shop has its special food to offer. Each is unique in decor. Visitors have plenty of choices.
Quayside Isle,4,"There are many bar, cafe, restaurant and shops in Sentosa cove. Good view for Yacht and sea. Also it is nice to walk in dock and can see Yacht. Easy to access by free shuttle."
Quayside Isle,5,It's a nice place to chill and pretend that you own a place on the island (haha). Probably better to go sometime in the evening to people watch and feel time passing you by. There are a couple of great restaurants in the area as well if you want to spend a couple. There are also events held here from time to time so do look out for them!
Quayside Isle,4,"Nayy to the Aglio Olio,  Yayy to the minced beef!"
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"Enjoyed a distillery tour at Brass Lion - well worth it! Very informative tour and tasting afterwards, great professional and friendly team only to happy to share their passion for making Gin! Great venue with loads of cocktails and a nice comfortable bar area to enjoy!"
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"Attended the gin workshop. Absolutely fantastic . Get to know more about gin making. Trainer kino was great .. friendly and professional...
Ambience decor .. drinks are all fantastic"
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"Enjoyed the distillery tour very much. It’s led by Jamie the founder, and it’s evident how much passion she puts into the business and the process. Also enjoyed their cocktail variations at the bar"
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"The gin school is highly recommended. A lot of fun to do with a few friends. Learn all about gin and make your own bottle to take home from a huge range of botanicals/ingredients available in the very nice ""school room."""
Brass Lion Distillery,5,Amazing bar and distillery serving various type of gin based cocktail
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"Super tour ... Excellent guide ... Super tasting session🥂
I finally bought a bottle at the end, a bit expensive but quality is there and still lot of stuffs done manually and quality is there ! 👌
I really enjoyed it and recommend to all (above 18 😛) btw not necessarily to Gin lovers though 👍"
Brass Lion Distillery,4,"-Quiet place with its distinctive distillery vibes with its gin bottle deco by its main counter

-Gins are decent, with the happy hour Gins slightly more watered down than the cocktails section

-shame that while the oysters are good sized, they are frozen.

-overall a nice relaxing place for decent gin if you are in the area, as it is not the most convenient unless you drive."
Brass Lion Distillery,5,"Great food, fantastic place and good service. Fresh oysters pair with unique Gin = Amazing."
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,4,Good place to take pictures.
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,3,It's very beautiful art Momentum Sculpture
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,4,"One of the twelve public sculptures along the Marina Bay Art Trail in the CBD area. A kaleidoscopic pyramid made up of figures in painted steel holding hands. Created by David Gerstein, a well-known Israeli artist. Nearest MRT station is Raffles Place (Exit E or F)"
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,5,It's an interesting sculpture and beautiful
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,3,"A colorful sculpture of abstract people whirling up. Looks kinda appropriate for a business district. It was tall, I kinda like it, although I saw it from across the road."
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,5,"Incredible sculpture, I believe it reflects how Singapore is built by different races and living together in harmony.."
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,5,Beautiful !
Singapore Momentum Sculpture,3,"(Translated by Google) It's not mine, there are better options. Have seen it several times, did not blow us away.

The Bar at 15 Stamford,2,"Summary:

Excellent food and décor, undermined by the overall service experience.

Generally, I am forgiving of service standards in Singapore. We are a utilitarian people and for most establishments, passable, unoffensive service suffices and I can focus on enjoying the food. With finer establishments, the demands rise but even so I do not expect the same level of polish as compared to similar tiered restaurants in London, Paris or Tokyo. Despite that, my service experience at 15 Stamford and with Capitol Kempinski left much to be desired.

In summary, from the time of booking till the end of the meal, the service staff from the hotel and restaurant were uncoordinated, unempathetic, and patronising. Even my very forgiving companion started to get annoyed towards the end. It was my first time visiting the Kempinski brand and since my friends had generally had decent experiences, I was hoping to add this to my roster of regular places. But as good as the food is (and it really is good), I don’t think I can bear to have to deal with the service again.

[I wrote in with this feedback (3000+ words lol) to see how they would acknowledge the feedback (I do not want a voucher or something) but was quite disappointed to receive a response that was essentially templated, and that looked like placeholder terms weren't even replaced. The lack of care is almost insulting :( ]

The long story, for those who care, are in the images, because google reviews sadly has a character limit!

The food (and wine choices, as little as I actually got to try) are excellent, and so I cannot bear to give worse than 2 stars even though the service was a slap in the face. Nonetheless, this might be the lowest rating I've given any food establishment :(

Oh also, the wall had old dried lobster juice all over it, which wasn’t cleaned off…. Have pics of that."
The Bar at 15 Stamford,5,"I dined at this restaurant thinking that it serves peranakan food. Oh man, I was so wrong. It is a restaurant flat serves modern Asian fusion cuisine. I was mind-blown by a few of the dishes.

I highly recommend the following dishes amongst the ones that I tried:

1. Hirasama Kingfish
2. Yellowfin tuna akami
3. King Salmon
4. Charred cos lettuce - such a simple and yet refreshing taste
5. Foie gras kaya toast - mind-blown
6. Rotisserie chicken rice - overpriced chicken rice but it is very nice!
7. Laksa - slightly salty but tasty

As for the desserts, the concepts are too modern for my brain to digest them.

It is very pricey. After all it is located within Kempinski Hotel. They have set lunch which is much more affordable. I hope there are occasions for me to go back and try out the rest of the dishes on the menu."
The Bar at 15 Stamford,5,Great food and service. Worth trying. Highly recommended!
The Bar at 15 Stamford,5,My second visit after a year. It’s a beautiful place to have a leisurely meal and conversation away from the crowds. This time I had the bak ku teh ribs and I must say it’s as delicious - it has that bak ku the taste yet also tasted like char siew. My only wish is that the set menu would have new items and not the same as the previous year.
The Bar at 15 Stamford,3,"Food was nice but the service can be better given this is a hotel restaurant also. I am not sure if they are lack of staff but it seems they never attentive to customers. They also didn't explain the dish or even said the name of the dish. Just say 'fish', 'beef' one word.

However the food served hot and promptly. The kayak toast was interesting and has unique taste. The beef was the best dish of the night."
The Bar at 15 Stamford,5,Had great cocktails created by Francis and Timothy!! Just ask them for recommendation for the drink.
The Bar at 15 Stamford,3,"Spacious and beautiful decor..you feel you are in NYC. Service was attentive and personal. However, food wise can be improved. Lunch menu was limited. Kaya toast was underwhelming, could have a better pairing instead of foam. Spare ribs could be served with carbs? Dessert was simple and not that spectacular."
The Bar at 15 Stamford,5,"We thought their service was impeccable! Restaurant was a wee bit hard to find for a first timer, walked around but eventually located it.

Had to visit as it was one of the winners of Restaurant Week!

Menu as shown below.
I had the smoke trout - yummy
Angus beef char siew - oh so good! Melt in the mouth type
And dessert was Chargrilled banana

Added some pics of the mango sago with coconut ice cream that my friend had. Something different indeed!

Very nice fusion food set in a well spaced out restaurant. Place was full but we didn’t feel it at all. Great place to have dinner and a catch up with friends."
Singapore Polo Club,4,"Visually not much, but it does have an old colonial and aristocratic feel.
It has a small pool ( by Singapore standards) and a restaurant with very good food.
Home for many beautiful horses."
Singapore Polo Club,5,"Brought the kids to get them to appreciate horses. I must say very kids friendly and excellent service even to non members such as myself. Food abit pricey but members enjoy realli good discounts. Overall was a great experience, even provided towels with toilets kept clean. Highlights was definitely getting close to those horses."
Singapore Polo Club,5,"Non members welcome during weekdays. Have facilities like gym, pool, and of course stables to house the horses. Good and quiet place to have intimate meal with family or friends"
Singapore Polo Club,5,"Beautiful Polo club with colonial vintage settings and the club managed to retain many of the original design. You can sense a very warm and wonderful feeling while touring the club.

Had a good lunch with an ex colleague, who is a member of the club at the Paddock Bristo.

Hope to be able to be a member."
Singapore Polo Club,4,Was in the area needed a place to spend half an hour. Luckily the Polo club restaurant is open to non member from Monday to Friday. Food is so so but the view is nice.
Singapore Polo Club,3,"A nice place to chill out only during weekdays, weekends are reserved for members only."
Singapore Polo Club,5,Fabulous place to watch polo (til 630) on Tuesday and Thurs.   Service us attentive and menu is electric blend which a whole vegetarian menu as well.  Membership needed on weekends..
Singapore Polo Club,4,No better place on a hot afternoon with an ice cold drink to watch polo. Food is great. Love the atmosphere. Service is friendly.
Lake of Dreams,5,"This place is well decorated by artificial flower, tree& lights. We had a lots times spent in this nice place. Walking around 3-4 hour."
Lake of Dreams,4,"The entire place is nice and you will have lots of free things to see and food shops nearby. Depending on the season different decorations are displayed. Even if you won't visit a single paid attraction, you still can explore all this complex and be amazed by their creativity and the amount of energy and money invested in it."
Lake of Dreams,5,Very nice place to see and enjoy.
Lake of Dreams,4,"More like the central 'hub' of Sentosa, where all the action takes place. There are a couple of shows that occur not too far from this place (maybe at Waterfront, etc.). Always busy as expected. The entrance of Universal Studios is nearby, as well as several Casinos."
Lake of Dreams,4,"This is a relatively big water feature located at the resort world sentosa. Different design features at different point of the fountain, especially beautiful at night with the lightings."
Lake of Dreams,5,Very good place to hangout with friends and family.
Lake of Dreams,3,"Lake of Dreams in Singapore is located in Sentosa, being one of tourist attraction. It is just an ordinary fountain, without any special attraction. You can take a nice photo here, after that maybe you can go to Sentosa."
Lake of Dreams,4,This is a water feature fountain in the middle of Resorts World Sentosa. Located close to the entrance of Universal Studios. If you walk from here towards the Sentosa Merlion (currently being demolished 🙁) you get a nice view of the fountain  from the top of stairs and escalators. During COVID was drained and hopefully reopens soon if not already.
M&B Private Jewelers,5,"My fiancé got me a ring that I’ve always wanted! I’m so in love with this ring, everything about it was perfect! I came in with zero knowledge about diamonds, but after visiting M&B Private Jewelers, I know everything about it. Yarden was very nice and their service was top notch. It was a very smooth and pleasant transaction, I have no complaints at all. Extremely happy and satisfied!"
M&B Private Jewelers,5,"Mr. Mori was very friendly, responsive and offered the most straightforward advice, regardless of my budget. I’m a happy customer with my new pair of diamond and pearl earrings."
M&B Private Jewelers,5,"The nice ambiance makes you comfortable instantly. The services they provided were very accommodating, genuine, and answers all your queries with added info. I was very apprehensive as It was my first time customizing jewellery and I am so happy with the result! They made it so easy for me to decide and completely understood what I wanted. Highly recommend it. Will be visiting again!"
M&B Private Jewelers,5,Recently purchased an engagement ring from M&B. Overall really great and super easy experience even though I was purchasing from overseas. Roi was extremely patient in walking through the different options with me and answering the many questions I had on the ring or the process. Can't say enough about the fantastic service he provided. The ring arrived perfectly with no issues. Would highly recommend!!
M&B Private Jewelers,5,"At first I was so nervous about customising a ring but now I can't be more pleased with my decision! I just love how the light yellow stone gives the ring a perfect special sparkle! Mori is so knowledgeable yet patient. I can't wait for next opportunity to work on the next piece, earrings? 😁😁😁"
M&B Private Jewelers,5,Mori's customer service is impeccable! From extending the store's opening hours so that we could head over for a viewing at a time that was convenient for us to assessing the type of diamond that he felt was suitable for me. I'm really glad I chanced upon this store and I highly recommend M&B Jewelers.
M&B Private Jewelers,5,Very happy with my purchase. Mori was very knowledgeable and patient with me even though I do not have a big budget. Very professional and service was excellent. Will definitely recommend.
M&B Private Jewelers,5,"Great service and experience with Mori from M&B.

Went to M&B as I needed to get a ring done and I had a splendid experience. Mori and his team are super professional from the start to the end, explaining and communicating every step to ensure that I understand and know what is going on. I had a few iterations of design change but he saw to them quickly and professionally. I would highly recommend his service to anyone who is looking to get any diamond and jewelry."
Punggol Waterway Park,4,A fairly small park built around a waterway. Not many open spaces or dense trees - mostly flat walking paths and some seating areas by the waterside. May not be the best spot for bird photography due to the high human traffic and sparse trees
Punggol Waterway Park,5,"A great recreational space for exercise, picnics and other outdoor activities! And some areas offer picturesque views that make you feel like you're overseas, especially in the early morning and dusk.

If you're lucky enough, you can get really close to some beautiful species of birds. There's also a good balance of areas exposed to sunlight and shade, so there's always a shady place to rest that's not too far away."
Punggol Waterway Park,5,"Nice park for jogging, cycling or just to capture some photo"
Punggol Waterway Park,5,Was doing the coast to coast trail. This is one of the check point. The scenery is beautiful. Maybe it was late at night is very peaceful.  As you walk along the board walkr the structures reflected on the river is just so fantastic.
Punggol Waterway Park,3,"Greenery park
Suitable for a walk"
Punggol Waterway Park,5,The cycling path is excellent especially when it isn't crowded. The waterway though man-made looks natural enough. Nice relaxing atmosphere.
Punggol Waterway Park,5,"Beautiful place, plant that I pass by everyday, have colorful flowers n buds, if we care to stop n admire."
Punggol Waterway Park,5,Love punggol waterway.  Good place to spend time with family.

Bedok Mall,4,Shopping?Makan?Here is the best place to go!
Bedok Mall,5,"Amazing place to shop. There are many different stores selling and eye-popping variety of things.

Overall wonderful place to shop and eat."
Bedok Mall,5,"It was great and there are many places to visit and eat. However, I do suggest putting a POSB ATM machine in the bus interchange. Overall great experience 🙂😌"
Bedok Mall,5,"Great place with lots of F&b at the basement level. You can find quick bites and restaurants alike.
And if you need groceries. There is a NTUC finest with a huge selection for you to choose from fresh produce to dried good. There’s even a section that sticks organic produce. Thumbs up!"

Wanderlust Adventures,5,"It was a fun filled Saturday with my family out in the sea. My kids had so much fun, especially my 9yo son. All the sea activities were well planned and so many diff things to try! It was my first time maneuvering a speedboat. So scared n yet so excited!! My son ventured out on his own on this sea scooter. He couldn't be happier. The smile on his face makes everything worth it. Wanderlust has thoughtfully prepared life jackets for my kids. So they get to play in the sea safely. My 6yo girl was so scared to go into the sea initially,  but after watching how much fun his bro and I were having, she overcomed her fear n joined us. My son is already asking me when will we go again?!"
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"The day didn't start well with the horrid weather but staff was efficient in keeping us updated with regards to the wet weather plans. They were flexible in starting the tour an hour later to give us the most of the ""non-raining"" part of the evening. They were accommodative and very friendly with my 2 year-old. Super friendly and approachable staff. Thank you Captain Q, Chris and Raymond for the wonderful Sunday evening!"
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"It was an amazing experience for me and my best friend . We had a splendid time watching the exquisite view by sitting on the front of the yacht and letting the  gush of strong wind blow our faces. We also learnt a new skill which is fishing that was taught by the fishing instructors. The instructors also made us a sumptuous dinner to end our fun filled day. In short, it was definitely an unforgettable memory for us. Thank you guys❤️"
Wanderlust Adventures,3,"Gathered some friends and family out for a fun trip, and whoever catches a fish bigger than my feet got a price money from all parties contribution. the Evening was relaxing and enjoyable as we eat the freshes catch of the day.   Overall, we had fun laughing and eating, that's what life is all about."
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"We had a wonderful day out celebrating our son's birthday.  We caught 4 fish that we could eat (and several smaller ones that needed to be returned to the sea): 3 were cooked for us by the captain when we stopped on Lazarus Island, along with some shrimp and squid, and the biggest one we took home and had for dinner the next evening.  The team were very friendly and patient, especially as we broke several lines and lost a number of hooks and sinkers.  They provided plenty of equipment and bait!  If the weather is good, you are in the sun all day so come prepared with cream and hats and coverings."
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"Taking Wanderlust yacht charter is a pleasant one when I organise a course mates gathering on this year Feb.

Service crew and Captain were very pleasant, polite and take every measures to ensure our safety on boarding the yacht since this is first time we take yacht.

One of the service crew, Raymond very patient to teach us how to do fishing. Finally we got the catch and enjoy them at the Lazarus Island with a glass of red wine.

My course mates are very enjoy this yacht cruise in the afternoon, looking at the blue blue sky, feel the sea wind, look at the southen tip islands, what a wonderful day.

Wanderlust will be my preference for my next yacht trip."
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"I am not a sea person per se. However, this day trip with wanderlust changed my view completely. It was a smashing fun filled day with so many refreshing activities to do, like water trampoline, magic carpet, canoeing and so many others I don't even know the names. I was more of at lost which game to play first initially instead.

After finishing playing all the activities, we gathered inside the cabin. The 4 bedrooms are all fitted with a private toilet each too, where we can shower and get changed comfortably.

There is also a 3rd level where I can breathe in the salty air from the sea and enjoy a quiet conversation with my wife. The experience of looking at the sunset out at sea together, feeling the salty sea breeze on our faces while sipping on our red wine is beyond any words can describe.

Overall it was an immensely fun and memorable experience I never thought I would have (being someone who doesn't even like the sea before). Thank you Wanderlust Adventures so much for such a wonderful experience! I hope more people will get to know of the fun and memories that you guys are bringing to the world!"
Wanderlust Adventures,5,"Thank you to the Wanderlust team for the wonderful proposal evening experience! Despite the rain, the crew helped in the proposal set up and teardown, took photos and filmed us the whole entire evening, ensuring my partner and I have a once in a lifetime proposal experience. (Justin was literally filming the whole process with rain and sweat all over but still maintaining that stability and quality in filming!!!) We really appreciate the effort put in by the team (despite the weather challenges) and accomodating to our needs. They made us feel very comfortable and feels like a family to be around with. Food was delicious (specially prepared by captain chef), the boat is clean and the crew is super friendly and amazing! It was a rainy and gloomy night but thanks to them, we enjoyed ourselves and easily one of the best experience! The end to the night was a boat drive around MBS. Despite the choppy waters, the crew ensure we still get a view of the city in the safest possible route. Thank you Wanderlust crew for the memories (also editing our proposal day video and sending the photos and videos to us!!!) we can proudly tell our friends and families :)"
Coney Island Park,5,First time to Coney Island....best for hiking n morning walk. I really enjoy the nature❤️
Coney Island Park,2,"We really enjoy Coney Island, and it’s the best place to not feel like you’re in Singapore. Pine tree smell everywhere, it’s amazing.

However at the south entrance there is now a huge construction site, which covers about 1/3 the island. It’s loud, dusty and there’s only a single track around it, with a big wall. Date of completion for the construction is 2024. We’ve previously used the north entrance and thought to try the south; big mistake.

I’d recommend to anyone going to Coney Island over the next 3 years:

1) Use the north entrance only
2) Stay to the top half of the island to avoid the construction sounds, particularly if you have younger children with you."
Coney Island Park,3,Good for pleasant walk or ride in the weekend. rusty green path to the beach. Walkways and cycling pathways are adequate. Need to carry water bottle. Cycles can be rented 500m before the entrance. 2-3km ride. Can see pulau ubin from the beach. Try to spot the colorful parrots in the park connector. Need more improvement on facilities like providing more vending machines and rest rooms.
Coney Island Park,3,Park is full of green.  Nice place to hangout and watch sunset. Lake brings an Europe taste. However park is still under construction and no public transport. .
Coney Island Park,5,"Perfect for gravel biking, several beach stations, but don't expect too much"
Coney Island Park,5,"Thankful that they decide to keep this place as pristine and in natural state as possible. Gives a feeling of some untouched nature. Enjoyable for cycling or stroll, nice to discover the little pockets of green in this concrete jungle and basking in nature"
Coney Island Park,4,"Although popular on a sunday mid morning, there are some quiet spots to be found. Most people congregate around the small beaches along the west side of the island. East side is quieter.
Heard that there are a lot of sand flies but we were lucky, also we didn't linger on the beaches..."
Coney Island Park,4,"a nice place to be with nature. so many small and less crowded beaches inside you can sure cycle and relax there. Get a mountain bike or so as the roads are mostly sand and stones .
i liked beach c with a nice mangrove walk and a very shallow beach where a small stream joins in as well from the mangroves.
my fav cycling place so far"
Toko Aljunied,5,They have good quality stuff. The lady by the name  Wan was super friendly and helpful... love her to bits! She gave good recommendations as I'm a newbie to all these. Bought a few pieces there.
Toko Aljunied,1,"Honestly, this is the first and the last time i will go to Toko Aljunied. When we first went to the store and we’re just window shopping, the lady boss were very rude and told us that we have to buy something from their store if we want to window shop. Because to them, if we look and see their product, it means that you need to buy them! Also, their fabric is very expensive for something that is not that “exclusive” batik. Customer service is very bad! Boss wasn’t friendly at all! Very rude to the customers! We’re offended and disappointed by their worst service.  That will be the first and the last time I’m buying from TOKO ALJUNIED!"
Toko Aljunied,5,A place where you can find many variety of batiks! Staff is very knowledgeable in every types of batik. Also very helpful. Even got discount. I LIKE!
Toko Aljunied,5,Lovely nonya outfits!
Toko Aljunied,5,"Great place to buy batik in Singapore! Very helpful staff, excellent selection"
Toko Aljunied,5,"The owners are extremely helpful. It was my first time buying and wearing a sarong kebaya, and they patiently walked me through the entire process. They helped me find a matching sarong and kerosang (brooches for fastening the kebaya with) for the kebaya I chose, advised me on fit and colours that would look good on me, and even taught me how to tie my sarong and pin my kerosang. Thank you Mr and Mrs Aljunied!"
Toko Aljunied,5,gorgeous batik prints!
Toko Aljunied,4,Good costumer relations....they know their stuff!!
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,"Very nice lounge with showers, buffet food Nd drinks area. Good selection of mags."
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,Very good
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,"Quiet, maybe coz it is midnight. Good selection of booze at 2 corners, but no bartender. Shower room and WiFi, food is simple and kept replenished..."
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,Very nice lounge! Well staffed and well stocked. Higher quality food than most lounges.
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,"Great food, one of the best lounges I have been in."
Emirates First Class Lounge,4,"A very solid lounge, all in all. Great plane spotting location, ample power points, and a decent amount of space. The buffet is ok, alcohol selection is adequate, but it could use real coffee rather than the typical automated coffee setup. Nothing truly exceptional to make it memorable, but it's a fine place to spend a few minutes before a flight."
Emirates First Class Lounge,5,The usual Emirates lounge experience... I love it.
Emirates First Class Lounge,4,Nice Decent Lounge
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"Just passed by this temple while walking in Chinatown, but unfortunately did not try to enter. However, I was able to take a peek because the gate was open and it seemed interesting inside.
You are supposed to cover up and remove your footwear before entering whether you’re a visitor or a worshipper.
I am flattered to see this temple with such distinctive design, and will surely visit another time to see it for myself."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"many times visit this temple. need to take off your shoes and put on rack but recommend to carry along with you to avoided be stolen (happened to my friends). before join the area need to remove all socks and walk around with your bare foot. casual find cooked food, yellow bread *not sure for name but all tasty. all non-tourist really friendly and love to advise you to make sure you can pay respect correctly. pagoda decorated by god/goddess which give you strong and peaceful vibe."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,It's very nice Mariamman temple in china town Singapore. Very spacious and looks good.
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"We visited this Sacred Temple which is situated on South Bridge Road in the heart of Chinatown. It is rather difficult to miss with its ornate tower and it's tall street wall with statues of cows and a lion on top. Before entering the Temple, visitors are asked to remove their shoes. On entering the Temple we were struck by the vibrant coloured pillars and floral hanging decorations.The ceiling has been painted with colourful religious images and figures. Small, colourful, and beautiful worth a visit."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"I really liked this temple, it was my first ever visit in hindu and I am very happy I went inside, its beautiful.
Dont forget you need to take your shoes of and be quiet.
There is the wow factor so dont skip it when in Singapore!"
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,Beautiful place that gives you serenity and tranquility. Remember to wear clothes with sleeves and longer pants so that you don’t show too much skin when you visit the temple. This is a show of respect to the religion. The visit is free.
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"One of the oldest temple and since the day I was born it had been here. Over the years I had continuously taken photographs of it. I had went in to see the interiors. It is classic like most Hindu Temple. Once every year, there will be a celebration with procession and the highlight is walking over the fire. I guess that really challenge the faith in the individual and their commitment to their faith. The same fire walking is also the highlight of Antony Robins's motivational course held in huge auditorium good for thousands of people."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,An interesting temple to visit both from a cultural and visual sense. Very active with prays and rituals happening at many different locations. Significant from a historical perspective being one of the oldest Singapore Hindu temples.
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,Historical place. Pity did not get to visit the temple but was honoured to be invited to attend a wedding blessing and dinner there.
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"Even on a rainy day is a nice,  cost effective way to enjoy some sights in Singapore.  I was surprised to see the tower which is vibrant in the cover photo has lightened and tarnished due to pollution,  sun and rain exposure.  Still a must see to walk by and look in."
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,"Singapore’s oldest (1827's) Hindu temple is also one of the most popular temple to its proximity to Chinatown and its colorful exterior. Admission is free, though a donation is requested of those taking photographs. An annual fire-walking ceremony is held here every October or November."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"#SriMariammanTemple - Singapore : I love this temple, I got powerful and positive vibes here, very near to Chinatown MRT Station."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,Great place to visit!
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"This is a must visit Hindu temple in Singapore, located just around Chinatown area."
Sri Mariamman Temple,3,"Visited the Sri Mariamman Temple back in March before the lockdown. This  Hindu Temple located on Temple street in the heart of Chinatown. The outside is fairly typical South Indian style temple with a gopuram. It wasn’t that busy when I visited, which gave me an opportunity to wander around and take a good look inside. There isn’t much to see and it’s less decorated than say the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in Little India."
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,"One of the more relaxed place to visit. As a camera person, come in early hours for a nice backdrop of Singapore skyline. At noon, less opportunities to take great pictures.

They have a dress code here so don't wear shorts or dresses which exposes shoulders as they reserve the right to entry if the dress code isn't matching. Tbh I found them pretty relaxed but you don't want to go back from gate so."
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,Very nice place for an exotic experience of a different region which may not be very popular in some of your cities. Beautiful decorations and special atmosphere with warm welcome by the religious. They may offer you free rice and food at dinner time. You may look apparently special if you're Asian or white among the other religious who are mostly Indians here. Good experience if you're very open-minded to engage in a difference culture.
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,A beautiful and unique temple. A short visit is highly recommended. Just take off your shoes and walk inside
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"Nice place. China town, temple, pagoda, mosque and great place to walk and have drinks in nice pubs."
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,"Im not familiar with their culture or religious beliefs i just found it interesting to visit because of those printed ceiling, very unique design of the temple. Other than that i would be giving it 5 stars if i know the story behind those relics over the temples entrance door"
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,Ok singaporean checkinf
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"The Temple was beautiful and worth seeing if you are interested in different religious. When we were there, they were doing prayers and watching it was beautiful."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,Most culturally interesting temple we visited in Southeast Asia. Architecture and detail is incredible. The nextdoor Chinatown also a special experience. Definitely recommend for any tourist trip to Singapore.
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"This temple makes impress to me. The gate is so amending, encourage to enter. Inside you will find a lot of interesting wall paintings. What made an impression on me is skyscrapers in background. You have to visit this place in Singapore."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,Visit during Pooja time you feel pleasant and peaceful...stress free
Sri Mariamman Temple,4,"Hindu temple inside china town, beautifully constructed,have dress code,can't visit wearing shorts,Bermuda or short skirts or bare shoulder."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,We had a quick stopover and was quite interesting for us as Tamils to visit Singapore and experience authentic tamil hindu temples!
Sri Mariamman Temple,3,Colourful Hindu Temple. Leave footwear at the entrance - don't carry around with you or you'll be told off
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,"Very surprised to find a magnificent Sri Mariamman Temple in the middle of Chinatown. Nevertheless, breathtaking and very beautiful."
Sri Mariamman Temple,5,Beautiful place to visit to get an Indian touch in Singapore
Indian National Army Monument,4,"It's a monument to honour the brave INA soldiers who fought for Indian Freedom,for few they were on wrong side but in the end they had given their life for Indian freedom.Thanks Singapore government for reconstructing this when britishers destroyed it after recapturing of Singapore after war.
Situated at esplanade park,easy to find, Indians visiting Singapore should must visit this place to pay respect to Netaji and brave soldiers."
Indian National Army Monument,5,The Former Indian National Army Monument is a historical site and a demolished war memorial at the Esplanade Park located at Connaught Drive within the downtown of Singapore.
Indian National Army Monument,4,Nice place to relax and take photo with background city view and playground
Indian National Army Monument,5,"The INA memorial marker marks the place where the orignal Indian National Army memorial stood which was constructed on the orders of the great Indian  Leader Subhash Chandra Bose,who was  the leader of the INA,

The orignal monument was destroyed in 1945.

This marker was erected in 1995,and is very close to the merlion statue,you can go walking from there   and reach in 10 -15 mins,

Its a must visit for any patriotic Indian and history enthusiasts who wants to visit the place where once the orignal INA memorial stood."
Indian National Army Monument,5,"Nice installation reminding  people of the sacrifices of the Indian National Army (INA) and the principles of Ittefaq  (Unity) , Itmad (Faith) and Kurbani (Sacrifice )"
Indian National Army Monument,5,Lovely place for those who want to spend some time with history
Indian National Army Monument,5,"As Indian do carry a flower when u visit the place it deserves that respect. Must visit, adjacent to country's war memorial. Use maps to locate it, else it's difficult to find and local folks don't know abt it. Very small memorial but loved it.
- Jai Hind"
Indian National Army Monument,5,The place should be a place of attraction st Singapore.
Masjid Abdul Gafoor,4,"Was built in 1859, this masjid have  special architecture which hold  one of Singapore's national monuments. It has mix mélange of styles – a mix of Southern Indian, Moghul and Europeans influences.  Located in the Central part of Singapore, it has since been redeveloped (re-opened in 1998)."
Masjid Abdul Gafoor,5,"Alhamdullilah. This is a really historic mosque in Little India, a stone’s throw away from Rochor MRT. It is meant primarily for the Tamil community around the area, but what is Islam if not for inclusivity? I highly recommend an experience to perform your prayers here and appreciate the different cultures that make up the beautiful religion.

Parking is the only toughie. If you can’t find streetside parking, there is a dedicated parking lot facility along Dickson Rd."

Masjid Abdul Gafoor,5,"Abdul Gafoor Mosque is one of Singapore's National Treasures. It is gazetted as a protected national monument in 1979.
In the early years up to 1980s, it was called the Dunlop Street Mosque.
It's a very beautiful Mosque though small. Very intricate in its architecture and design. Definitely worth a visit. However part of the mosque is undergoing renovation and you may not get the best photos you want of this place."
Masjid Abdul Gafoor,5,"One of historical mosque located at historical area. If you visit in the specially Ramadan month you will see the beauty of this mosque. Hundreds of fasting people spend their time with zikir and prayer inside mosque. Many muslims company donated Iftar Everyday for the fasting Muslim. Recently they have taken an initiative to do some renovation of this historical mosque like extend ablution area, extend prayer zone etc. A must visit place if you are geographical lover."

Masjid Abdul Gafoor,5,"An interesting mosque blending the Gujarati and Arabic architecture. Went for Friday prayer here, the main prayer hall is air conditioned and has plenty of fans. Preach was delivered in Gujarati/South Indian language."
Seletar Country Club,4,"Had a delicious meal at the Terrace. Enjoy your meals with the vista of the Reservoir, the green and the blossoming trumpet trees"
Seletar Country Club,5,"Beautiful place with a sizeable golf course. Came here for a wedding solemnisation and thought the view was lovely. The only not so good thing is that it’s rather far from  everywhere else. So other than golf, I am not sure why one will come here. But still full marks for the view and the people who work there"
Seletar Country Club,3,"Seletar Terrace
Went for dinner.  The place was packed with diners, since it was s Saturday.  Used to go there every Sunday before the Circuit Breaker period.
First visit after reopening of Phase 3.
They have replaced the tables and chairs with new ones.
Food was fine with large serving, meant for two instead of one.
We finished our main courses at about 8.40pm.  We placed our orders slightly before 8.00pm.  But two of our side orders did not surfaced.  People were seem enjoying their satay and rojak but ours were given a miss.
We waiting until 9.20pm and decided to call it a day.
We request for cancellation of the two side orders."
Seletar Country Club,5,"Great food, nice service, beautiful scenery. Love it"
Seletar Country Club,4,"We played amidst the major renovations going on. Should easily hit 5 stars rating once the renovations are fully completed. Play was very pleasant, and challenge are posed when playing off the various tees. Greens were a little slow. Sand bunkers are strategically placed, guarding the greens. Star of the golf course is a Grey Crowned Crane. Nice F & B at the golfers terrace."
Seletar Country Club,4,love the food here. wadeh and satays r great post-run food. staff are friendly; ambience is quiet and relaxing. good for a chill out session with buddies!
Seletar Country Club,2,The price does not justify for the quality of the food especially for non members. Maybe appealing for members using its facility to grab a quick bite but definitely I wouldn’t travel here to eat. Not worth the effort or money as they serve hawker standard food but charge at least double the price
Seletar Country Club,3,A very nice landscape country club. A nice Chinese  restaurant opened to the public on the second floor.
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Awesome place to party! Great food, drinks and live entertainment. Attractively cheap and hard to beat prices with 50% discounts on food and drinks daily. Very young and vibrant crowd. FOC Free flow alcohol for Ladies every Wednesday! Huge level 1 hall with unobstructed views to a large wide stage. Live band plays Mandarin, English, Korean, Cantonese Pop, retro and top 40s. Very creative and energetic team of artistes performs every night with an elaborate theme event monthly. Great place to hold corporate events too! Level 2 features a restaurant, darts lounge and KTV bar. The lobby area has got 2 pong machines for the enthusiastic beer pong lovers."
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Good place to enjoy live music, both Chinese n Cantonese. The band is good, Full of energy!  The ambience is amazing.
Were there on ladies night, and tables were all taken up.
Recommend to make rsvn beforehand to get the best seats. Highly recommended!"
Shanghai Dolly,4,nice place for chatting with friend or business activities
Shanghai Dolly,4,"Great place to chill. I love the Cantonese room, where there is some live Cantonese music. The bigger stage area is pretty good, depending on the shows available. But different themes for every night there.

A pretty cool place. Mainly full of local Asians rather than tourists due to the cover charge and unique experiences it presents."
Shanghai Dolly,4,It is a nice place with good singers and nice music systems
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Pleasant surprises behind that name. A hidden treasure of good food without burning a hole in your pocket. Take a pick of chilling out in a sports bar, karaoke, or immerse in the high energy of live performances. Wonderful friendly staff too!"
Shanghai Dolly,5,Great entertainment place. Live band performance is of high standards. Good service. Value for money. Secret restaurant on level 2 surprised us with tasty food too.

Shanghai Dolly,5,"Keyboardist great!
Manager zack is a very fantastic person. He will attend to your needs asap and is very understand when my friend is drunk. He even volunteer to take care of my friend. 10/10 will come back 👍🏻👍🏻"
Shanghai Dolly,5,"An excellent place to entertain and be entertained! The food is delicious, the service is impeccable and the show is marvelous. Cannot wait to have my next visit!"
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Nice place, a mixture of eastern and western music for party and chill out. Beverage pricing, most of their promotion were quite attractive. Cheers!"
Shanghai Dolly,1,"Stay away from this place, overly priced, crowded and no service mentality whatsoever (just horrible and impolite staff).
Me and my friends will never step there ever again, I suggest the same for others."
Shanghai Dolly,4,"Attractive promotions, with a good mix of mature and young crowd. Different spaces that caters to different entertainment needs. Do check it out if you're at Clarke Quay."
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Love going there,  that place cool..
And the ppl nice and friendly..
Love hear them sing too..."
Shanghai Dolly,1,"Went there to celebrate my friends’ Birthday. The dining room was really so squeezy and dimly lit. Service was slow and food was ordinary, nothing to crow about. Although the waiters attended to us at the beginning eg took our orders, they weren’t as attentive as the evening wore on. When it was time to bring out the cakes, the waiter wanted to know which cake was for whom. I pointed to our table and told him that one was for the ‘man in black and the other for the lady in white.’ Almost in a heartbeat, he blurted as he nodded, “Oh, that one huh? King Kong!”  I was too stunned to react. When he and his colleague brought the 2 cakes to the table, they joined in as we sang the birthday song but he had to add “Happy birthday to King Kong!” It was a good thing that my friend has a sense of humour although the expression on his face said otherwise.

So long story short, I recommend Shanghai Dolly as a last resort to anyone but it’s the first and last visit for me."
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Perfect place for a night of music and drinks, the food at Shanghai Dolly is also a highlight. The open singing concept at Wanbao Karaoke Bar also packs a whole load of fun!"
Shanghai Dolly,1,"Went to Shanghai Dolly with friends for a birthday celebration. This place is terrible. We order 2 towers of beer which cost us SGD$310.00 comparing with other pubs i went...Shanghai Dolly beer is very costly.

The Chinese 'LIVE' band performance is Tooooooooooo long........ I can snooze off while waiting for the disco the start. This is terrible. I will not visit this place again. BAD!!!"
Shanghai Dolly,4,The place was well designed where every patrons has a good view of the stage performance. Nice place to chillax and have a beer with your friends after a hard day work.
Shanghai Dolly,5,"One of the best places to chill out or party hard throughout the night, - to the live performances of the talented artistes, or DJ Kzee / DJ Jenzen spinning all night long!"
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Best hidden restaurant that you never know about!! Their must try are like satay, carrot cake, and pig stomach soup! Even my homecook pig stomach soup is no match for theirs!!"
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Great place to chill with good music and food, fall in love with this place ever since i step into it."
Shanghai Dolly,5,Fantastic place to hang out. Elegant with excellent service.
Shanghai Dolly,5,Been there regularly on Friday nights for the past 8 years and still loving it..
Shanghai Dolly,5,Great atmosphere. Great food. Great entertaiment. Great staff.
Shanghai Dolly,5,It's an awesome place for any occasion and the food on level 2 is great as well!!!
Shanghai Dolly,2,Age of clubbers are older compare to other club. Songs played by dj is abit old. Sound system is good and price are reasonable.
Shanghai Dolly,3,The price after happy hour ends is too expensive. Other higher end clubs have cheaper rates.
Shanghai Dolly,4,"Great food at level 2 dolly kitchen. Their Mala, huatiao bee hoon, tomato egg, XO carrot cake and sesame oil chicken is 1 of the best, with the company of music and cosy ambience at a very reasonable price, esp during happy hours."
Shanghai Dolly,4,"Great water hole, established entertainment outlet with canto pop and pop songs live."
Shanghai Dolly,3,"went there on 30sept2017. first time. close to $500 for 2x vsop, to me it's pricey. performance is lacklustre, the singers have dead pan look, although singing and band is ok, albeit some misses. for an entertainment club, it doesn't live up to the hype. would not recommend if looking for a fun place or checking on chio bu."
Shanghai Dolly,4,Nice music. Friendly staff. Good ambience
Shanghai Dolly,1,"A friend suggested we go to Shanghai Dolly last Friday 9th Dec 2016 as they are having this promotion -
""Festive Pints Promotion. $18++ for 3. But when I went there it wasn't a Pint for Tiger Beer. You only get half a pint. Talk about false advertising. In any case as we were already there we decided to stay.  I decided to order an extra set of their 3 Tigers and I was given coupons when I paid for it. So basically they give you 3 coupons for the 3 Beers when you order and after paying for it. Sometime later around 9.15pm I produced my coupon to the Bartender and he suddenly tells me - 'No cannot already. Pass 9pm"". For the record we were seated by the Bar. Right infornt of all the Bartenders. There are no signs. There are no indications that informs patrons about the ""9pm"" cut off time. No announcements from the DJays. Nothing. I asked to speak to the supervisor and I told him it's just 2 Beers and his reply was simply -""you want me to pay from my own pocket ah"". I decided it's a waste of time taking to anyone there over this as I was not going to be getting any help whatsoever. I paid for my drinks and now I can't have them. Isn't this cheating? And also for the record I did write in about this incident to the Shanghai Dolly management and I have yet to receive any reply or response."
Shanghai Dolly,4,"2 levels of entertainment, 2 different crowds. Level 1 for the younger (or young at heart) set, live band belting popular songs ranging from Canto to Kpop between dj sets.  Level 2 for the more mellow, live acoustic band and easy listening.

AND despite what others say, SERVICE IS GOOD - BECAUSE WE TREAT THE STAFF WITH RESPECT.  It is afterall, a club  - lousy drunks with crappy behavior shouldn't expect good service."
Shanghai Dolly,4,Nice place to chill out with live band playing Mandopop and Cantopop songs.
Shanghai Dolly,4,Affordable drinks and food. Good music
Shanghai Dolly,2,A really special atmosphere with a huge space and some live singers in the middle of the club on a massive scene but nothing memorable
Shanghai Dolly,4,Nice ambience for a chill n live music.   Open till early morning n quite crowded on wkend.
Shanghai Dolly,5,Great singing. Love the performance lineup.
Shanghai Dolly,5,Awesome party atmosphere with absolutely insane vibes! Must Go!
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Fantastic live Mandropop, K-Pop Band and Trance music"
Shanghai Dolly,5,Good ambience great live band and music.
Shanghai Dolly,2,Boring place with a lot of empty tables even on a Saturday night. I guess its heyday is over.
Shanghai Dolly,5,Great experience and a must go for any visitors!
Shanghai Dolly,2,Average Songs. Above Average adult crowd.
Shanghai Dolly,4,Nice atmosphere
Shanghai Dolly,3,For older crowd. Mixture of mandarin n english songs. Live singing group as well.
Shanghai Dolly,5,Great place for a mando pop party!
Shanghai Dolly,5,Fabulous Food and Music!
Shanghai Dolly,5,"Great place, great music and very safe!"
Shanghai Dolly,3,Watch out for their ladies' night deal. Only your first drink is free :(
The Single Cask,5,Cozy and hidden gem. Wide range of whiskies that you will be spoiled for choices.
The Single Cask,5,"beautiful place, amazing company, lovely whiskey. worthy to be called a second home."
The Single Cask,5,"The single cask is a fantastic little whisky bar if you're a fan of single malts. The servers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.

I can't remember the last time a bar in Singapore that had the vibes of cool bars in Europe, Hong Kong, or NYC.

It's not for someone on a budget but it's worth it for the experience."
The Single Cask,5,"I love the passion and excitement that the owners have and that showcases in the expansive selection, great service, how they make the effort to explain all the different whisky's they are bringing to the market. It's not your typical whisky bar where you walk in to get the mainstream whisky labels but if you are open to try something new, niche then let the owners walk you through the selection they have and believe you will walk out with trying something new."
The Single Cask,5,Lovely cozy place for a nice tasting with friend
The Single Cask,5,"I always have a great time here. It’s those one of the kind places that you would be back again and again.

Cosy ambience, delicious whiskies with excellent service, what’s not to like? 👍🏻

Look for:
▫️Brendan & YX for EPIC whisky recommendations
▫️Wei De for interesting cocktails
▫️Darius for food perfection"
The Single Cask,5,"small and intimate, it is like walking into your friend’s home and having him pull a favorite bottle to share. a little expensive, but for the age and quality of the list it is very fair. it is also reflective of singapore’s alcohol tax.

the staff is extremely friendly and knows their stuff.

update march 3, 2021:  this place is just plain, comforting."
The Single Cask,5,Always amazing - if you're lucky - there might be a single malt brownie on the menu! Great team - small space and awesome vibe - incredible whisky selection!
Poppy Fabric,5,"Nice People, good quality and very good service."

Xi Yuan Foot Spa,1,"I had visited this place few times and it's always been great with the men and the ladies. Today I was given some lady called Loffa ( not Chinese) and it was a VERY bad experience. She was yawning and didn't even put in any effort to press. She's like touching the toes and not giving a proper massage. Told her to put in more effort (even though I'm already someone who is afraid of pain) , but she was plain lazy. It was more touching then anything. Please do NOT use her if you are allocated her. Waste of money."
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,5,"My wife and I just got a massage from here. They took us right in, gave us a choice of male or female (which we didn’t mind either way). The massage was really good, prices were reasonable and place was clean. Overall had a great experience. FYI - google shows the place a little off from here it actually is - my tip is to take note of the address instead, get on that street then look for the number"
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,3,"I was so disappointed with the service. I came in at almost 9pm and asked for 45 mins of foot  reflexology for me and my friend. The cashier insisted that we could only do the 1 hour one despite having a 45 mins one on the menu. She claimed that they only do 45 mins foot reflexology in the afternoon. They do have different prices for massage deals in the afternoon and non peak periods which are pretty good actually. But there was no mention of 45 mins foot reflexology only in the afternoon. We didn’t make a deal out of it and just agreed for 1 hour foot reflexology.

We were asked to soak our legs in the herbal bath. The water was piping hot. The masseuse did not even bother to ask if the temperature of the water was alright. We had to waddle our feet in and out of the water in an effort to get used to the temperature while also allowing time for the water to cool down. But alas, less than 3 mins later the masseuse came back to take the tub away. Just when we were getting our feet adjusted to the water.

Foot reflexology on the whole was mediocre. The lady gave the impression that she just wanted to get her job over and done with. Reflexology on left and right leg was not consistent. Did not work on my spots at all. She was sulking throughout the 1 hour.

A white guy walked in. He was asked very politely how long would he like for his foot reflexology. Did not insist on him to take the 1 hour one like how the cashier did for me. Double standards, clearly.

The final act that ticked me off to write this review was when she pulled away the towel that she had on my lap during the reflexology. I was wearing a dress and the towel was to cover me. She just pulled it away with force while I was still wearing my shoes. Hello? Why the hurry? She could have waited for me to finish wearing my shoes and then take it back from me after I’ve adjusted my dress. She folded it back and put it together with other neatly folded towels. I’m not sure if it is to reuse on other patrons. But I would hate to think that way during Covid. That towel should go into the wash or be sanitised.

I did see a few other ladies who appeared to be more friendly and cheerful though. I guess it’s your luck on who you will get on that day."
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,5,"Nice place with affordable price. I will be back. A Vietnamese lady massaged me, her skill was very very very super nice. 강추"
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,1,"First time visited Xiyuan and its a horrendous experience.
Went to the Pahang outlet yesterday around 11 plus 12am and got my back and chest injured and seriousdizziness because of a male masseur who doesn’t know how to apply the right technique of massage, all he does was applying brutal force on my body throughout the 60mins of massage. Im very sure he doesn’t even know the right place and point for the massage, resulted in hurting my entire body. And for quite a few times i asked him to reduce his pressure because i was in great pain but i was basically ignored. He kind of like strangling my neck and pressing on the side of my wind pipe and when i asked him to stop, he asked if im in pain. I told him yes and all he could replied was “of course its pain, your shoulder and neck is aching” and he continues.
If my back pain and dizziness persist, i will not hesitate to take legal action."
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,5,"Massage here is superb! One of the best. Wang Ling massaged me, she’s strong and she knows the right points to press. No frills, no hard sell and simple place. Price is worth it."
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,5,"Finally a good and affordable foot massage.
It was between foot massage and reflexology (not painful), I went with a Friend and both our masseuses were qualified. It left us rested.
The salon was peaceful and quiet and clean, the masseuses didn’t speak amongst them.
Affordable price, possibility of combo (to tell before the massage start like 1h foot and 30min body).
Recommended"
Xi Yuan Foot Spa,5,"Great service! My first time here and i will definitely be coming back here again the next time. Staff and friendly, the masseur can see is experienced and know where to press. Price is reasonable too! 👍🏻"
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,1,"I usually don't leave reviews, but I felt compelled after the poor service I received. The business model is built around the tourist with a quick turn around so the tailors are not held accountable for the quality of their work. I strongly recommend choosing an alternative tailor in the area; at the very least, it can't be any worse."
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,"My experience here was simply amazing. Michael has an extensive knowledge on anything and everything to do with suit making and what impressed me the most was his keen eye for detail and recommending exactly what fits you the best.

The workmanship on the suit was absolutely wonderful, it exceeded my expectations on what I imagined it to look like. I highly recommend coming here to get a suit or a shirt tailored to your needs, you definitely will not regret it!

Will definitely come back again (:"
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,"Good Tailor very fast and efficient, if I could give them a higher rating I would.
Needed a suit for work and my work starts in a week. Very pleased as they made sure the fit was right before giving it to me and it was in time for my new job
THANK YOU!"
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,"Excellent experience. High quality material, excellent taste and advice, kind reception, good price. They'll make you look good for a reasonable price."
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,4,"Nice guys, pleasant and straight forward to deal with. My shirts were reasonably priced and well cut. The fabric selection is very good. As with any tailor, be very clear about what you want, check that they have properly recorded your request. When you receive the shirts, check them carefully at the store to see that they have completed your order as specified. There was a slight mix up in my order there and I am not sure where the process went wrong but they were very good about rectifying the problem while minimizing my inconvenience. I would use them again as the shifts fitted well without further adjustment. I would give them five stars if not the problem that I had, and I suspect I won't have that problem again."
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,Amazing fitting. Quick delivery. Have been getting my clothes done from here since the last 10 years and have never had any complaint either with the service or the fitting.
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,Prem was incredibly respecful of my wishes and was not pushy at any point. His attention to detail was so impressive and his suggestons were all on point. I highly recommend Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors.
Christian Armani Ladies & Gents Tailors,5,"Love this place, I am always really well received, fabrics are really good quality, all suits and shirts I have bought are well tailored and comfortable. Unlikely I will buy suits anywhere else. I would put more stars if I could."
Marina South Ferries,5,"We had a last min plan of going to St John island. The person on phone was courteous, knowledgeable and to the point. We reached a touch early, and they got us on an earlier ferry. That saved us an hour.

The ferry was smaller one, but fun. All open, and the crew (an old uncle for driver and one more guy) was chilled out. Back on time again. Enjoyed the trip."
Marina South Ferries,5,"Had a very pleasant trip today to St John’s.
Was delighted that there were staff there to assist and help in the transfers especially in boarding

Had a little chat with the young boy and he was really informative and suggested some things to look out for while waiting for the ferry to arrive

10/10 Would return again with more friends and family"
Marina South Ferries,5,"Had a pleasant day out with my family
We spent most of our time at Lazarus, we were lucky that we could take the blue boats which are faster and they could drop us directly at lazarus as  compared to taking the normal ferry which drops us at St. john’s

The staff(a boy and girl) was really helpful at the jetty and they helped made sure we boarded the correct boat on time

Thank you so much Marina South Ferries"
Marina South Ferries,5,"Very professional, safe, reliable ferry services to Southern Islands!!!
After doing considerable research, we settled on Marina South Ferries to visit Kusu and St. John's (including Lazarus) Islands. We were not disappointed with our choice as the ferry was on time, comfortable and had good service standards. Their ferries has an open upper deck to enjoy the views of Singapore skyline etc and an air conditioned lower deck. The ferry looked newer compared to other ferries plying the route.

Some Tips:
- There are some stalls near the ferry ticket counter in Marina South Pier MRT station that sell water, juice cartons and also eco rice options (fried rice, bee hoon etc), so one need not carry all these items before hand.
- There is no option to buy food/water on any of these islands hence it is highly recommended to procure these items before you board the ferry.
- The ferries are very much on time, hence if you wish to travel between islands or get back to Marina South Pier, be on time at the respective pier.
- Highly recommend to carry an insect repellent."
Marina South Ferries,5,Very accommodating staff. Had a great time with the team transporting us to Lazarus Island and back to Marina South Pier
Marina South Ferries,5,"Visited Lazarus on the 4th July and had a pleasant experience with the staff.

My boyfriend was late as he had difficulties finding a parking lot that Sunday morning. As we were heading to Lazarus island, we had heavy bags with us and I was initially planning to wait for him at the drop off point. However I was later told to move to the inner parts of the terminal by the security guard. As the bags were really heavy I was unable to manage it on my own.

One of the staff from Marian South Ferries then approached me and assisted me with the bags to the waiting area. He did all these without me having to ask for help. Furthermore, seeing that we were running late for our ferry, he also went the extra mile to reassure me that we can board the next ferry at 9.30am instead, despite having booked tickets at another firm.

This really made our day and we really enjoyed our time through their services. Would highly recommend!"
Marina South Ferries,5,Amazing service! My friends and I had a little hiccup as one of us was going to be late than the departure time due to bad weather and heavy traffic. We asked whether there is a solution to this besides waiting for the next ferry which was a 2 hour wait and they offered to send my friend who was late on a smaller boat while we can take the ferry ride first and this hospitality was commendable. The boat itself was nice and there was a deck on top where it overseas the horizon and skyline which overseas singapore and was especially beautiful to be on when we left the island. Overall extremely pleased with the service and will happily recommend them to anyone who wants to travel to the southern islands :)
Marina South Ferries,5,"We travelled to St John’s Island on 20 March. We were pleased that the boat was clean and on time. However, what really stood out was the excellent service. The representative remembered us when we arrived at the St John’s jetty for the return journey and was very helpful. We would definitely use them again and highly recommend this provider."
Leong San See Temple,1,"Very nice looking temple with a lot of culture.

Was doing vlog for the temple and wanted to check with the employees for the specialty of the temple and the history.

They were pretty rude and impatient.

Technically if you're new to the temple, it's better to check out with the worshipper, they are more friendly.

Managed to understand more about a temple from a stranger instead.

Note: Maybe it's near closing hour, that's why they were impatient or what."
Leong San See Temple,1,service is definately less than one star. we had payed for a position to place our ancestors but was then moved to the back by a very rude lady who worked there. she also had the audacity to ask us to give her a red packet of $64 which she kept to herself instead of distributing with the workers there.she was overall rude and didn't seem interested in helping but instead the money.
Leong San See Temple,5,Very nice temple. Inside so beutiful
Leong San See Temple,3,It's a temple whereby I visit my ancestors during festive occasions.
Leong San See Temple,5,"This temple is hot
Subscribe to t series but you can choose not to. Ok let’s get serious I did a history report on this temple and it has a pretty interesting history! It’s awesome and do not hesitate to visit this temple. It will be a rewarding experience, I guarantee!"
Leong San See Temple,2,"It used to be so much better. I have visited this temple since my childhood days (25+ years, 1994) when my great grandmother was interred in the ancestral hall. In earlier days before the current Abbot took over, the temple was very tranquil and an aura of peace overcame it's visitors. About 5 years ago, the temple underwent a transformation for the worse with cluttered with cheap, uncouth decor all over the place, robbing the place of it's natural antiques. Everything else felt pretty commercial. I hope the best for the Abbot's health but hopefully the new management will bring the temple back to its better, older days."

Tiger Brewery Tour,5,"It was really a good tour, the guide was very professional and knowledgeable.(he can speak Chinese if you do not understand can asked him separately when walking) A little bit pity that the packaging area is under maintenance and cleaning. As per the guide normally Saturday after 3pm will have more chance to see the packaging running as normally Sunday for maintenance. Fully automated machines so you see very few people operating in the factory. Very good that they are using all the solar energy and also the Malt waste was also sent to chicken farm as chicken feed. Super clean and amazing tour. Best part is the beer drinking and different sample beer testing. The bear testing restaurant with very nice atmosphere. The finger food there was nice too. Don’t get drunk…. The beer test super! Very easy to be there with public transportation. Will recommend to my friends."
Tiger Brewery Tour,5,"Tour was insightful and the guides were friendly and accomodating. Look oug especially for the last leg segment of the tour where you'll end up in their famed ""Tiger Tavern"" where you get a complimentary pint of fresh beer from the tap. Kids friendly too with lovely bar snacks (own cost) and a little store selling Tiger Beer souvenirs to take home. Recommended 😀"
Tiger Brewery Tour,5,"Great tour, very underrated, just wish it were slightly longer! Got to sample 5 drinks each on top of the free pint and free bottle of tiger beer as souvenir. Out of the samples, Archipelago tasted really sour and bitter but not in a lemon sort of way, but the rest was good. You could try cider too. There's even a 0% alcohol free Heineken option."
Tiger Brewery Tour,5,"Great experience on Tiger brewery tour! Discovered the tour via Sparks app for couples in Singapore.

It is a 1hr tour that share about history of Tiger Brewery and shows the plants where beer is brewed and packaged. If you are one of the lucky quiz winners, you can also get to pour your own beer.

The tour ends at Tiger Tavern, where you can sample 5 beers and get a full pint for 1 beer. The Smalling portions are generous. The food is also reasonably priced. Bought truffle fries and chicken nuggets which were amazing.

Would highly recommend as a date activity for couples. Price is very affordable at $17 per pax on Sparks app."
Tiger Brewery Tour,5,Great 🍺 tour in Singapore 🇸🇬 the ending at the bar is the best part 😁
Tiger Brewery Tour,4,"A walking brewery tour with some interactive displays. There is a brief visit to sight the actual malt tanks, but no access to the bottling or packaging line or warehouses, which is slightly disappointing as in other brewery tours, these areas are always a highlight as they showcase the speed and vastness of the operation. The tour ends at the Tiger Tavern whereby you can taste up to six beers, one full size, five sampler size, as part of the tour price. Once visitors are allowed back, we’ll return."
Tiger Brewery Tour,4,"Decent brewery tour.
They show you the places and explain how the beer is brew. But you won't see the beers being produced in action

You got a fee beer after the tour (1/2 pint size) and 5 sampling of your choices.
They also have some simple food like chicken nugget popcorn chicken, onion rings, ...

To me the highlight was the bar after the tour

Pay attention to what tour guide say. You could get a free beer and pour your own beer if you answer correctly the questions they asked ;)"
Tiger Brewery Tour,5,Neat explanation of how singapore's iconic Tiger beer is brewed and even neater fresh beer afterwards!
World of Birdnest Museum,5,Great place to learn about bird's nest. The facilitator is very well educated and exp.
World of Birdnest Museum,5,Very nice place to learn about Bird's nest and swiftlets.

World of Birdnest Museum,5,"I loved the swiftlet garden museum, especially the chocolates and cookies!"

Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,5,Flying during pandemic time is not definitely the best time to fly however my stress and anxieties were alleviated by their friendly staff in SilverKris Lounge named Gina! She was very accomodating and made sure we fill in our tummy before the flight! She surely loves what she's doing and she make it a point that all of us receives an excellent service from her! ❤️
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,5,"Stayed from late morning, crossing over to lunch. Had a range of food available. From sandwiches to salad. The water for tea is kept at an optimal 80 odd degrees. Coffee available from self-service machine. Chicken satay was available at around lunchtime. Peanut gravy was not spicy, probably to cater for larger group of passengers.

Shower room is nice and spacious. Shampoo and body wash available. Similar to no frills hotel."
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,4,"Business and first class lounge. It's actually better than the gold lounge since that's for premium economy.
Decent food, vegetarian options and alcohol. Shower facility is there to help you freshen up. No place to lie down so in case you're planning to sleep during a long layover, think again.
If you found this review helpful please like it."
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,5,"Very nice lounge. I especially enjoyed the fish congee after my first long flight. This lounge also has showers which is perfect for a refresher during a long layover. After your shower, staff will immediately clean and restock the room once you leave. The shower rooms are fully stocked with most of the amenities you need such as, shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, hairdryer and more."
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,4,"thankful for this lounge being open as everything else in the airport is closed when we were there. Nice, clean and comfortable. Covid-19 changes: No buffet but The menu is accessible via QR code on the table while drinks are still self service."
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,5,Clean. Good selection of food. Fantastic bathroom and shower facilities. Lots of seating.
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,5,"The Private Room is such an oasis.
Quiet, serene and peaceful.

Massage chairs or a spa in the lounge would make it better"
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge,4,"Great airport. Travellers having break journeys can have nice time. In addition to shopping, many attractions like butterfly garden, Sun flower garden etc, provide for leisure time spending. Inter-terminal transfers have options of skytrain, bus etc. Airport is very clean, neat and well maintained. We had great time."
The Gem Museum,5,A great place to visit to learn about gemstones. The people there are very friendly and approachable. It was a fruitful learning experience from the knowledgeable staff. They also sell beautiful gems and minierals.
The Gem Museum,5,"Thank you to the wonderful staffs there for enriching me and my fiancee. It has been a eye opening experience to know about various apparatus purposes, and also how some gems were formed.
Thank you Andrew and Joanne (sorry if I spelt your name wrong) for this interactive experience!"
The Gem Museum,5,"It was a very educational and fun way to learn and understand about gems, my girl love it.

Do lookout for their kids workshop - Junior Rockstar Gem Adventure, suitable age between 7 To 12 YO."
The Gem Museum,5,Daughter here for a workshop the second time. Everything is arranged neatly and wasn't too overwhelming. Displays were informative and Andrew was rather good with the kids.
The Gem Museum,5,It was a wonderful experience for me. Andrew makes his visitor extremely comfortable to learn and ask questions about gem stones. Highly recommended!
The Gem Museum,5,"Visited back in early March. This museum is part museum and part gem shop. The museum isn't all that big, but covers the whole life cycle of gem formation. That is, from mining, to cutting and polishing, and finally sale. The curator of the museum also does a guided tour and it's great at answering questions about gems, being a qualified gemologist. There’s also some awesome gems on display or to buy in their gem shop upstairs. I also really enjoyed using a microscope to look up close at some of the gems which the curator was kind enough to demonstrate to me."
The Gem Museum,5,"I went for the guided tour and I'm glad I did. While the Museum is a small cozy place, there is much to learn from the guide and owner about gems. Both are knowledgeable certified gemologists. You can learn how gems are formed, both natural and synthetic, instruments used to determine the type and quality of gems, and of course a showcase of different gems. I highly recommend going for the tour especially if you have an interest in gems. And they do sell customized rings where you can select your favourite gem to be made into a ring. Ask them on the available gems in your favourite colour and you can be sure to be given a variety for you to choose."
The Gem Museum,5,Very interesting place. Fulls of Gems and minerals. Very patient to explain all the details to us. Join their members hip to enjoy great discount.
The Sandalwood Room,5,"Beautiful and gorgeous shop. I spend so much time here whenever I am in Singapore! Always something new and exciting to not just look at, but also buy. Perfect place for someone to spend an afternoon shopping to buy gifts for someone else or to indulge in yourself. As the tagline of the shop says, it suspends reality!!!"
The Sandalwood Room,5,"We stopped off for a day in Singapore before going on a 10-day round-trip cruise from there to other South-east Asian countries.  During our earlier visits to Singapore, we had been to the various tourist spots there and this time, we were looking for a unique place to shop.  Having heard about the ' Sandalwood Room' which had opened fairly recently, we decided to go there.  The 'Sandalwood Room', tucked between Sunshine Plaza and Princep Place on Princep Street, was well worth the visit.  It has a varied collection of ethnic clothing, jewelry, bags, home-decor items, fashion accessories and other hand-made products, some of which are one of a kind and not easily available elsewhere. The Boutique is charming and welcoming, with a pleasant and friendly staff.  If If anybody would like some unusual items to buy, this is the place to go to and we highly recommend it."
Raffles Lighthouse,5,"It's a quiet small island at the southern tip of Singapore. Not open to the public, but you can probably check out MPA for their free public trips to this island running once every year. Follow their Facebook for more details."
Raffles Lighthouse,5,"Had a rare opportunity to visit the Raffles Lighthouse back in 2015. The lighthouse serves as a navigational aid for ships at sea by giving off 3 white flashes every 20 seconds. On the top of the lighthouse, you get a bird's eye view of the tranquil sea. Built in 1885, Raffles Lighthouse is not usually open to the public, except for rare occasions, for instance, it was open over the weekends of April 2017 in celebration of the Singapore Maritime Week. So, if you ever get an opportunity to visit the Raffles Lighthouse, do seize it!"
Raffles Lighthouse,5,Not a place of interest. A place where no birds will lay eggs type. Do not bother to visit 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️
Raffles Lighthouse,5,"I believe more than 50% of the seafarer in the world have seen this lighthouse.

Raffles Lighthouse,5,So nice view..
Raffles Lighthouse,5,"Wow and Super wow. Finally get to visit this elusive place which is not generally open to public. This place is not accessible to public unless you are invited guest or you are a staff member. The event started with a tour around Singapore Maritime Gallery. The boat ride from Marina South Pier takes approx. 1 hour to Raffles Lighthouse (southern tip of Singapore). Upon arrival, the lighthouse is so majestic and the surroundings so serene. Noise is almost unheard of. It’s just you and mother nature.

You will need to abled body to climb 107 steps to the top of the lighthouse. The view is magnificent! However no pictures are allowed of the defence aerial towers (Vessel Traffic Information System or VTIS) and no usage of selfie stick at the top.  The guides and MPA staff are welcome and friendly. Good coordination, and ferry ride smooth and safe.

MPA should really try to do this often. As Singaporeans, we are so naive that our waterways will not be safe if not for these lighthouses and dedicated men/women who stay apart from the families just to ensure safe sea passage way. Kudos to you. Thank you MPA for organising this."
Raffles Lighthouse,4,"Beautiful place, but we were not allowed to go ashore, have to take pics from boat which brought us there. It's southern most of Singapore after this international water starts. Not allowed to take photo of tower."
Raffles Lighthouse,5,A landmark for sea navigation
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,"We joined the Creepy Tales of Singapore Tour. Well led  by Jasmine and Stanley, our pro guide. I usually trekking on those places on  daytime ,except Bukit Brown Cemetery . Unaware of the untold story ....Is mixture of historical and creepy legend  tour. Is informative and adventure experience expecially visit at night ! Highly recommend !
Thank you so much to Oriental Travel & Tours. I will be back...."
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,"Interactive. Interesting. Many goosebump-raising moments. Probably a sleepless night as well.
Refreshed my WWII knowledge, which I thought that I had given back to my history teachers...
Stanley and Jasmine were terrific guides who made the tour super interesting and engaging with their sharing of stories throughout the tour.
The chance to detect spiritual presences with EMF detectors was a great highlight as well.
Thoroughly loved this tour... “Creepy Tales of Singapore”"
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,We went on the creepy tales tour with Stanley and Jasmine. Both were extremely knowledgeable about Spore’s Japanese occupation we enjoyed the creepy stories Jasmine told. Found the tour extremely enjoyable especially for those that are interested in the paranormal. Was creeped out especially at Labrador Park where we encountered and communicated with a spirit. We were given EMF metres and I felt chills starting from inside my head right down to my toes. It was an experience to remember. We actually learnt a fair bit of history from Stanley about the Japanese occupation which you can never learn from history books. Both Stanley and Jasmine made this tour so interesting and the hours just flew by. Highly recommended indeed!
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,"Highly recommeded! Jasmine and the staffs goes above and beyond what we need, helping to ensure the kids and adult are happy and have an enjoyable trips  too. Thank you jasmine and staffs for the efforts."
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,We attended the bar hopping tour and the creepy tales tour. Both the tours deserve 6 stars! Our guides Stanley and Jasmin were fantastic. Thank you for making our trip so enjoyable.
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,"Amazing tour, our guide was incredibly well versed with the history of the city. He was fun and engaging. He took extra time to transfer photos to us so that we have amazing memories of our time in Singapore"
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,It was our first trip to Singapore and we wanted to see authentic local neighbourhood. We went for the Heartland tour and it was what we are looking for in the tour. The tour is good for those who want to see how the local live. Love the bird singing club and the friendly parrot at the garden.
Oriental Travel and Tours,5,"We booked a customised private tour. During the tour, we visited a local town, had local breakfast in a hawker centre, and for the first time in our lives drank coffee from a plastic bag. We enjoyed the experience."
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Nice and cozy place with beautiful cats. Staffs/owners are the most friendly staffs/owners among all the cats cafe in Singapore and nice to the kids.

Will be back again."
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Awesome cafe to mingle with the cats. Kids loving it so much! The host was entertaining too, thanks for his time in engaging with the ever active kids."
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,Had a really fun time today at Meomi Cat Cafe. Nice place that isn’t too big. Feels really cosy and the cats here are friendly and chill. Short five minute walk from Bugis MRT.
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,Our all-time favourite cat cafe! Also the very first cat cafe I brought my boy to and he loves it :) Pedigree cats here (if that's the correct term!) and our favourites are George and Oreo though there are other lovely ones there too!
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Although some of the cats were sleeping, the cafe owners were very friendly. That changed the entire experience at this cafe. I got to know more about each cat's personality and story. Rest assured, the meows are well taken care of and has a retirement plan unlike me. Do visit this cat cafe and buy their merchandize to support a non-profit cats rescue group (Yishun 326)."
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Even though it’s a very small place, but the owner is really friendly and nice! The cats are Super cute too!! Very worth to visit👍🏻"
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Cats are not as friendly as dogs so you need some patience to interact with them. The owners are very friendly, drinks are basic and the place is cozy. My boy really loves this birthday treat that I prepared for him. The owners really cares about their cats."
Meomi Cat Cafe,5,"Totally loved this place. Very warm and welcoming owners who take genuine care of the cats and make you feel so welcome. Thank you for your warmth and kindness for when we visited back in Jan. If you do visit this place, be ready to see King George."
Waterway Point,1,"Very poor service,  total disregard to senior citizens,  exploitation of unfair and unwarranted payment of service charge, deliberate reduction of food which was inconsistent to the price of food and no apology for the slackening of service.  One should never visit the Fish and co waterway point outlet after a bad experience on 30 August 2021 at 2.27 pm."
Waterway Point,5,One of the signature integrated developments for the punggol new town. Featuring a good mix of retail and f&b establishment to complement the needs of the suburbs. Seamlessly integrated with the sengkang punggol waterway to provide connectivity to the rest of the north east park network. Worth a visit if you are happen to be in the north east.
Waterway Point,4,Nice place to jog and walk around in the evening. The mall looks huge! Walk out of the mall and have a nice evening stroll to get away from your hectic work life! But this area is rather far from the city ...
Waterway Point,5,Lots of amenities. Spacious supermarket. Many food outlets. Situated next to a park connector.
Waterway Point,5,"Just into 11th day of Lunar New Year, Waterway point is busy, a little crowd in the week day though.
Not many space, you could find many cafe, kopi and restaurants. Half of the malls give you choices of food, wide variety, but very local.
If not for the stop by, i hardly come by this mall. Enjoy."
Waterway Point,4,It is a nice convenience mall to visit. Has lots of things to see and buy. Price reasonable. Food are good too
Waterway Point,3,OK mall. Minus one star because there is no clear signage in the car park stating which entrances were closed due to Covid (2 out of 3 closed). Have to walk all the way to the closed entrance to see a tiny A4 sign explaining which is open
Waterway Point,4,"For those who lives authentic pig liver,this is THE Best!
Cooked just nice,great gravy with slice chilli & pork lard!
Heaven sent!
This is one of the franchise stall,as they have quite a few around."
My Foot Reflexology,4,"Love the cause and ethos behind this company, many of their staff are visually impaired but amazingly they all can handle each customer with right techniques and strength. Friendly and considerate staff too; I can feel the bond and care they have for each as co workers. The senses of touch and feel have strongly proven the good skills of therapists, at times more evident in them, the special ones."
My Foot Reflexology,3,"First visit. Tried the foot massage, male masseuse was a tad too talkative for my liking. Overall massage was not too painful."
My Foot Reflexology,5,"If you feel painful or tired your body….just go!!!
I love shoulder +foot massage here."
My Foot Reflexology,5,"Did an Indian head massage and foot massage with Audrey and she is very good. Great pressure and she was very friendly but not overly talkative. Overall, a great first experience! Will return 😬"
My Foot Reflexology,5,Place is spacious and clean and I really like that this is a social enterprise employing visually impaired. Frankie was polite and cheerful and did an amazing job for my foot reflexology session. On my second visit I did an upper body and foot reflex with Ah Wen  who was very highly skilled and fixed my stiff neck. For this location the pricing is really reasonable! Will definitely come back more often 👍🏽
My Foot Reflexology,5,Went there for an upper body massage and Audrey did such a great job. She's very friendly and omg her hands are so strong. My neck and shoulders were feeling so much better!!
My Foot Reflexology,5,Probably my best foot massage in Singapore till date. Kevin was absolutely brilliant and I felt refreshed post the foot massage. Kudos to the management for providing opportunities to people with physical disability.
My Foot Reflexology,1,"This review is for the Chinese FRONT OFFICE Female personnel. I called and asked for my usual masseur and was told that he is not in. I asked for someone who does a similar style of massage and was told that she cannot make any recommendation because she has to be fair to her therapists.
Fairness is good and it sounds good right?
EXCEPT this is the VERY EXACT SAME PERSON who told my friend sometime back that each of the masseur they have is very individual with an area of specialty and that it is important for her to know what my friend was looking for so that she can ensure she assigns a masseur who is a proper match for my friend's needs.
People go for massages because they have a certain pain which they want alleviated and would like to be recommended someone who is better for working in that area.
To draw an analogy, it is like a lucky draw- you may have a a bad cough but if the dentist is next in line, then you will be assigned a dentist to treat your cough because it is fair.
I tried explaining to her that I needed someone who was better at working on the shoulders but she was SO UNRESPONSIVE that I gave up.
So, my question is - What is the philosophy that the company subscribes to? Actually, that is my question to that lady in the front as well.
Fairness to the therapists OR doing looking after the well being of the person seeking relief from pain and doing what is good for the person who needs the therapy."
The Punggol Settlement,3,"Many cyclists and joggers. Some just sit at night to chit chat. There are some eateries and an ice cream seller.

Can only reach via bus 84 from punggol bus interchange"
The Punggol Settlement,5,"This is a real gem for cyclist as a pit stop! Lot of eateries around, family friendly place for gathering.

If you’re around Punggol, remember to drop by to enjoy the sea breeze especially end of the year 🤗"
The Punggol Settlement,4,"Located at the end of Punggol Road, Punggol Settlement is dominated by seafood eateries such as House of Seafood, Jing Long Seafood Restaurant and Punggol Seafood. Other notable eateries include Balinese-themed Georges by the Bay, and White Restaurant, known for its Signature White Beehoon."
The Punggol Settlement,4,"Beautiful. Lucky to come during sunset, seen the sun setting are so lovely! Lots of eating places but not enough carpark!!! Must be careful of riders left & right though. They are everywhere 😳. Love it!"
The Punggol Settlement,4,"White restaurant
Punggol settlement

Above average dishes especially the volcano homemade toufu , yam ring filled with fresh prawns and chicken medley and the fried rice full of wok hei without being overly greasy.

Would have liked the white bee Hoon to be more soupy and clean tasting instead of the slightly sticky consistency presented.

Having a said that - pretty impressed that all dishes were executed well .

The salted egg sotong could be slightly more juicy and tender - this one felt a bit mummified 🤣( my only gripe )."
The Punggol Settlement,5,Beautiful ambience at night with many restaurants available. Great for family dinner and fun activities here.
The Punggol Settlement,5,It was a great day!!!
The Punggol Settlement,4,"A nice sea view and has a few restaurants. Good place to hang around after visiting Coney Island. For cyclists and joggers, the park connector is long enough for a good workout."
Marine Parade Market,3,"Yummy meesua and chili oil dumplings, a good place to get your Chinese food fix."
Marine Parade Market,5,Great variety of food and clean and neat. Well ventilated.
Marine Parade Market,5,"Inside this newly renovated hawker centre, it is now cleaner. I like the mixed vegetable rice with variety of delicious meat, vegetables to select. The stall is at the corner, nearest to Parkway Parade shopping center."
Marine Parade Market,4,"Ordered Soi 84, Thai food.. Phad Thai is one of the best I've tasted!! Service is also good and friendly! 😁"
Marine Parade Market,4,I seldom take Char Koay Teow but this stall the CKT take awesome although it kinda wet. The Chinese sausages they put into the CKT is very generous. Give it a try next time you are here.
Marine Parade Market,4,"Nice airy hawker center that has a unique tray return system. Lots to eat and choose from, as with all hawker centers in Singapore."
Marine Parade Market,5,"Traditional Oyster Mee Sua , Singapore version!  Very nice."
Marine Parade Market,5,Wohoo! Love this economical breakfast set. Even though the Ngoh Hiang is a bit too much flour. Q
Wheelock Place,4,"One if the biggest and busiest malls in Singapore with a beautiful design and ambience.
Spacious and airy it provides to all your needs, be it shopping, eating & drinking or just plain loitering.
Situated on Orchard Road, it is one of Singapore's iconic buildings.
Go there on weekdays to avoid crowds and queues."
Wheelock Place,3,Nice cone shape roof!
Wheelock Place,3,"Long standing shopping mall in Orchard Road shopping enclave, famous for its glass-cone structure. Place has undergone many renovations. Currently most of the F&Bs populate B2-L2 while some retail shops are scattered from basement to L3. Most of the higher levels are crowded with clinics and beauty spa/saloons. Connected to Orchard MRT station via underground passage"
Wheelock Place,4,Style by Style Vibes Cafe on the 2nd floor. Their local food menu is quite well done.
Wheelock Place,5,New Chinese Bookstore - The Zall
Wheelock Place,5,"Magical. It’s a bit slower here but still distinctly unique. There’s a charm here that is difficult to find. Always has this air of classiness and feel about it. Feels like when we were back in UK but yet with that exotic Asian feel that is sublime and makes the air crisp with that tinge of freshness.

Sit down and have a cup of coffee, or browse around, this place always calms me down."
Wheelock Place,4,A great place to shop and hangout but only during off- peak hours. There's also a new bookshop opened recently but largely selling Chinese books imported from China. It is nothing like the Borders. The entire building is rather small and enclosed with a lot of space wasted in this expensive plot of land.
Wheelock Place,3,"Lots of underpass
Rather pleasant due to non crowd"
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,"A quaint gallery with heaps on information on Singapore's Eurasian community, history, prominent icons, lifestyles and also their flavourful cuisine. The gallery is a must-visit. It is also very clean and they will also give you a disposable glove, tissues and a guide on the place. I liked that additional attention to detail on sanitation especially in these times. Also, if you want to indulge yourself into their flavourful delectable Eurasian food, head down to Quentin's thereafter and you would not leave disappointed. I love frequenting that restaurant every now and then."
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,"A beautiful gallery featuring stories and personalities from the Eurasian community. My favourite section was ""My grandfather's Road"" good information on whom some streets were named after. Gallery staff were welcoming and helpful.

The gallery space is cosy and the air con is at its best, might want to bring a shawl if you plan to be in the gallery for a while."
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,I visited the Eurasian Heritage Gallery during the My Community Festival and it was a very fruitful experience. The guides Alison and Petrina were very passionate and shared many stories and knowledge on Eurasian culture with the participants. The tour also included a delicious 4-course lunch from the Quentin’s on a well decorated table. There was even a “gift exchange” with presents already prepared by the staff. The entire itinerary was well thought out and was full of Christmas vibe.
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,4,Nice place!They prepare the fun pack for kids.
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,"Great food, good service. Close a tad too early. But it is worth it as the food is so yummy"
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,"Nice place, great Eurasian food! Such a delight!"
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,5,"The ultimate guide to Eurasian history, culture, food , lifestyle and their contributions to the community."
Eurasian Heritage Gallery,4,Interesting but static.
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,4,"I walked in and was lucky to be able to arrange for a aroma rich massage in an hour’s time. There’s weekday promo now. It started off with a warm foot bath. The foot bath comes with salt and it’s just a quick foot wash honestly. Ann Tan was like a motherly therapist, she was very chatty throughout the whole treatment which kinda wear me out cos I just want to relax and sleep. She knows where my blocked points are in the upper shoulders and apply the right pressure. It’s disappointing the sauna and shower facilities can’t be used during covid! She’s also kind enough to show me some of the other outdoor bath rooms, they are beautiful! The whole experience takes me back to Bali. 1 point off because it seems like I have to give a review on the spot."
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Now where do I even start... when I came I was greeted by a friendly staff and introduced me to the oils. I choosed mine and I was ushered to the waiting room. I was surprised as there isnt any promoting of other products( for me if there is, it will definitely be a major turn off) Im thn greeted by Marlia and proceeded to the room. I simply love the ambiance. I did the weekday promotion. When Marlia started to work with her magic hands i just simple knew she is someone with experience. I did the scrub first. The massage hasnt even started but i felt soooo relax. I was asked to take a shower and the outdoor area which feels like im in bintan! And my massage started. The pressure was on point. I felt some parts of my a lil strain but marloa seems to pick that up and she work on that part firm but gentle. I loved it when a warm weight was placed on my back and tummy when she moved to elsewhere. I could feel her calm energy which makes me relax. Like how sporean say.. "" syiok lah!!"" I will definitely return and perhaps Aramsa will be the only place i pampered myself. Thank you Aramspa and of course Marlia. Much love"
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,4,"After a long time, went for a massage. Upon reaching there I was warmly and cheerfully welcomed by the receptionist. She took time to further explained about my package that I had previously purchased. Then I was ushered to the massage room where the massage therapist Ms. Grace performed her services with exceptional skill. She was polite, respectful and knowledgeable in performance of her duties.
One thing I sorely missed is their lemongrass and ginger tea with biscuits.
I will continue visits them for my massage needs.

Thank you Aramsa for your services provided."
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Wendy and Pauline. Thank you for your hospitality. You have made me and my spouse feel comfortable and relaxed. The environment is very cosy and calming. Pauline tried her best to let loose some areas. She asked me a couple of times whether I'm okay with her pressure. And, if there's a need for her to adjust. Appreciate the level of care given. Aramsa Touch technique is indeed unique."
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Staff are extraordinary. I had a wonderful experience from the moment I step in until I went out. Everyone is friendly. Ira, my therapist is very professional and knows what she is doing. She is amazing. Would definitely recommend Aramsa Spa to everyone I know. Definitely worth it. This is the best thing that happened this week. Beautiful place, magical experience indeed best in Singapore!! Feel so good, better physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually!! Greatly appreciate your service:)"
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Probably one of the very few places in Singapore where you can enjoy your spa and massage experience amongst nature, away from busy malls and concrete city centre.

Aramsa is constantly fully booked, and it rightly should be. What a great massage experience, thanks to my therapist Eileen who took great care, from the moment I stepped in to the warm ginger tea at the tea room after the session. Did I mention the hot compress pillows and calming tune with 🐦 chirpings in the background.

Highly recommended if you need to get away from it all during this time. Call them well in advanced and come experience this little piece of nature."
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Very beautiful ambience, our therapists Hani and Rena were very professional and very good with their techniques. It's been a long time since I had a good massage like this. Hani was able to use the right strength and technique to loosen the knots in my back muscle."
Aramsa ~ The Garden Spa,5,"Rena is amazing ...she was so communicative and did exactly the right pressure, and I feel so relaxed.  The garden spa has a lovely ambience and the treatment rooms are very nice.  Everyone from the front desk also very helpful.  Wonderful experience and can recommend it highly."
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,5,"Our Lady of Lourdes is one of the beautiful heritage Catholic church located in Little India  was built in 1888 by a French priest. Originally built to serve Indian Catholics but now serves all races. Recently restored, it is now a beautiful landmark located at Ophir Road. It’s a recommended place to visit for Those who are interested in heritage and history and also for those who are Catholic and stay in Singapore during Sunday its might be a recommended church to visit on Sunday morning service."
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,4,Very rustic church along Queens Street.
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,3,Our Lady Of Lourdes Catholic Church on Ophir Road was built in 1888. It is due to be renovated soon.
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,5,I love lourdhu shrine... Our Lourdhu of lady my happiness ever think is there..
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,5,I was glad that I got a chance to go to Church for Mass and receive Holy Communion.
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,5,I used the Apparition Room Parlour for the funeral wake for my mum. Staff were attentive and sensitive. Alex and the other staff were always available but kept a respectful distance. Keeping to COVID-19 regulations was all the more imperative because the staff were always responsive - I called them when there were electrical trips or to adjust the temperature in the room. I would say that my experience was made highly positive because of the positive interactions and sensitivity shown by the staff. Thank you Alex and everyone at the office of OLOL.
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,5,A charming catholic church near Bugis MRT station. The smallest between her sister churches nearby.
The Church Of Our Lady Of Lourdes,4,Beautiful historic church build in 1888.
Youth Olympic Park,5,"We enjoyed exploring the Youth Olympic Park, which is located near the marina bay floating stage. The park is well maintained and manicured. There are a lot of nice installations here with a lot of photos and names of olympians from various countries. The place offers nice views and photo opportunities. A nice place to explore if you are near the MBS."
Youth Olympic Park,5,Its a must visit place for all the people who visiting Singapore .
Youth Olympic Park,5,Probably the best place to take pictures of CBD on sunset.
Youth Olympic Park,5,"Nice place for a walk trip or ride with a prepaid scooter. Quite relaxing and not typically crowded. We passed by here to get to Marina Barrage taking the path from Marina Bay's The Shoppes. These nice built architecture tells me how Singapore have constantly strives to maintain its sophisticated, nature-inspired and public friendly environment. They do highly thinks for the welfare of the public tourists and regular visitors."
Youth Olympic Park,5,A good place to take long walks alone or with friends.
Youth Olympic Park,5,From around the park some pretty incredible photos can be taken towards to Central Business District area among others. I usually run in and around this park and it is a feast for the eye to see all the high rises and Helium Bridge and Marina Bay Sands from here independent from what time of the day it is.
Youth Olympic Park,4,You get magnificent view of marina bay sands and downtown Singapore. Beautiful park to be go for a stroll.
Youth Olympic Park,4,Nice place to see the sunser
Luxury Coach Services,5,Used one of my sg rediscover vouchers for their nature and farm tour. Tour by the guide was very informative and introduced parts of SG I didn't even know about.
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Enjoyed our journey from Singapore to Malacca. Comfortable coach, friendly, informative and amusing guide Henry. They detoured in Malacca to drop us close to our hotel. Would definitely use them again."
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Currently on the bus PC9633 to Malacca. Everything is pleasant, the Chirpy bus driver and the tour leader. They will even drop us nearby our hotel in Malacca and also, rearranged pick up at the place closer to our hotel during departure. Seats are clean n comfy. No complaints, thumbs up."
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Coach seats are top-notch so is the service. Seats were made of leather, wide and extremely comfortable. Extremely clean and there was no issues with check-in. Drivers were punctual and very friendly. Shout-out to Henry (an Indian uncle) who ensures that everyone is the bus is comfortable and confirms the drop-off point of each individual passenger. Thanks alot. Will definitely be a returning customer."
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Totally had no problem with the service provided. Left on time, was kept more than informed when crossing the boarder into Malaysia and was dropped as close as possible to my hotel in Malacca. And as the company name suggests, they are luxury coaches."
Luxury Coach Services,5,Friendly driver. Very clean bus. Careful driving no speeding. Also in bus tour guide is very focus in her job. Very details in recommending Malacca along the way. Good ride
Luxury Coach Services,5,Fantastic experience.  Travelled from Singapore to Malacca.  Booked online.  Picked up tickets on departure.  No problem.  Great guide on the bus.  Henry was helpful and funny.  Dropped us close to our hotel.  There are other cheaper operators.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OUTFIT.
Luxury Coach Services,5,Wide recliner armchairs with only 3 chairs spaced across the bus.  Great tour guide got on the bus on our trip from Singapore to Melacca. Very pertinent travel tips from her as well as good humour.
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Easy to buy tickets from Singapore to Malacca,  relatively easy to find the check in and boarding areas. The bus was on time, very comfortable, and nice air conditioning. There are a limited number of drop off points to choose from, but they accomodated everyone on the coach and dropped each of us at the hotel we were staying at. The guide who joined us in Malaysia provided some good information about where to go and what things were typically Malaysian and thus should be experienced. The only negative is that at the quick stop all of the passengers were back by the appointed time, but we had to wait an additional 7 minutes for the driver and guide to get back. Overall, a great experience."
Luxury Coach Services,1,"bus broke down, replacement took over 3 hours to arrive, and the communications with the passengers while everyone was stranded at the side of the road was nonexistent.

not only that, they didn't even offer any form of compensation or refund for their incompetence and terrible handling of the situation and their lack of basic servicing of the busses.

horrendous experience - honestly just find ANY other bus service or book a flight. don't waste your money here...luxury prices but dodgy and lacklustre service and operation"
Luxury Coach Services,5,Great bus journey from Singapore to Malacca. Took the quick route across the border and no problems crossing. The ride was really smooth and the driver and conductor were friendly. Good drop off in Malacca.
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Wonderful experience! Bus was on time, extremely comfortable, and even had very good WiFi. I know there are many  bus companies to choose from, but I would definitely take Luxury Coach again!"
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Amazing service! Free wifi on the coach, small TV screen on the back of each seat for entertainment, cushy seats with a lot of leg room and ample of space for bags. Guide was also very thoughtful and took time to understand our travel plans to see if the bus can drop us off someplace nearer to our accommodations"
Luxury Coach Services,1,"The journey from Singapore to KL took over 10+ hours. Yes, the seats are decent, but the bus itself was terribly maintained, and due to some ""aircon issues"", the driver stopped at a random spot 100+km into the journey, and they said that a replacement bus was on the way.

Other than that, there was no update, and we ended up waiting in the heat of midday for over 3 hours for this ""rescue bus"" to actually turn up. They claimed that it was on the way from the moment we stopped, yet it took over 2 hours. You can literally drive a replacement bus from Singapore to the spot we were at in that time, yet they claimed it was nearby and on the way when we first stopped.

They handled the situation really really badly, and I DO NOT recommend this bus service at all. There was little way of apology or any form of compensation for the bus journey taking over double the time it was supposed to, all due to the fact that they do not bother maintaining and servicing their buses. They also didn't provide any updates during the uncomfortable wait in the middle of nowhere, and anything they did say was completely inaccurate.

Avoid them like the plague...if things go well it's ok, but when they don't, and it seems more and more likely they won't go well - given the lack of proper maintenance - be prepared for a terribly long, uncomfortable experience all while paying a super premium price."
Luxury Coach Services,3,"Please fix the leak in some buses. During rainy season, the super comfortable seats are no use when there's water leaking from the roof."
Luxury Coach Services,5,The Malaysian tour guides are a gem. Great personality and always ready to help. Quality of bus needs improvement. Time to replace the fleet.
Luxury Coach Services,3,"Booked 2 way from sg to malacca. Tour guide told me to be at pick up at 2:45pm when in fact the correct timing was 3:30pm. To make matters worse, the bus did not arrive until 3:50pm. So we wasted 1 hour. Apart from that, everything else was great."
Luxury Coach Services,5,Safe and discipline coach drivers. Punctual and comfortable seats
Luxury Coach Services,5,"I am writing about my  recent experience with Luxury Coach . I bought 3 tickets to go Malaysia through a  3rd party website . However due to some technical issue there were some  errors on the departure date. Payment went through but the date on the invoice was wrong.Not knowing how to rectify this problem with two small kids ready to travel,I called the 3rd party website administrator who then  referred me to Luxury Coach. I spoke to this lady by the name of  Eleen, the manager. She rectified the problem within minutes and with no charges at all with less questioned ask. She is very empathetic and professional.  Now waiting to experience my journey in the bus.

Mohamudh, Singapore"
Luxury Coach Services,5,"Service was professional and swift when we arrived at the Concorde Hotel to check-in for our departure - Khoo handled the check-in, and was our driver all the way to Malacca. He was pleasant and jovial, and seemed to enjoy his task, what a pleasurable way to travel.

We were joined later by a Malaysian guide, Ms Beena, who was a darling with her efficiency in delivering the ‘to dos’ and reminders for immigration and customs check. We left JB checkpoint in a breeze. Her touch of humour in her delivery was delightful, as much as her brief guide about the history of Melaka, learned a few good things from it!

Ms Beena was helpful in getting us a change from our original drop-off destination to one that was closer to our hotel. Deepest appreciation! Thank you, Ms Beena.

Coaches were clean and comfortable, and the driving was smooth and safe, to and from Malacca. Many thanks to Ah Khei as well, our driver ex-Malacca, for our trip back to Singapore.

It was a most enjoyable journey and stay in Malacca. Luxury Coach is aptly named, indeed. Thank you everyone! ❤️"
Luxury Coach Services,4,Well maintained Quality coaches. One of the best options for travelling to mallacca for weekend getaway from Singapore.
Luxury Coach Services,2,The newer bus on return had better entertainment. The older bus however had below average entertainment and saw a cockroach.
Luxury Coach Services,5,Great experience... from polite booking staffs up to the coach drivers. The bus are very clean and comfortable compare to other coaches..👍👍👍👍👍
Luxury Coach Services,4,"It’s alright for a bus ride back from your travel destination.

Level of luxury depends on how you booked the bus.

Bus that I took has USB charging points for your phone or powerbank."
Luxury Coach Services,5,"High quality experience traveling from Singapore to Melaka. The buses are clean and very comfortable seats. WiFi and movies playing on our personal tv’s help pass the time. Office was easily located in the basement of the Concordia Hotel and the buses pick up right outside the office. The check in process was easy and the driver was very attentive and helpful which is always a plus. The border crossings were easy and efficient. I definitely recommend them for your trip from Singapore to Melaka!

Happy travels... I hope this review helps with your travel adventures when in Singapore!"

Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,3,A place to learned some history about Japanese occupation. Can go thru to Bukit Batok Nature Park as well. There is a stair case that lead to the top so one can exercise well here. Limited parking space but it is free though. The road to this place is quite steep too so you can have a good exercise even before you reach the top.
Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,5,Love the serenity of this place..a nice place for a walk or jog
Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,5,Great place to enjoy the nature trail and get a chance to appreciate this historical site
Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,4,"The war memorial area rest on a long flight of steps leading to the hill top. Along the fence at the top, it is quite eerie with sign of enter at own risk. Lorong Sesuai beside is out of bound . Enter the bukit batok park on the left side. Nice park with plenty of fresh air but take care if entering at at night for the adventurous. Heard that there are stories about it."
Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,5,Beautiful place to visit 👍
Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Site,5,A good place to explore.

Chinatown Visitor Centre,5,"The Chinatown Visitor Centre (CVC) runs walking tours and heritage classes is a hit among visitors here. The Chinatown Business Association runs the CVC.

At Kreta Ayer Square just behind the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is the CVC offers detailed information about Chinatown’s shops, history and culture. Other than being an information resource base, there will also be daily themed walking tours available.

From Chinese myths and taboos to dialect clans and heritage brands, the tours - organised in partnership with travel agent Tour East - are designed to give visitors a taste of the real Chinatown complete with experiential elements, such as live demonstrations, food tasting and opportunities to interact with the locals.

The Clan and Association Walking Tour, for example, takes visitors on a tour of the organisations in Chinatown and includes lion dance and Cantonese opera performances.

Other tours like the Chinese Custom Walking Tour involves visits to medical halls and shops selling ceremonial items; while the Food Walking Tour lets visitors sample a traditional local breakfast and shop for fresh produce at a wet market.

The centre is an ideal anchor where people can get together and participate in activities to enjoy Chinatown the way they want to.

Drop by one of these centres in downtown Singapore to get more information about Singapore, purchase tickets to attractions and tours or pick up a souvenir."
Chinatown Visitor Centre,5,Must visit Buddha temple here. Peaceful. I bought lot of souvenier from the local shops here. Great for street shopping
Chinatown Visitor Centre,5,This center provide good information on attractions near China Town. It is also sells attraction tickets. The staffs was helpful and friendly.

Chinatown Visitor Centre,3,"A great place to stop by to see the souvenirs and enjoy the AC. It is so hot and humid in the whole Chinatown surrounding. There is a stage in front of the visitor center, it always has shows for the seniors."
Chinatown Visitor Centre,4,Can found Terengganu Street around here..haha
Fort Canning Lighthouse,5,"Just like the air traffic control tower that moniters planes landing, taking off and moving around at the airport, lighthouses used to serve the same purpose before planes existed. And the best place to establish a base and erect a watch tower was naturally a Fort Canning Hill because of its strategic location so they could keep an eye on and guide all ship traffic that passed through Singapore harbour."
Fort Canning Lighthouse,4,Great place
Fort Canning Lighthouse,3,"Saw the Fort Canning Lighthouse back in March before the shutdown. This lighthouse is a functioning replica of the original lighthouse that once sat atop Fort Canning Hill. It's a great reminder of how important maritime trade was once to Singapore. It’s not an amazing thing to see, but it’s worth a look if visiting Fort Canning Park."
Fort Canning Lighthouse,3,"Finally visited the Fort Canning Lighthouse. Small and short lighthouse, but well maintained."
Fort Canning Lighthouse,5,Historic Lighthouse📸
Fort Canning Lighthouse,5,"Before the era of the modern skyline, Fort Canning was a good place to build a lighthouse because it sits at a higher elevation and thus offers a commanding view of the city and harbor. This lighthouse seems to have served its country well in the many years it was in use."
Fort Canning Lighthouse,5,Beautiful lighthouse...
Fort Canning Lighthouse,4,"A lighthouse! Guided ships in the past, but the seaside is now many kilometers away due to massive land reclamation."
Police Heritage Centre,5,"Enjoyed the trip with the family. Will need to clear the security check and the guided tour was warmly hosted by 2 personnel, one being a police officer. At the end of the session, the kids can choose one of the 3 toy police vehicles."
Police Heritage Centre,5,P.kumaran years 69 own work B/E
Police Heritage Centre,5,Very educative tour
Police Heritage Centre,4,A nice place to bring kids to explore the place. An educational tour of Singapore Police history. Need to register in advance as they only allows registered personnel into the building.
Police Heritage Centre,4,This place may not be designed for foreigners but still worth visiting.
Police Heritage Centre,5,Great breakfast at canteen!
Police Heritage Centre,5,"The children enjoyed the tour! Children are able to wear kids sized police uniform, very cute!"
Police Heritage Centre,5,Interesting place to learn about SPF history. Tour guide is very enthusiastic and passionate while giving the tour.
Marlin Divers,5,"Great team to dive with.

V professional set up. great care for the dive sites, not dropping anchor.

Nice ratio of guide to divers so perfect if you don’t like to dive in a big crowd."
Marlin Divers,5,Awesome place to learn and go on trips! Experienced fun times with them and took back plenty of great memories. Highly recommended.
Marlin Divers,5,"Thanks guys, Leo and myself had a great day with you diving off Singapore. Thanks for organising everything from food, equipment, etc. Really appreciate your team, super professional and well organised. We will be back"
Marlin Divers,5,"My partner and I took our PADI Open Water Diving Course with Marlin Divers, and enjoyed it immensely! The team was helpful and friendly, queries were responded to in a prompt and professional manner, and there was no hard selling of packages or products. The rental gear were in good condition, and logistics for the open water sessions were well taken care of. Our instructor Jonathan is knowledgeable and thorough, making sure we learned the techniques properly. Thanks again Jonathan, E Lin, Martin and Ken for making our first dive experience so memorable!"
Marlin Divers,5,"When I first reached out to Marlin Divers to do my Advanced Open Water, I was unsure of both my intentions and physical capacity for diving. I hadn't dived in almost 4.5 years! However the couple team behind the brand, Martin and E Lin, and instructors Andrew and Arthur were always very thorough and encouraging. They probably believed in me more than I did so myself! With newfound joy in diving, I went beyond my initial objective and completed the Nitrox and Peak Performance Buoyancy specialities as well.

Each dive was always a new experience - new friends onboard, new dive buddies, new marine life, new situations to deal with underwater. But spirits were always high, and I gained valuable technical and soft skills and vicarious dive experiences from both instructors and buddies alike. With all my sincerity, I would like to thank everyone who has made this a fulfilling journey for me, and may we all have more wonderful dive adventures around the world!"
Marlin Divers,5,"I just ended a basic open water course with Marlin Divers. The instructors are friendly and thorough with their coaching and I would say thanks to that I got a good head start in mastering basics of diving safety. Overall, my dive lessons always are in great company of helpful coaches and fellow dive students. My direct instructor was E lin and there was much to learn from her as well as Martin. Good job guys!"

Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"My best boating experience in Singapore. The yacht is absolutely stunning and is maintained to the highest standard. Everything is so modern and new and we were incredibly comfortable. The captains went above and beyond for us and they really prioritize safety. Anything you could possibly need (hot shower, cutlery, kayak, paddle board, ice, drinking water) is available. Cannot wait to book again. Thanks for an unforgettable experience."
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"We loved our trip with Waga Mari! The crew were super attentive to our needs and style- and accommodated to make sure it was memorable. You can go with nothing and let them know what you’ll need to drink and bbq.  Access to incredible water sports etc.

It was raining the day we went and still felt
WELL worth it- so if that says anything! Book waga Mari! We will definitely
Be booking them again in the future."
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"Hands down by far the best boating experience in Singapore. The caption and crew were super friendly, professional and attentive to cater to all our needs. Looking foward for another memorable adventure with them."
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"We have chartered the Waga Mari team twice in the past two months and can wholeheartedly recommend this service to anyone looking for a short staycation experience in and around Singapore!

The captain and the team are simply amazing, highly attentive and we felt very safe in their care.

Fun times on the boat, the kayak and the paddle board and a super BBQ with lots of great wine with friends, we will be back!!"
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"What an amazing day out! Thank you for all of your hospitality,  we're still talking about our day out with you! Beautiful catamaran,  delicious food and a super team, we'll be back!"
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"If you're looking to propose on a Catamaran, the Waga Mari would be the perfect yacht. It's big, spacious with an excellent crew. Thank you Martijn and Valdimr! The proposal couldn't have gone without a hitch if not for the both of you."
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,Lovely staff! They even helped me with my life jacket basics. So friendly
Waga Mari Catamaran Charters,5,"Over the May 8th wkend we took a Waga Mari charter and it was far the best boating experience I have had in Singapore. Martijn and Vlad were amazing hosts, the food provided was excellent with plenty of choice and the wines provided were great and reasonably priced. The boat is very spacious with plenty of room for large groups ( once Covid restrictions pass). I will definitely be using Waga Mari again!"
Polar Bear Gallery,5,Great host and cosy place with some delightful off-the-beaten track art pieces especially if you like anime. Don't think you can find a better place for anime
Polar Bear Gallery,5,"Polar Bear Gallery hosts very rare original production celluloids from Studio Ghibli like My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke,  Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Kiki's delivery service etc.

The gallery also displays artworks from Inoue Naohisa. He is the background artist from Studio Ghibli and the only artist that painted his works on the wall of Ghibli Museum alongside with Miyazaki's works.

For Tezuka Osamu's fans, the gallery has limited prints of Astroboy which is of collectible value."

On Tap,4,"Draft beers of all kinds at good prices ($6.50-$9 per 330ml glass). No fanciful names, no pretty glasses, just beer.

Been here many times. The blonde ale is a little flat today and it can be colder. Perhaps the business has been affected by the pandemic."
On Tap,2,"First time here and wanted to try their beers since a friend recommended. I've also read the good reviews.

So let's start with the beers - IPA and Porter. We rate them good to excellent. Nicely brewed, flavourful and smooth. Served in chilled glasses as they should be.

However, the service pales in comparison to the other hawker stalls around. Can I say unfriendly? Perhaps indifferent. Looking at the other reviews (with complimentary nuts and friendly service), let's just say that our experience was no where near.

No effort on the server's part to engage us first-time customers on their products or setup, even after much prompting from us. Replies were curt and even consider rude Maybe it was a bad day for him...

Well overall rating dipped from 4 to 2 stars"
On Tap,5,Very affordable. Brewmaster is very hands-on.
On Tap,5,"If in the mood for some tasty beer, head over to the Chinatown Complex, go to the 2nd floor, and hit up On Tap Fresh Brew Craft Beer.

I ordered two beers, was given a decent amount of salted nuts, and relaxed in the food court area. The beer is on tap, and both beers tasted delicious!!

Check it out!!"
On Tap,5,Good tasting beer. I had blond. Light and tasty. Order the pork satay a few stalls away. Pair together simply perfect!
On Tap,1,"I would have given a -ve  star if there's one! Rude server. No manners and lack knowledge of what he's serving.  Ordered a wheat beer and a smoked ale. When asked what style It was, he gave a very unfriendly response that it's German.  I tasted it and it was Belgian wheat style.  Turned out to be poorly brewed, tasted like medicine water. IT WAS FLAT, lacked proper temp and carbonation.  If it's locally brewed, shame on you. The other beer we ordered was equally poor. Had to spit it out.  It's worst than any amateur brew I have tasted. Please show your paying clients that you are serious about calling yourself craft beer. And that those names on the wall mounted poster calling themselves master brewers.
I'm happy to sit with these master brewers for a chat if you read this. Shame on you!"
On Tap,5,"Good effort on brewing local beer and very reasonable prices too.

Located in a corner of the hawker centre and might be difficult to find, but note the stall number. You can easily access through the steps (see photo) on Trengganu Street."
On Tap,5,Great local brews at pocket friendly prices. It's like happy hour 24/7. Love it! Variety of beers available to cater to different palate!
Enjoy Tea,5,"My friend recommended me to Michael and oh my, have I threaded upon treasure! I had an introductory course to tea drinking with Michael and was amazed at how even the basic holding vessel of tea can affect the taste, aroma and even smokiness of the tea.

Michael has a very artistic approach to tea drinking and is definitely driven by a deep-set passion that radiates the moment you strikes a conversation with him about tea.

If you want an enriching and impactful experience that you will remember for months and years, go to Michael to learn about the art of tea-drinking."
Enjoy Tea,5,"After our lunch at Maxwell Food Centre, my wife and I walked to Enjoy Tea to check out their offerings of tea leaves and tea ware. Products are creatively displayed on open shelves and a long table in the middle. The contemporary and zen-like interior designs are a nice contrast to the aged Chinese tea culture.

We were greeted by Michael Teo, the owner, who proceeded to explain the preparation and pairing of teapot, tea cups and the tea over the next 1.5 hours. Time flies when you are having fun. More than fun, it was an opportunity for us to learn from Michael's years of enjoying Chinese tea.

We left with purchases of his exceptional oolong tea and 2 Ruyao tea cups to enjoy our Chinese tea henceforth."
Enjoy Tea,5,"The tea tasting was an unexpected but truly amazing experience, that I recommend to anyone.
I was not familiar with Chinese tea, but curious about why the tea pots are so small, so I asked Michael about it.
He responded by inviting me to do a tea tasting, which turned into a meditative journey learning about the different teas, pots, materials, tastes, smells, and how to appreciate it. His and his apprentice Sarah's knowledge and passion, combined with an openness to share their culture and love for tea made this a moment I won't forget.
By the time I left the shop, I felt as if I had discovered a whole new world, and realized that we spent more than an hour sitting and chatting and enjoying tea."
Enjoy Tea,5,The most luxurious and smooth tea accessories & tea leaves in Singapore. Be expected to pay premium but it will be worth the money after you try as it is a whole new level of tea tasting. Oolong is simply amazing
Enjoy Tea,5,Haven for tea lovers and tea drinks who is keen to explore the tea varieties and tea art/culture.
Enjoy Tea,5,"Visited today and was met with warm hospitality. The owner, Mr Michael Teo, recommended Huang Guan Yin(黄观音）, after understanding my preference. He invited me to take a sit while he prepared the tea for tasting.

His knowledge and sharing, allows me to learn and appreciate the art of tea drinking. Price does not equals quality. But here at Enjoy Tea, I find great value to the recommendation and chance for tea tasting,w an opportunity to learn from a connoisseur, which is indeed valuable.

Overall, highly recommended to spend a great time learning and enjoying a tea session."
Enjoy Tea,5,Mr Michael was very friendly and spent a lot of time explaining tea to us. Highly recommend!
Enjoy Tea,5,"This shop specializes in Yan Cha (rock oolongs) and have an excellent selection of tea, especially for tea drinkers that fancy well balanced and complex teas. The owner, Michael Teo, is a true tea enthusiast and is very knowledgeable on the subject matter - if you can describe the kind of tea you like, he will be able to find something that suits your palette. Rather than try to upsell his tea with words, he confident that the tea he sells will speak for itself - so often he may offer you a sample tasting (which you should definitely accept !) A must visit for any Chinese tea connoisseur"

When the was over some men went to barber tent, they have next to the Temple and shaved their hair. Very busy and noisy place in that day with traditional music and people dancing on their  way to the last Temple where the pilgrimage is finish."

Hajjah Fatimah Mosque,4,A mosque very nice n clean n friendly staff
Hajjah Fatimah Mosque,5,"Mdm Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman was a tradeswoman and philanthropist. She was born in Malacca to a well-known and wealthy trading family. After her first marriage failed, she married a Bugis merchant-prince, Daing Chanda Pulih.

Unfortunately her husband died not long after they married.  She then took over his business. Mdm Hajjah Fatimah already had several boats of her own, and making good use of her late husband’s extensive network, she expanded the business significantly.

In the late 1830s, Hajjah Fatimah built herself a large house in Kampong Glam but, as was common during those times, thieves ransacked her house twice. On the second occasion, they burned it down. Fortunately, she was away at the time and was not harmed.

To demonstrate her gratitude to divine providence for having spared her life, Hajjah Fatimah built a mosque, between 1845 and 1846, on the land where her residence once stood. The mosque was eventually named after her - Hajjah Fatimah Mosque.

Combining eastern and western design elements, the mosque is known for its unique minaret, which resembles a church spire, and the noticeable tilt of its minaret, which has led some to refer to it as the “leaning tower of Singapore”. The mosque was gazetted as a national monument on 28 June 1973."
Hajjah Fatimah Mosque,5,SERENE PLACE WITH A BEAUTIFUL PARK OUTSIDE

Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"✨Absolutely beautiful Church✨

Been here during and after renovation for mass. The church’s interior walls evokes so much sense of, and calling to, holiness. You could actually smell a hint of incense even without it’s presence.

The safe distancing management during this ongoing crowned disease is well handled and their team members are very professional. Sacrament of Confession has queue number which allows us to kneel and pray quietly while waiting for our turn. Lesser movements too.

I always see Father Ferdinand actively hearing confessions even at the final minute before mass begins. An inspiring holy man of God!

The altar is well maintained and very clean. I mean like it’s really visually sparkling clean. Likewise are the pews and floors. The choir is so  very super angelic and the organists are super talented. The way the church architecture is designed is so sound, so practical, that their choir voices would probably be able to move even the hardest of hearts.

I’ve attended regular morning mass before the lockdowns. During mass, there’s so much moments of silence and reverence. A very nice place to start the day right and in order! Even masses online during the circuit breaker are quite edifying.

Very holy place right at the heart of Singapore.

Oh yeah, there’s also coffeeshop nearby with plenty of food options to choose from. There’s an MRT station just outside the church. The nearest bus stop can pretty much take you to any places in Singapore.

If you’re a tourists visiting Singapore, this is quite a place to visit!

Deo gratias for everything!"
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,Very comfy cozy and the staff are very nice..
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"One of my favourite Catholic Churchs in Singapore.
The homilies are always very meaningful.
Adoration Room is a wonderful and quiet place to spend some time with God on weekdays during lunch time or evening mass as the church is in the Central Business District. Weekend mass is always full, so go early.
Next to the church is Catholic Welfare Services and a lot of eateries and coffee shops."
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"Exquisite glass stain windows and beautifully designed modern Church with a feel of the old times. You get a very peaceful and calm feeling once inside. Nice arrangements are made for prayer.

The Church is located in the heart of the city and is easily accessible from any of the main hotels in the city centre.

A must visit for any Catholic visiting Singapore."
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is now celebrating it’s 150 years Anniversary. A year long celebration from June 30,2019 until June 30,2020. Msgr Francis Lau grace the occasion to start."
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"A historic Catholic church in Bras Basah Bugis area Singapore.

I am not an expert, but the design and architecture is amazing! Preserving most of the original properties, time seems to be frozen here.

Reading the history of it, I wished they still kept the original altar and pipe organ. Alas previous modernisation actually destroyed the characters of the building.

But still, its function as a worship place and the cool ambience are worth visiting to pray.

It is one of few places where I think best to can listen to Him and embrace His blessings.

From their website, the schedule is as follow:

Weekday Masses: 720 am and 530 pm.
Sunday Masses: 830 am Mandarin, 1100 am English, 200 pm Cantonese and 400 pm English."
Church of Saints Peter and Paul,5,"Great preaching and prayerful atmosphere!

Saturday anticipated mass at 5:30 pm.
Sunday masses at 11 am and 4 pm.
The priests are available for confessions after the weekday morning mass."

Degiosart,5,"The fashion items are awesome. I also liked the antique statue I bought, it looked stunning in my house. The owner was a helpful and very nice man."
Degiosart,5,The clothing material are really comfortable and the designs are unique. It is worth buying! Highly recommended!
Degiosart,5,"Beautiful place to find unique art, antiques and collectibles from around the globe. The collections of Tibetan rugs as well as Japanese obi and vintage Haoris are amazing!
The owner is very knowledgeable, kind and always happy to spend time guiding you through his pieces."
Degiosart,5,It was a delight to spend time admiring their pieces and Pino the owner  was extremely generous in sharing his time and knowledge.
Degiosart,5,"Wonderful gallery in the heart of Tiong Bahru, a place to immerse and reminisce in art and culture. A must visit for locals and tourists to this unique space. Tiong Bahru is one of the oldest residential estates in Singapore, it has in recent years undergone a renaissance & the area is probably the hippest neighbourhood now."
Degiosart,5,"From the moment you walk into the gallery with its beautiful lighting and harmonious music, you know you have been taken away to a very special place. Beautiful pieces from all over Asia with exhibitions on rotation all the time. The owner Pino is incredibly friendly and lovely.

My favourite part is the collection of vintage kimonos and obis which are then repurposed into modern day pieces.

A must see if you're in Tiong Bahru or Singapore!"
Degiosart,5,"Degiosart Gallery has a very extensive art pieces from paintings, sculptures, vintage items, exclusive artifacts and many more. I recommend you to come along with your family and friends."
Degiosart,5,"Discovered this antique shop by attending a Tibetan carpet exhibition and talk. It is a wonderful place to find great vintage collections of arts,  pre-loved treasures and timeless wearables."
Windsor Nature Park,5,"Beautiful park.
Love the fast flowing stream with full of rare native fish.
Recommended"
Windsor Nature Park,5,"Beautiful and peaceful nature park. Got to see wild boars, monkeys and a rare kingfisher bird (from a distance). An enjoyable and cooling walk early in the morning just after a shower."
Windsor Nature Park,5,It was raining when we went for a walk but it was good because there's no crowd. The walk ways are easy and clean until the path going to Tree Top walk. It was closed by the way but we still had fun and enjoyed the walk.
Windsor Nature Park,5,Easy to hike. Many sign and helpful people around. Got monkey and all kind of nature animals. Ahahahaa.. bring a brolly if u can for unexpected rain.
Windsor Nature Park,4,It's a nice place for a nature trail walk. Paths are well defined with signs guiding the way. Do wear proper shoes if you wish to enjoy your walk. Did not see any monkeys but I seen a few squirrels. 😄
Windsor Nature Park,4,"It's a nice park with many doable trails for a younger family. You can take 15 min to 60 min. Parking is free and there's lotsa lots (but do come early). Do not recommend strollers, as there are sections which are not suitable. Shaded walkways by the high foliage. Saw couple of monkeys and squirrels.

As the hike was pretty quick, we actually continued all the way to Macritchie Park. Doable with my boys."
Windsor Nature Park,4,Love the nature.  Lots of monkeys! Don't feed them
Windsor Nature Park,5,"Fantastic venue to relax and enjoy nature after hunkering down at home. You can follow the easy boardwalk trail or the lessor known natural trail .

Cool place..in all senses!!"
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,Awesome nite ride with awesome view of the nite lights from the background office buildings...!!
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,"Nice place for a walk. View is good and it’s windy.

My doggos approve👍🏼"
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,Love this spot in Singapore - after a bike ride in the morning for a short break or evening after a walk. Lovely views
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,I love this area for taking photo. Very cool place indeed 😎
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,You can enjoy beautiful night view.
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,Can you see the full moon? A place to chill with your friend and enjoy the peace and tranquil.
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,The place to enjoy the skyline!
Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade,5,"I consider this a must-visit in Singapore! Stroll around the marina and take in views of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel, quirky and artistic little landmarks like the Whirlpool, and sit and people watch.
The views from this area at night, with the city lit up and stretched out all around you, are stunning - but I also loved coming here early in the morning, before the crowds arrived, and seeing the sunrise over the water."
Jurong Frog Farm,3,"The farm itself is easy to find, and they do try to make it interesting and interactive for kids. However, it's a pretty small farm with just a couple of posters here and there, and without a guide it's not really clear what's happening. Staff was also a bit gruff when we were there.

Perhaps if we'd gone in a bigger group, or on a less rainy day it might've been a little more fun.

That said - be prepared for many MANY frogs. Tanks and tanks full of frogs."
Jurong Frog Farm,1,"Completely rundown. After such high star ratings it was unexpected to arrive at a dirty, unkept place. This place could be a wonderful educational resource if only better kept. I would certainly not bring school trips here which is an absolute waste. Do better!"
Jurong Frog Farm,4,"The Royal Frog Farm is a fun place to take kids! We thought he might be a bit scared of the frogs, but he surprisingly wasn't! It's also geographically very close to Hay Dairies, so made for a nice half day out with the little ones."
Jurong Frog Farm,5,"Clean farm with many spots for good pictures. A large variety of frogs to observe and interact with, that are very well-tamed. Although the farm is quite small, it delivers on its promise of frogs.

Restaurant was abit on the pricey side, but the quality of the meat and other foods was commendable.

Location is quite inaccessible without a car, as the nearest bus stop is about 1km away.

Good place to visit with kids, as they are allowed to pick up and pet certain frogs."
Jurong Frog Farm,3,"Nice place to drop by if you're on your way to Hays goat farm. However all activities need to pay for, even for simple stroking of the frog.
The place is also on the dirty and damp side which results in mozzie manifestation. Mozzie spray is a must here."
Jurong Frog Farm,4,Son loves to catch frog.
Jurong Frog Farm,5,"Good place to learn about frogs. Might look a bit disgusting for some, but the place is relatively clean despite the moisty 'ponds' for the frogs. It's a good thing that children can witness by themselves the stages of transformation of a tadpole to a frog (and see their eggs as well)"
Jurong Frog Farm,2,"I don't know if all the people who write such positive reviews have been to another place. The Frog Farm is totally run down. There were only frogs in about three or four enclosures. Among them dead animals. The whole area, except the shop, is run down and looks like a dump. It's absolutely incomprehensible that no one cleans it up. As the owner, I would be ashamed to receive visitors. As a teacher, I would never take my students there, or as a parent, my children.
It's a shame because it would be good if there were more places in Singapore where children could learn about animals, where students could be in direct contact with animals."
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),5,"One of the most seeing destinations around CQ.  Beautiful view and just at the center of everything.

We used to come there for pre drinking  or picnic while ago. Since IT is one of the places  where you can drinks on Public  till 22.00 pm as I heard ( ...)

Nowadays just empty and a few entrances are closed  !

looking forward for reopening!

cheers!"
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),4,Great scene in the evenings. Cool lights
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),4,The view is so beautiful here. There are many cafe and pubs around here.
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),5,"Full sent it off this bridge into the Singapore River. I enjoyed the beautiful swim, water wasn't too cold or too hot. Definitely would come back again for this phenomenal experience, thank you Singapore and Clarke Quay!"
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),5,Gets a lot of people but not crowded. Best to visit at night to see the lights and the drinks shining.
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),3,"An ordinary crossing bridge, but the view and ambience is great!!"
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),4,"This would be a typical bridge 🌉 if not for the colorful lights if Clarke Quay. When I passed through here, there were a duo of guys singing, groups of European hanging out, and couples enjoying the romantic ambiance of the bridge."
Read Bridge　(Malacca Bridge),5,'Malaccan Village Bridge 'as it was located where the original Kampong Melaka or' Malaccan Village 'once stood. The Bridge often crowded with teenagers / youths staring at the scenes of the Singapore River. It is crowded mainly by the nightlife activities.
Rumah Bebe,4,Walked past this really beautiful peranakan restaurant. Rather small so I think you would need luck to see if there is seats. Not sure if it can be booked. Staff are really friendly and family like. Food is okay and especially loved the ayam nua kelat. Would say 4 stars for food but 5 stars for ambience.
Rumah Bebe,4,"You can’t miss this uniquely authentic peranakan restaurant when strolling down this street!
A list of what we got, starting from my top picks:
1. Ayam Bueh Keluak: think tender fall-off-the-bone chicken bathed in a gravy packed with umami flavors so good that we had to drench our rice in it, down to the last drop. The buah keluak nuts were done so well - dig out the kernels with the tiny forks provided and be rewarded with molten chocolatey goodness!!
2. Nasi ulam: it’s a hard dish to master as many spices are needed to create the perfect taste. I loved how their rendition was marked by the aroma of lemongrass which at the same time didn’t overpower the more subtle flavors. Even nicer when eaten with the ABK sauce above lol.
3. Sambal lady’s fingers: was a substitute for chap chye which wasn’t available. Not bad, I liked the sambal.
4. Kueh pie tee: interesting, their turnip filling is PACKED with a chock full of ingredients. Slightly saltier than what I’m used to.
5. Babi pongteh: surprisingly not to my liking. The cut of pork was very fatty and could’ve been more tender. Gravy was saturated in little semi-disintegrated bits of potato and was...potato-ey.
6. Laksa goreng: the bean sprouts were too overpowering - we suspect it is because the roots were not plucked off.
And no peranakan meal is complete without desserts! I’ve been here twice and here’s what I got:
1. The kueh salat here is THE BOMB - the kaya layer, which was the right level of sweetness, was smooth like custard from the heavens and adhered well to the fluffy and lightly salted sticky rice. Durian salat was fine, although the custard layer was not as mine blowing as the original.
2. Apom Bokwar: no idea how to spell this but it’s a little Indonesian pancake that you dip into the saucer of warm banana sauce!!
3. The western cakes were very normal and felt a little heavy."
Rumah Bebe,4,"This place sort of catches your eyes when you are walking pass it. This is largely due to its colourful decoration. Came to this place wanting to visit its museum but ended up having lunch here instead. The museum was undergoing renovation and would only be ready in 1st wk of April 2021.
The menu choices was not that great maybe they were having renovation works. But what’s on menu that day were all authentic Peranakan dishes. We got the Ayam pongteh and chapchye. The food were all served in pretty colourful Peranakan plates. Food was so flavourful, especially the chapchay. It was my 1st time eating the buahkalet. Had an interesting time digging out the contents in the nut.
Will definitely return again to try other dishes and visit the museum!"
Rumah Bebe,5,"Beautifully decorated place that’s so vibrant and eyecatching you literally cannot walk past without giving a second look. The exterior can serve as a photoshoot spot on their own. They focused on showcasing peranakan culture and even the owners dress in traditional outfits.

They serve lunch daily with a rotation menu (dishes starting from about $6.60 for laksa to $15 for sharing plates), as they can only fit a group up to four in a table, do call them to reserve beforehand at the timing you wish (they are quite flexible). Will definitely try it out someday. You can also buy some kuehs/ jams / sauces."
Rumah Bebe,5,Food on weekends is amazing. They offer different specials and there isn’t much dining space. But every visit thus far has been more than worth it. One of our go-to places for a hearty lunch.
Rumah Bebe,4,"If you want to taste on traditional south-east Asian cuisines, you come to this right place. Remember to book a seat in advance to avoid a long waiting time for a table."
Rumah Bebe,5,Lovely traditional peranakan lunch near to Katong Plaza. Highly recommended.
Rumah Bebe,5,Always order in advance. Love fresh taste of buah keluah and many desserts. So yummy until craving. The belachan is super thick really rare in singapore jem
The Untamed Paths,5,"I have booked with Seek Sophie a number of times and I have found their professionalism and help to be excellent. On top of which, I found many of their experiences to be unique and help me see another side of Asia (especially Singapore during the pandemic).

Highly recommended.

Mark"
The Untamed Paths,5,"Reliable and professional with highly curated set of activities

Enjoyed the kayaking trip we booked with Seek Sophie. Booking was easy and they provided great customer service leading up to the trip. Also booked a sound bowl meditation class which had to be rescheduled due to covid restrictions and they were very helpful in contacting me with updates and rescheduling."
The Untamed Paths,5,"I've booked three activities through Seek Sophie - one in Indonesia and two in Singapore. With all three bookings, the team was very responsive and even accommodated our (extremely) last minute changes to our Indo booking. Would definitely recommend esp. if you don't have a fixed itinerary and are generally up to explore fun stuff"
The Untamed Paths,5,"Before COVID, Seek Sophie was my go-to channel for finding off-the-beaten-track experiences across Southeast Asia with the most passionate and experienced local guides. During COVID, it’s turned into the single best source of finding unique experiences in Singapore. From abandoned bunkers to rooftop gardens to essential oils, Seek Sophie has kept us sane and fulfilled!"
The Untamed Paths,5,"Great customer service, effortless process, highly recommended!"
The Untamed Paths,5,"I did a pottery class via Seek Sophie, and it was such a fun experience. Response to my questions were very fast, and especially amenable/flexible to my changes (considering it’s COVID period with lots of last minutes rules from the Govt). The teacher was really informative, and shared a slice of SG I don’t get to see often- despite being singaporean myself. Quite a seamless experience from start to end."
The Untamed Paths,5,"I just spent two weeks in Bali and had an amazing time with the help of the Seek Sophie staff! It was my second time in Bali and this time I wanted to get off the beaten path. With the help of Seek Sophie, I managed to do just that! It was super easy to find activities and guides on the site and the staff provided me a ton of suggestions on what to do and where to go when I let them know the type of trip my girlfriend and I wanted.

We went on three separate trips with Seek Sophie's recommendations: 1) hiring a driver for day of off the beaten path sightseeing (amazing food and beach stops with Justin, the best driver ever!), hiking up Mt.Batur at sunrise and avoiding all the normal crowds, going with a surf camp that helped me catch my first waves. All our guides and drivers were super knowledgeable about the different areas of the island and spoke great English.

Normally I like to plan everything and do a ton of research beforehand to find the best deals for activities but I found the prices that the prices on the Seek Sophie site were a lot better than the prices on the ground. I would highly recommend going through their platform to book your next trip!"
The Untamed Paths,5,"Great 4 hours
Great Captain- Mr Sergio"
Jubilee Walk,3,Beautiful architecture along the Singapore River walk
Jubilee Walk,4,we did a short version from Boat Quay to Helix bridge. It was a refreshing walk filled with lovely architecture and relaxing as you could sit down to enjoy the various points of interest. Best if you start in the late evening just before sunset and continue until all the surrounding is lit up. You will get two very different and equally satisfying views.
Jubilee Walk,5,"Beautiful walk, especially at night."

Millenia Walk,4,"Visited this great Bavarian restaurant on their opening day, a Saturday to the welcoming surprise of Fruhshoppen. Would have taken up the challenge of a delectable Saturday brunch except that , am alone. Food was great, lovely ambience , gemutliches essen, currywurst smeckt lecker ! A number of diners at 11.15am on the second floor minus the children. The bar was quite full at noontime but only a shadow  of its former glory. The beer was heavenly and tasted nostalgically good. Am looking to another visit when full dining returns."
Millenia Walk,5,"The Millenia Tower and Millenia Walk Retail Mall were built in the mid-1990. Its unique design featuring a series of pyramid domes remains an attraction to the locals and tourists alike. It’s a great place to shop. Among others, there is a Harvey Norman Flagship store there too."
Millenia Walk,5,Day 15 of Phase 2 heightened alert. Hope everything is going to get back to normal soon! 🙏🏻
Millenia Walk,5,"I love this mall, it's quiet, elegant and high quality. Many key flagship stalls operate here. There is a high furniture shop called commune in level 2 that sells chic furniture, Harvey Noman, Meidi-ya is opening their newest supermarket in level 1, together with a liqour shop that sells unique japanese sake. Many nice cafes and restarants on level 1 and some high end audio shops as well."

J-Cube Mall,3,"Less shops and less crowd as well, probably covid effect. Applaud to Daiso, expanding..."
J-Cube Mall,5,Good place to do some shopping. Has good dining options too
J-Cube Mall,3,"A quiet heartland mall that has longstanding history in the Jurong East area. The accessibility in terms of covered walkway from Jurong East MRT is poor (non-existent), you have to bear the rain when crossing from bus interchange. There is a ice skating/hockey rink and a 24hrs gym. Mall is populated mostly by F&B outlets. There are some affordable clothing stalls on Level 2, catered more for students alike."
J-Cube Mall,4,"Jcube is a capitaland mall with free WiFi! The only ice rink in the west of Singapore is located here. There are a lot of entertainment places such as iDarts, iRefresh (massage corner), Neoprints area, Claw machines, etc.! There used to be a lot more retails and restaurants but possibly temporarily/permanently closed due to Covid. Overall, there are still many things around would definitely go for entertainment not so much for the food."
Willow Stream Spa,3,Spacious and centrally located. Generally well maintained despite its age but perhaps a makeover is due. Always provides a relaxing experience.
Willow Stream Spa,4,"I was very tired of this Covid -19 and the work load after that. I was feeling like to go somewhere and relax for few days. But that was not possible during these days.

My friend recommended me about this spa. I read the reviews on Google maps and decided to visit.

Decided to opt for a Day Spa Package. Opted for 'Dream Time' body treatment. The treatment lasted for 90 minutes. Received full body massage with warm stones followed by anti-aging facial.

Felt very relaxed, stress free and refreshed. Thanks team for all your job!

Thinking to get a membership plan. Browse there other services. Worth  checking them

Recommended!"
Willow Stream Spa,4,It's a centrally located place and is part of the fair on hotel in bras basah. They have tennis courts.  Swimming pool. Health club and spa. Which can be booked. You don't need membership.
Willow Stream Spa,1,"My therapist was Kathy Marn, very unprofessional: talked on the phone with her son 3 times middle of massage and disrupted my enjoyment of peaceful times. She apologized with some story of her son taking over her apartment and forcing her to leave blah blah blah... son is billionaire and don't even need this job ... blah blah ... arrhgh."
Willow Stream Spa,2,"Poor service, dated facilities, would not recommend."
Willow Stream Spa,5,Had a facial here and it was a great experience. There was a member of staff looking after me at every point. My facial with Stella was amazing. She knows what she’s doing and is super professional. Would definitely come back!
Willow Stream Spa,5,Used to go to the gym here. Very clean and maintained nicely. Although the decor is becoming a bit dated. The staff are extremely polite and nice! Great shower areas too.

Imbiah Lookout,5,"New station to stop by, not that I recall ....hehe thanks"
Imbiah Lookout,4,Nice destination for tourists
Imbiah Lookout,5,"It has the world famous Madame Tussauds museum. There are also butterfly park, a natural walkway. Merlion plaza and Universal studio are also near. There are some good places to stay nearby, like the Costa sands resort which is also cheap if you want to stay at their cute huts."
Imbiah Lookout,5,"This was maybe the best experience on Sentosa island (save the Aquarium), as I did not expect it.Nice sculptures, nice trees and flowers, perfect lookout. Sentosa's Marlion is also here. A must visit place."
Imbiah Lookout,5,"The Sun, the sand and the sea."
Imbiah Lookout,5,"A very beautiful place in sentosa island having a number of attraction points for tourists. Cable car, luge, skydrive, Merlion statue, pics with parrots, Madame Tussauds museum, butterfly park, movies show etc. are at this pace. All the attractions are at walking distance. Restaurants, restrooms and shopping centre is also available here. Overall a very beautiful place to spend a lot of time ( With or without children)."
Imbiah Lookout,5,"This place is a Cable Car station but has lot of other attractions. Butterfly park, Madame Tussaud museum, Movie Shows, Merlion statue, walkthroughs, etc. are at this station. Restaurants and restrooms and shops are available too. Nice place to spend time."
Imbiah Lookout,4,"Now its so quite and can move around easily
best time to go and have fun
do not wait any longer"
Istana Park,4,"The park I pass by on the bus is a typical city park, rectangular in shape, allowing those working nearby to come and rest. Has the sense of design. A very nice city park."
Istana Park,4,great place for stroll any time..Day or night
Istana Park,5,"Even though there is only a small space, it's very well used, with lots of space to walk around and sit and enjoy the greenary and water."
Istana Park,5,Peaceful park with wandering lanes among tropical trees and flowers. Central area with fountain and gallery. Nice to walk in the evenings as it gets a bit cooler and the landscape lighting glows.
Istana Park,5,Beautiful green space with a small pond along orchard road.
Istana Park,5,"The Istana park is a landmark situated in front of the Presidential Residence, the Istana. Lush greenary and within the Central Area, Singapore's central business district. The Park was completed in 1995. It was designed and built as an extension to the main entrance of the Istana. The park was officially opened on 6 September 1996 by National Development Minister Lim Hng Kiang."
Istana Park,4,A nice place to go for a stroll. Though it’s in quite a crowded busy location. The ambience is nice and quite centrally located. Some nice cafe’s here if you like to try something different in terms of a venue.
Istana Park,4,"Nice little piece of green heaven in the middle of a well-known shopping district. While it is not good for picnics, it is a good place to clear the clutter up in your mind by walking among the kept lush. There are seats if you fancy eating lunch there. And it does provide some shade from the sun and heat."
The Slide @ T3,5,It is a fun experience and we all had to wear mask now when sliding down the slide. There are a lot of kids trying out the slides. The slide has a gate to ensure that only one person slide down the slide at a time. Overall a good experience and I really recommend you to try it out.
The Slide @ T3,5,"Good fun for kids above 130cm tall. Some patience needed to queue for turn. Sometimes short sometimes Long. Safety warnings are placed at the entrance, but some parents flout it. But please, don’t jeopardise your kids safety for a mere few seconds of fun. Have fun , but be safe. Enjoy."
The Slide @ T3,5,"Great for entertaining the kids while the parents drink coffee, eat snacks and stone at the cafes right beside it. So we can still keep an eye on them. The children had a great time doing it dozens of time. The best thing.... it’s FREE!!! Yay!!!

There’s a taller slide but you’ve to pay for it. The shorter one is good enough for the kiddos."
The Slide @ T3,4,"Fun!! Worth a try..

Takes you back to school days.. slide is nice & safe.. suitable for adults.. a good activity to engage all at Changi airport.."
The Slide @ T3,2,Not as exciting as it looks. The slide is not smooth. Thus the speed cannot be fast. Easily get stopped on the way down. There are two slides. One is only one floor high and the other is three floors high. The three floors high slide requires minimum height is 130cm
The Slide @ T3,4,"Kids always have fun at the slides. The shorter one starts at B1 and the taller one starts at level 2 (if my memories are correct)
The shorter one is free for all but the taller one requires coupons to play."
The Slide @ T3,5,Fun experience
The Slide @ T3,4,"The shorter slide is suitable for children with at least height of 110cm, the taller slide must be at least 130cm tall. There is also a playground just beside for children to play too."
Ola Beach Club,4,"So far the beach club with the best service and cleanliness. Super friendly and attentive staff, toilets are clean, food was ok! Their signature cocktails were pretty decent. And their poke bowl was HUGE"
Ola Beach Club,3,"Not a bad place to chill with activities. There’s a small pool and offer SUP, banana boat. We didn’t try the activities so cannot comment if we’ll organized.

However, I would skip the food. Bland and it’s not a place for food."
Ola Beach Club,5,"Foods are nice! The unicorn is belong to the club so all ppl can use it, very cute"
Ola Beach Club,5,"Salute to the Helpful staff who helped me safeguard my HP that I misplaced  at the restaurant. She even help me charged it at own initiative when she saw it’s low batt. Super thoughtful !!

To top it off, the food was great, ambience awesome and friendly service !!
We Cannot wait to visit again 👍"
Ola Beach Club,5,"Sometime in April I visited Ola beach club and there were certain issues which I highlighted. The club promptly responded to me and went over and above to rectify our previously negative experience, and made my family's subsequent visit today spectacular.

The food and service was impeccable and they were so kind as to help get a cake for my grandmother's birthday even though they don't sell whole cakes.

The virgin margaritas (cos grandma doesn't take alcohol) were slurped up one after the other, and the pizza disappeared before it had time to cool.

Above all, I'm impressed with how service oriented and genuinely eager they were to make up for their previous mistake. Ola, you have found yourself a loyal customer who will definitely be back.

Thank you for making my grandma's 81st birthday so very very special."
Ola Beach Club,4,Swimming pool is slightly smaller than other neighbouring beach clubs. Service was still alright as we were able to get someone rather quickly though it was pretty busy. Surprisingly the Wagyu burger was awesome. Love the vibes & chill!
Ola Beach Club,4,Overhaul beach setting was brilliant and the water warm.stayed for the sun set with tequila Sunrisers.Tower beers the way to go.Food a disapointment.stay with beer snacks then you will be OK.
Ola Beach Club,3,"Their breakfast is not bad . The portion quite big 😋
Outdoor seat have a view of Sentosa beach"
NUS Museum,5,"Interesting varied exhibitions which are certainly worth a visit.

I really enjoyed the Vietnamese painter's exibit, portrayed through a war time lens on the 2nd floor. Also the combined Chinese dynasty and Singapore artefact laboratory on the Ground floor."
NUS Museum,4,"Pretty good and varied exhibits. Not crowded. Only annoyance is the silly check in and registration process on top of the regular TraceTogether. C’mon NUS, at least make it less onerous. Thankfully the staff are very helpful."
NUS Museum,4,Free admission. Please have a look if you are in the area. We'll done put with great pieces on show
NUS Museum,5,Very nice museum. The best thing about this place is the low number of crowd / visitor. My kids feel very free walking around and staying for a long time at any exhibit
NUS Museum,5,Super cool motorcycle museum ever. Don't miss. You need more than one hour to see all of a thousand bike and stuff. 😁
NUS Museum,4,"Some of the write ups are excellent. Exhibits are not bad as well.
However, information brochure given to me was outdated and place was way too quiet. (I was the only visitor in the entire museum.)"
NUS Museum,5,Interesting SEA collections
NUS Museum,5,Peaceful place
Queensway Shopping Centre,4,328 laksa is amazing. Good to come here if you want the occasional shoe deal also. Maybe not the latest shoes but good deals. Quite a few tennis and badminton themed shops too. Have those steel toed boots shops as well. Can find good deals on past season football/soccer jerseys as well.
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,Get restring my tennis racket in Gala Sports @01-33. Boss is professional and friendly. Recommend.
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,Little changed since the 80s. Great to have it still around - owner operated shops with personal service. Not like the new shopping malls. Well known for sports goods.
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,Cheap and good sports wear. All good quality abs service.
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,So many sport shoe shops! I love the curry chicken and Laksa too.
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,"Structurally, it the same outlook from generations. The shops are as old as before. But what amazes this place, the foods are always new, latest and easy to find. Good management on Safety and checks upon entrance. This is actually a MAGICAL shopping centres in Singapore. One of the earliest."
Queensway Shopping Centre,5,So glad that the building still stays. The toilet looks new though perhaps just renovated. The entire shopping centre is clean and the shops are pretty much the same. You can bargain for your purchases here.
Queensway Shopping Centre,4,Place to visit for reasonable and good quality sports equipments
Paya Lebar Square Retail,4,"Good number of dining options available. Other than restaurants, Giant & few retail stores are available which help ppl run daily errands. Easily accessible too."
Paya Lebar Square Retail,5,Lots of food choices at a reasonable cheap price. Also supermarkets and value store are at the mall.
Paya Lebar Square Retail,5,Good place for meal but the Aircon not cooling especially in the afternoon.
Paya Lebar Square Retail,5,"A lot of nice food, medicures, massages etc"
Paya Lebar Square Retail,5,Not so crowded in e morning.
Paya Lebar Square Retail,1,L1 is a sauna it's so hot. very poor selection of restaurants. I might try the food court in basement if they bothered to cool it.
Paya Lebar Square Retail,5,Wheelchair accessible and alots of foods and shopping centres
Paya Lebar Square Retail,3,3.5 Star. Newer and with some nice food shop. MRT station here also. Nice place to stop and grab snack.
Bedok Jetty,5,"Great walk along East Coast. Beedok Jetty was busy with anglers relaxing/picnicking  with friends & family, patiently waiting for the fish to bite! Also came across colorful parrots getting their Sunday morning outing at East Coast Park"
Bedok Jetty,5,"Makes for a great pitstop during evening runs/jogs/walks, or just a nice place to enjoy the sea views. Usually nice and windy, it also has a few covered shelters in case it starts raining. This is also frequented by many as a catch-and-release fishing spot. Overall, a perfect place to view the morning or evening sun, or just to take in the sea breeze."
Bedok Jetty,5,"Great place to be! Fresh air with lots of space for everyone. Fishes, rainbow, what more can you ask?"
Bedok Jetty,4,"It's crowded ah. Nice ah. But crowded ah. Maybe cos I go during peak hour ah. But nice ah can see sunset. Careful when turning in while cycling cos the path is quite narrow and you need to do like a sharp turn.

A lot of activities here. People seem to like fishing and just chilling. And cycling la"
Bedok Jetty,5,Great place to chill at night! We cycling here using the Anywheel bicycle from the Changi terminal 2. We love being here just to listen to the sound of the waves and the breeze just blew away our tired working days! Definitely a nice place to hangout with friends and family. Saw there is a lot of night walkers coming here to catch fish and bring their own food and lazy chairs here just to sitting there to chitchat and leisurely!
Bedok Jetty,5,"Bedok Jetty is well known for its beautify scenery and fishes. This place is home to the Tamban Fish. It is fun and easy to catch Tamban fish (Herring family). Simply get yourself a Trusty Tamban rig, attached to a rod and you can start catching the fish.

Bedok Jetty is also filled with many other types of fishes. Contra to what many are saying that this place has no fish, it is loaded filled with fishes. Some of the largest fish in Singapore are caught here at bedok Jetty. Big catches here include Stingrays and large Garoupas and Snappers. You just need to be patient and use the correct lures and Fishing Rigs."
Bedok Jetty,5,Great place to go fishing with kids. You'll likely catch very small fish which can be thrown back in.
Bedok Jetty,3,One of the iconic spot at East Coast Park. Popular with anglers.
Robinsons The Heeren,5,"After 160 years in Singapore, Robinsons Store finally closed it doors due to the pandemic. Will be sadly missed by us Singaporeans as they were one of the best store with many well known brands of goods from cosmetics to home appliances etc etc.
Went there two days ago for my last visit and manage to buy a nice pair of pants at a very good discount due to their closing down sale. Wish they will come back again into our shopping lives when things get better..."
Robinsons The Heeren,3,"The store is closing. Queues started at 10am on 31st October when the store opens at 11am.

All throughout the day, there is a visible queue of about 50 pax. The lines loves though

Most shelves are empty. Not much sales.

Important to note, if you have vouchers and giftcard, you'll need to spend double the amount to fully utilize your value. E. G. If you have $50 giftcard, you need to spend $100 ($50 gift card, & $50 cash or credit card etc)

The offer they have now is $30 off $200 spend or $20 off $150"
Robinsons The Heeren,1,"Managed to grap a natural cotton bolster for mom..having a tough time looking for a good authentic one. Hope this is it...o no, mom says it is not the one."
Robinsons The Heeren,5,"Lovely 5 storey- shopping mall with beautiful lights decorated indoors. Nice ladies shoes and handbags range, lovely to shop at 3pm, away from the usual after work crowd. 5th floor - nice bedding and accessories for home decor. Would recommend."
Robinsons The Heeren,3,Another department store bites the dust.
Robinsons The Heeren,3,Prefer Robinson Raffles city
Robinsons The Heeren,2,Such a long queue even before the store opens at 11am. Not really a clearance sale as most of the brands have taken back their stock.
Robinsons The Heeren,5,Great service. Staff with good product knowledge. Good quality products.
The Rink,5,"The Rink is a very lively place where many enjoy the speed and coolness of skating.

Now you would need to book online if you wish to visit the Rink.

It's also entertaining to watch many people skating.

Rates are reasonable. Staff are competent.

Remember to bring jacket when you are there.

#ILoveTheRink"
The Rink,5,"Ice-skating is another activity you can do if you want to do something different in Singapore. The Rink is an Olympic-sized rink and holds classes and public skating sessions.

The Rink recently set up an online booking system that has made booking a slot quite easy. You can rent a locker (2 dollars in coins) and skates and spend a couple hours skating. There is also a resting area if you get tired of skating. Since this place is located in the JCube, you can go shopping or grab a meal right after."
The Rink,4,"Remember to check the website for the Public Skating schedule so that you won't be disappointed. May need to go down early to buy tickets and book slot. My kids didn't really enjoy it though, maybe too young to appreciate. But it's good exposure for them and there are skating aids for them to help them skate somewhat. 🤭"
The Rink,5,"Fabulous ice. Great LTS classes that offer newbies to learn skating and new skaters learn basic footworks for skating and to consider taking up advance courses like - Figure Skate, Ice-Hockey or Short Track Speed Skating. If not, just skate for leisure, to enjoy the momentum gliding on ice and for those who love the cold! ❤️"
The Rink,4,Nice place to experience some low temperatures over the weekend. The organization is good and efficient. However the ice skates for renting are quite old so don't have too much expectations about this.
The Rink,4,"It was an amazing first ice-skating  experience for my frds and I. We were terrified initially as it was hard to coordinate our body movements esp when  the floor was so slippery. With much perseverance, we slowly gotten the momentum and began to have fun. For a beginner, a skating aid would definitely help a long way. We'll be back---The Rink!"
The Rink,3,Best rink in Sg. Friendly And helpful staff except attitude of certain of them has much room to improve. Ticket booking system is not so friendly ad you need to book your slot a few days earlier especially for Friday night and weekend.
The Rink,5,Being a first timer to ice skating. I enjoyed my time. We were lucky to get in as it was weekday. Otherwise booking beforehand is necessary. Please check on their page for the public skating time slots. The rink has the right quantity of people so there is enough room for learners too.
Waterfront Promenade,5,"This area is a place that easily allows you to place yourself in the setting of a movie scene, enjoying a perfectly relaxing stroll, taking brilliant pictures or just sitting and observing in awe of the architecture and city views Singapore has to offer.

It's a great place to catch a beautiful sunset with yourself or with a loved one before dinner in the area, while enjoying the calm breeze over the river.

As the sun sets and the sky darkens, the many skyscrapers ahead of you across the river will illuminate and open a new chapter of picture perfect moments for the night. If you're up for a long stroll, there's a light show available at Marina Bay Sands in the later part of the evening starting from approximately 8:45."
Waterfront Promenade,5,"Best walks! beautiful views! instagramable! different ambience during the day and night!

I love that place! Used to jog around every evening! ITs spacious and windy! easy to access via bayfront or  suntec side!

Always a good times!

cheers!"
Waterfront Promenade,4,Nice waterfront.  A good place to take a walk and enjoy the sight.  Clean park.  Nice refreshment stands.
Waterfront Promenade,4,"This is one of the best city view area for Singapore. You can view and feel the best CBD of Singapore, with your camera you can have the whole marina bay in one frame of your photo."
Waterfront Promenade,5,"You wouldn't say you've been to Singapore if you don't walk around the Marina Bay. Being one of the best night cityview scenery in Asia, you'd feel happy just by walking along while feeling the dazzling atmosphere here. Along your walk there are many things nearby which may be attractive to you: grand shopping malls, inflatable park, glamorous bridge, vivid carnival, great bars, food stalls, outdoor theatre...

If you're a Singaporean please treasure this place since I really envy you for having it!

A little tips: no one would bother if you cross the ""no authorizied entry"" area to reach the tip of the wooden floor, at the edge of the bay, for a nice shot, at least in my case... It's just a piece of info for your reference and I do not bear any responsibility for your actions, though!"
Waterfront Promenade,5,"This is a nice area to take a stroll and enjoy the surrounding views or just marvel at some of the amazing structures that are accessible. The promenade is some 3.5km in length, we maybe strolled one kilometer enjoying the sights of impressive buildings, the Marina Bay Hotel, activities on the bay, some nice shade areas, but we finally yielded to the 39c heat and high humidity and headed to the Mall for some A/C comfort. City planning with vision."
Waterfront Promenade,5,Gorgeous bay view here.
Waterfront Promenade,5,Fantastic place for photos with the Singapore skyline and the merlion in the background.
Fort Siloso,4,Interesting place to explore for a little bit of history. Surrender room shows a reenactment of both the british and then the japanese surrender.
Fort Siloso,4,"Extremely informative. I would recommend visiting with your family. They have interactive learning devices and even wax figures to help you understand more. Due to COVID 19, it is completely free and the shuttle bus service is much more frequent. There isn’t much crowd and it is really fun.
They have tunnels and bunkers as well. You can explore every nook and cranny.
They have also paid respects to soldiers from different cultures and ethnicities.
They have planted a war garden which shows all the plants they used during the war.
Overall, I loved this place and would recommend for you to visit"
Fort Siloso,4,"Nice day out, and totally free! Exhibits aren't in great condition, but it is free so you can't complain. Educational if you don't mind reading a bit. Lots of interesting history about Singapore in WW2. Good escape from the city, surrounded by nature."
Fort Siloso,4,Not a fan of the history here but it was definitely a nice place to walk about. I like the painting on the road and the stones. It is clever of them to do that.
Fort Siloso,5,Fantastic walk through of Fort Siloso and also getting some facts straighten out like the cannina actually were not placed wrongly and was used. The Sky Walk is breezy and like the coastal view of the oil and gas Islands and cargo ships around.
Fort Siloso,5,Nice educational walk with great view. There is also a nature walking trail nearby.
Fort Siloso,5,"Well worth checking out.

Free, fun chance to explore the area and exhibitions which provide interesting historical perspectives on the stories being told.

If you're walking, the SkyBridge entrance is probably where you want to aim for initially. Cyclists - Bikes can be parked up near the main entrance a little further up the road, so probably easiest to explore from this entrance onwards."
Fort Siloso,5,Much more expansive than I expected. I assumed a few artillery emplacements but there was a lot more - from a peek into life as a soldier as well as stories from Japanese occupation. Be ready to set aside more time than you anticipate.
Palawan Beach,5,Beautiful place.
Palawan Beach,5,Had a great time there. Alas it's REALLY REALLY expensive. i mean everything is expensive there!
Palawan Beach,5,Very beautiful and clean beach. This is a recommendation!
Palawan Beach,4,This place good for bring family or friends
Palawan Beach,5,"Soothing evening point. Chill, relax and njoy sunset."
Palawan Beach,5,"This looks like a lovely place to sit and relax. Many people were swimming in the water.
This is where the rope bridge connects to supposedly the most southern point of continental Asia.
It was a very lovely place to visit."
Palawan Beach,5,Weekdays are perfect for tanning at a quiet beach. Barely anyone there. On a good day.. water is beautiful.
Palawan Beach,5,"It’s such a beautiful beach. As usual, many activities at the beaches like swimming, sunbathing, playing games. That’s an awesome place to watch sunset."
MacRitchie Reservoir,4,Went for running(tired but healthy and peaceful)
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,"Very good place for walk, running, jogging and many more ."
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,so stunning and nicely kept. best place for running. Multiple trails to choose from. Not a lot of trash either. 10/10 would recommend. Can get busy on weekends.
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,"We did Macritchie to Bukit Timah Nature park trail. Fresh air with good scenic views. It took 3hrs for us to complete, but it depends on individual fitness levels. We came across monkeys so be careful with them."
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,Beautiful scenery
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,Great place for walking!
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,Very nice place to visit
MacRitchie Reservoir,5,Nice place for refreshing 👍👍👍
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"After going there for the third time, I have completed all the games they have to offer and all of them were pretty good.

First off, the location was perfect, being right next to chinatown MRT.

Most of the games have you complete individual tasks as a team and are pretty intuitive (aka you don’t need to think too much)

Time travel chapters 1 and 2 requires you to collect alien information capsules in different times and places. Generally it’s about the interactions of the object available to you and using it/ throwing it to your teammates (aka matching the right object to the right place)

Both chapters have a small amount of shooting (projectiles) and are

Are we dead? On the other hand has a more cohesive storyline, with slightly more complex logical connections to make. (It’s still very doable doe). The graphics are very good and nearing the end there’s a lot of gun action.

The games hold up to 4 people max but still works with 2 or more.

This was very enjoyable for me and if they release a new game I’ll be sure to try it out. The only complaint I would have is the lack of ability to move. You can move around in your box that is your room but you just teleport between cutscenes which breaks the immersion a bit (Time travel doesn’t have this problem but Areyoudead does)

(p.s enjoy throwing balls at each other at the start of Time travel)(pps don’t miss the skeleton in a box)

Remember to key in your email to get the photos you took in game to be sent to you"
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"Interesting experience!

We bought tickets online. When we got there, the staff was friendly, explaining about everything. We can put our bags in lockers.
Each person has their own room equipped with a headset and 2 hand controllers. Mouth mask can be taken off during play.

It was our first time and we were suggested to take the easiest level about time travel. Sometimes it took quite some time to find out what exactly we needed to do to achieve something but in the end all ended well. Mission completed 100%!
Would go again to try a different level!"
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,3,"My second time there (on 21 August 2021) was actually disappointing and confusing, but I believe the lackluster service might be due to staffing challenges during the pandemic, because my first visit pre-Covid was great with warm and cheerful and helpful staff.

I recently returned to play their Chapter II game, after a fun experience the first time with Chapter I. At the counter, the two guys seemed very low on energy and listless, and didn't bother greeting me and my partner even though we were polite to them and enthusiastic. They did not give any explanation on how the whole set-up would work (it was my partner's first time there, so he felt lost). The gamemaster just gestured mildly to the lockers to tell me to put my stuff there, but didn't point out to me where the key was and also didn't say what I could or could not bring into the room.

During the game, there were a few technical glitches, which we totally understand for VR games. But whenever we asked for help from the gamemaster, he was listless and seemed distracted, and ignored what we were saying when we were trying to tell him it's a glitch, and not that we didn't know how to solve the puzzle. There were a lot of silences where we were just doing nothing and waiting for him to reply us, or for him to suggest overriding the glitchy parts so we could move on or retry that stage without tech issues. We had to repeat things along the lines of ""yes, but it doesn't work"" or ""yes we already tried that"", when the gamemaster was trying to give us clues on how to solve certain puzzles, but he didn't seem to be paying attention to us so he kept repeating the clues which we didn't actually need. It was frustrating and boring for us.

Finally, at the end of the game, we took some in-game photos. When we exited, the staff apologised for the glitches, but didn't say anything about the photos or the outside IRL selfie photoshoot (which we later saw was closed, presumably due to Covid). I thus asked him if they would send the in-game photos, to which he curtly replied, ""We will WhatsApp to you."" He also didn't say ""bye"" or ""thank you"" or ""see you again"" - so we stood there awkwardly briefly, not knowing if the conversation was over. Well, it's not a big deal, but that was oddly cold service for a business that's highly customer-facing. My first visit was with very friendly staff so I was taken aback by how we were mostly ignored the second time.

Anyway, we never received the in-game photos via WhatsApp or email. I emailed them twice to check on this but didn't receive a reply over the past 1 week plus.

Perhaps the poor service was because they were understaffed. I also understand that many businesses especially tourism/experience based ones are struggling now. And my first visit was, after all, very positive. Therefore I gave 3 stars... Would have been 1 or 2 stars if purely based on my second visit.

I hope the business recovers and the service quality will improve soon, back to how welcoming and fun it used to be. The price point is also very reasonable for this duration of game play. But personally, I doubt I will be going back to Virtual Room to play the final game (Zombies)."
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"It was our first VR experience. We researched what to expect and were excited about the experience. The game master was professional in helping us with our gears and telling us the instructions of the game. As I could not see clearly due to my glasses, the game master had to help me to loosen and tighten the headgear. He was friendly and professional. Overall, the experience was awesome and we are looking forward to our second trip soon! - Vivian & Justin"
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"Really fun and entertaining experience! Go in a group! Was over too soon, would have liked to play more of the games."
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,Good fun activity. It was quite easy to go through the stages but it was still very entertaining. The venue was very very cold but once you get to move around it’s not so bad. It is tucked in a basement of a once flourished mall but it’s not a problem for us to find the place. Highly recommend.
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"Very fun experience! Friendly staff who explained the game well to us. There are 3 levels of game and being first-timers, they recommended that we try level 1 which is about time travelling. I liked the different scenery in the scenes. You have to solve puzzles to get through the missions. I bought the tickets via klook. We will be back to attempt the harder levels!"
Virtual Room: Virtual Reality Singapore,5,"Awesome!! First VR experience for us as a group of 4. I suggest going with 4 people if you can, because working together virtually was soo much fun. We did the first mission and liked it soo much that later that day we did the second one, which was quite a bit harder, so didn't finish! Highly, highly recommended!"
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,"Nice and large area with plenty of sea creatures for observation. The free treat ice-cream is enjoyable for the kids.

While the Ping Fong establishment is nice for photo-taking, not much interactive booths are present and no mascots available as advertised.

As for the MasterCard Exclusive gift, it is just a black dust bag with sea aquarium logo."
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,My first experience at SEA Aquarium.. Most fascinating by the attraction.. Variates of water creatures including the most popular among all.. The Dolphin and the shark.. Total is  around 2hrs ++  to complete the attraction.. Prices for the photo is $50+ so as the globe.. Buy both at $90.. Do bring your families down..
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,"Beautiful place. My first time here. Don't forget to take a professional photo at the entrance in case u wanna purchase it later! Your photo comes in a pretty snow globe and 2 small memory photos for $55. You can also get the full set which includes a huge blown up photo with a free hard cover!

We are locals yet it was fun to purchase the full set as memory! Definitely worth it!"
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,This is the first aquarium I had visited and was awed by the size and structure of the aquarium. The aquarium is very well maintained by the staff. The aquarium was said to be the largest in the world. There were few rare sea creatures such as the Manta Ray and Giant Crab
S.E.A. Aquarium,4,Still an exciting place to go..even though it felt like the number of exhibitions has decreased. Suggest to keep the information on screen longer. It is annoying to get cut off when you're half way reading interesting facts about the species.
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,"Huge aquarium in Sentosa Singapore. Very well maintained, lots of exhibits to keep children and adults amazed for hours. Apart from hundreds of varieties of fishes, there are jelly fishes, crabs, corals, sea horses. Large displays, clear waters, very well designed and illuminated exhibits, information about the creatures on their common names, scientific names and habitat etc, information centre, you have all you want in an aquarium- EduTainment.
In the customary souvenir store at the exit, you can find customized fridge magnets, bottle openers, paintings, scarfs etc to remind you of the visit to SEA Aquarium."
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,Had fun visiting the aquarium! It’s beautiful and took many pictures of the fish tank. An eye opener aquarium for a local. Amazing aquarium with world class collections. So proud of your aquarium and it’s staff customer services. Definitely a must to visit once in a lifetime!
S.E.A. Aquarium,5,"It's nice to go here once in a while to see the beautiful dishes and some mammals.

I wish they'd put more information like posters of sorts near the aquarium to see what kind of fish we're looking at. Interactive screens would be great.

Even on a Saturday morning and using the SRV vouchers, it was very crowded which was great.

Also not sure if it's alright to put like reflective strips at the edge of the aquarium at the bottom side cos it's quite dark and sometimes kids might walk into the aquarium."
Tanjong Beach,5,"So beautiful place!!!

I want to visit there again after pandemic!!!"
Tanjong Beach,4,Rare white sand beach in Singapore
Tanjong Beach,5,Beautiful beach with calm waters.  Ideal for kids and adults. Volleyball courts available on one end.
Tanjong Beach,5,The cleanest of the 3 Sentosa beaches. It is also less crowded and is the perfect location for a family picnic or outing. Many dog lovers came here with their pets for strolls along the beach fronts and enjoy the Sun and sand. It is free entry during the weekdays but you have to book in advance for weekends and public holidays.
Tanjong Beach,5,"White sand beach, swimming allowed, five volleyball courts and there’s Tanjong Beach club.
The last beach before residential area begins and thus least populated. Perfectly serene and really good sunset views. Pre-Reservation is needed and it’s divided into two zones for safe distancing. They’ve demarcated pits so you can put your spread and have a great outing. It’s closed during lightening warning so be prepared to wait 30 minutes then."
Tanjong Beach,5,Very beautiful and super clean
Tanjong Beach,5,Good beach with calm water. Enjoyable with family.
Tanjong Beach,5,Came here on a Friday afternoon and the beach was empty! Definitely a place to recharge and chill when you feel stuck in Singapore and has no where else to go.
Tanjong Beach,5,"This beach is a little far, so less people except the bar. A lot of plays volleyball here, some looks like pros"
Tanjong Beach,5,Had a great time
Tanjong Beach,5,"Perfect on weekdays, away from the hustle and bustle of the city"
Tanjong Beach,5,"Had Fun, Stung by Jellyfish & Scared by Seaweed on the ocean floor & 30 min lightning alert.

Great day"
Tanjong Beach,5,"Beautiful white sand beach in Sentosa .
You can bring your dog along to play or swim but always keep your eye on your dog.

You can bring your own volleyball and play there . It's good for family , couple, groups or even alone.  Quieter than other beach so you  can relax sunbathing

Easy to get there by GPS ."
Tanjong Beach,5,"Is a good place to chill here especially on weekends! Here will be more quieter than the other beaches.

Distance : Will be much further than the others
Environment: Good place to have sunset and chilling
Location : This beach also have a beach club which you can buy drink or food from here.
Transportation: Reachable by shuttle bus or walking (Not recommended)

Definitely will come again for spending my time here!"
Tanjong Beach,5,Cleanest white sand beach among other beaches in sentosa.
Tanjong Beach,5,Beautiful views
Tanjong Beach,2,"Had an enjoyable day with 3 other friends celebrating my furkid's birthday at the club.

PROS:
Day beds and beach with furkids make great photo ops.
Food served is great, good view of the beach and water.
Service staff are attentive and friendly.

CONS:
Food and drinks are relatively expensive, and booking of daybeds require a minimum spend of $100 - $200, depending on if you are booking half or full day.
Due to the need to manage entry-exit, barricades (as can be seen in the photos) are put up blocking direct access to the water. This is rather inconvenient since you will need to wear your mask and bring your belongings to walk around through the main entrance of the beach club to access the beach.
Parasols on daybed are really rather small, and provide little to no cover from the merciless sun during high noon or sudden showers."
Tanjong Beach,5,"As beaches go in Singapore ... This is one of the nicest. Good views, clean beach, and the Beach Club is right next door. Plus there are food trucks from time to time, which helps if you don't bring food."
Tanjong Beach,5,"always a good day  at the beach! volleyball and a fresh air!

I love the sentosa island and will always go there to get some sun and play volleyball and etc!
its a few places to check it out and its a lot of fresh air!

beach is free of charge but if you want to jump at someones pool then You will have to pay!

see you next weekend!"
Tanjong Beach,5,"Safe distancing and management after CB, during Phase 2 - Safe Transition"
Tanjong Beach,5,Very clean beach with very easy transportation access
Tanjong Beach,4,"Away from crowd, best place to chill with family and friends. You can plan your birthday party here and everyone will enjoy.
I went with my family and we really enjoyed a lot. All rules has been following by everyone after COVID-19.
You can find good food at the bar and resto.
Visit once and you will fall in love forever."
Tanjong Beach,4,A very nice beach that's a bit less crowded than other places.
Tanjong Beach,3,Very few shaded spot to hide from the sun. Shoreline is some distance from the nearest carpark. Seems to be a favourite with people into beach volleyball.
Tanjong Beach,5,Awesome place to bring our GR for a swim. Cos we dont want him to get hip problems. Also find many GR friends over here! Fun place!
Tanjong Beach,4,The beach is very clean and the water too. Also great washing facilities. The free tram (bus) made getting to the beach a lot easier. However if you plan to walk it will take 30min+ in the sun.
Tanjong Beach,5,"Fantastic beach on the South Eastern side of Sentosa. It's quieter than other beaches with no restaurants or shops other than Tanjong Beach Club, making for a remote holiday island feel. It's also next to Sentosa Cove, Singapore's most exclusive residential community, so a bit of a wow factor. Also no car access to the beach, adding to the quietness. Well worth a visit."
Tanjong Beach,4,Really awesome view. Friendly bartenders. Front desk employees can have a bit of an attitude at times though.
Tanjong Beach,5,This beach is quieter and more tranquil than siloso and palawan beach at sentosa.
Tanjong Beach,5,Superb
Tanjong Beach,4,"Nice place to chill and play a bit of volleyball. Unfortunately it was a rainy day, we could only stay for about half an hour before it started pouring"
Tanjong Beach,4,"(Translated by Google) The beach is clean, the sand is white

(Original)
Pantainya bersih, pasirnya putih"
Tanjong Beach,5,"(Translated by Google) Very different from the beaches in Indonesia 😅

(Original)
Beda banget sama pantai di Indonesia 😅"
Tanjong Beach,4,"(Translated by Google) Beautiful beach. There is also free wifi available on the beach. However, alcohol and food reflect Singapore prices plus location fees.

(Original)
綺麗なビーチ。ビーチでも無料wifi が利用できます。ただし、お酒、食べ物は、シンガポール価格プラス場所代を反映したものとなっています。"

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Wonderful place, must visit. Felt like 1 day is not enough to complete the visit. Advance booking of the tickets is quite helpful."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"In the new normal, it's required to maintain safe distancing. However during our recent visit, it is disgusting to witness the staff reminding the patrons to maintain 1m within each other but they themselves are not adhering to such rules, especially behind the gaming tables. And it includes the floorpersons as well."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Why do I only give 4 stars instead of 5.
Because the carpark direction signage is simply not comprehensive enough. And ended up parking very far away from the hotel I needed to go."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"I'm not Happy was because of Covid 19, we can't dine in the restaurant, but you can let us bring back the suppers like MBS. we all tired of staying at casino without drinking water and eating for 4 to 5 hours."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Went RWS today on a Weekday, Wednesday. Parking $6 per entry now. Quiet though because of all the restrictions. Cannot wait for it to reopen fully! Missed the Malaysian Food Street food!!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Frankly it is a quiet oasis on the day I visited. Some shops are closed given the lack of footfall.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Covid restrictions being followed. Restaurants are open but number of customers is quite limited.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Staying at Hotel Michael is a perfect place, comfortable.
Food is delicious n I enjoy very much."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Business must be bad here due to Covid. But place is still well maintained. Add to that, sufficient safe distancing ambassadors to ensure people are as safe as possible."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,No overseas! Best places for experience
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Staff were very approachable and helped inform us of the various height limitations. On a side note. The USS app informs you of waiting time. He even advised on how to best use the express pass. Fun filled day for family.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to relax and staying.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Its nice and clean place with choices of  attraction. Walking around sentosa for a day trip was fun! Lots of interesting architecture to see and restaurants to visit.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Overall a great place to explore once in a while but it gets boring pretty quickly. This is compounded with the fact that prices are extravagant for the average Singaporean. For first experience, it is worth it but for subsequent experiences, it gets dull and a bit of a waste in terms of money. Prices aside, the place is perfect for children and families bringing them along. Ranging from beaches, hotels, eateries, exhibit museums, and Universal Studios Singapore, there are many ways to entertain yourself. Although, I would recommend that people bring their own foods or snacks if they were to spend a day there which is the case for most people."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Probably the most unique restaurant in Singapore! I’m not usually a fan of fine dining but this was definitely an exception. My wife and I particularly love animals, including all the beautiful sea creatures that were roaming around. The sights, sounds, and tastes made us really happy that evening. Thank you!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's so quiet ever since Covid-19 happened... The Sentosa beach areas are more vibrant right now.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Love visiting Sentosa! Its always very lively and vibrant. Rediscovering singapore with the government granted $100 credits. Clean and welcoming, polite staff, and safe distancing measures in place."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great way to spend your weekend. Due to pandemic, it is less crowded and you can really take your time to explore the place. Enjoy yourself with family and friends."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One word!AMAZING!Visit the place and ensure to bring your own Sunblock lotion as it is hot during the day😅Love taking photos everywhere,anywhere🥰"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Universal Studio... an enjoyable place for single, couples, teens and families as well. Do factor the queue time for each ride at the theme park. You will enjoy the the dark ride at the Mummies theme area. Shorter queue time after 7pm. Last hour dash for your favourite ride again. Take note, most restaurant closed before 9pm.. However, you may find some restaurants near the Casino opened till 10pm. Enjoy.  The LORD bless you."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great place and one stop shopper of budget is not a constraint, but you can also shop value for money if you are willing to do so"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Love the place. It was huge with many stores and foods, however, price a bit high for the food compared to city area also different type of restaurant here.

USS is here. Fun place to play, but because safety distance measure, the waiting time becomes longer with the same long queue.

The parking is huge as well. It is charged per one time entry. Might be cheaper compared to beach station at $1.2 per hours, depending on how many hours park."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Staff are all very well trained and courtesy especially very courteous with covic 19 safe distancing measure...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Still got a few restaurants open for take away which is good.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The food and the ambience never disappoints me. One of my favourite places to go to for special occasions. ❤
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Our 2nd or 3rd time here. First time was because we bought a stay cation package a few years back. Still like the feel but wished the Universal Studios were a little more affordable for us to visit more often and not to have to try to rush through all the rides in 1 go.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It’s fun and happy place.  Release stress and hang out with friends and family.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Wow Awesome good job excellent classic lovely keep it up
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Overall clear descriptions of locations and signs, toilets are clean, covid measures well put in place, however, if u intend to enjoy there, use your money. If not, its literally free to do nothing there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Thr Go Kart pop up is a good idea. I enjoy the drive very much. Recommend for all family gathering.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Bought the full price tickets for two adults. A bit sad to say the atmosphere inside is not as vibrant as before Covid-19. If you like the rides then most of the more popular ones are still open. But you miss the atmosphere, then you won't find a lot of it there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It half open now but still a good vacation place
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"For now unable to rate high due to pandemic, its a silent world. Resturants and fast food like Macdonalds are open. Sadly the Candilicous store opens Fri to Sun only."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Nice place with walk access to the University Studio. Due to the lockdown, most restaurants only accept take-away.. but still a good choice for staycation during the pandemic."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"It was quiet due to heightened alert, but still a lovely place to visit"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Enjoying sightseeing at Sentosa by walking & taking trams bus around the beautiful island. Good for holiday & relaxing your family & friends.👍
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Very big hotel but convenient with bubble tea store and McDonald's in the basement level. I mean, who needs anything else, haha"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Visited Resorts World Sentosa's Universal Studios together with the family on a weekday! The crowd was decent and the queues are not extremely long (averaging 10mins).

However, we were disappointed that the main attraction (rollercoasters) were not opened that day.

The staff in USS were friendly and approachable, and there were SDA around to ensure the guests are not flouting the safe distancing measures.

One thing I would recommend is for guests to check the weather forecast before visiting to ensure a wholesome experience.

Will definitely visit again!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's a great place n intresting...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,fun.. but alot of attraction is closed..
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Just like in Genting, Malaysia.
But u play with Sing currency.
Casino... If u gamble, play with responsibility.. Good luck."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It was an exciting place to bring yr family members N have fun. However, b prepare to queue at least 40mins for the popular ride ."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Less ppl, good time to spend around"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,If you get the fun pass on klook it's worth it
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good place to visit especially during this covid period. No long Q
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Rws car park at basement has some of it space converted to goal cart. Remind me of the days at downtown east. 28 for nonmember 18 for member for novi e 25km/hr. Real fun experience indoor area
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Good day out. Queues approximately 30 minutes maximum. Snack cart queues were longer! Easy to navigate and plenty of clean toilet facilities.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Staycations destinations with univarsal studios and casino... Have fun.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"We bought the tickets that allowed early park entry which allowed us to eat before the rides started.   Also bought the express tickets which allowed easy access to all the major rides.   I would buy this set up every time....costs more but you don't spend ages in queues.
Everywhere very clean and masks worn by everyone....also safe distancing officers ensure social distancing rules are enforced.
Very well organised and brings peace of mind during these Covid times when you're with your family."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's a perfect place to go to with family and friends 🥺 especially with kids! Go to sea aquarium at 4plus pm on Saturday and it's not very crowded it's an ease to enter and also more space for the kids to run
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place for short family vacation
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Be a tourist of your country, usually pre-covid days it will be jam packed.
As  there is no tourist currently, the shops around here close early"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Very unique place to explore n taking pictures even without own vehicle..so convenient really no excuses for not going
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Had a short staycay with tge family. Room was clean and they have super friendly staff and concierge! The wee one enjoyed his stay.

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"There's good food, there's gambling, lots for the kids to play and easily spending a day or more here."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The Equarius hotel and its staff are amazing ! We really enjoyed our stay ! Thank you very much !
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Now it's free for the monorail to go in sentosa from vivo City. Lots of free activities as well, really a super good place for the weekends. Having fun whole saving wallet as well."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's indeed a beautiful and nice place to visit. Unfortunately covid-19 brings unexpected silence to the place, especially near festive season like Christmas now. Many good restaurants to choose from, some Michelin starred. Wonderful place to stroll around or jogging or cycling. No doubt it's a great place for family gathering."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good to visit 👍 feeling different.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place for a family outing.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I love this place. If you wanna relax weekend don't forget go to this place. Lots of Fun and adventure

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of the best attraction in Singapore. Theme parks, aquarium, good restaurants and casino!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Only for those who's not afraid of heights. But if u are, it's not so bad actually."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Went to Sentosa to take the cable car ride. It was very good. The only problem was there was no normal water available to buy.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Many restaurants and retail are closed for the time being but hope to see a vibrant Sentosa by end of 2021.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Not too crowded. Guess the lack of tourists really hits hard on tourist attractions.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Lesser crowd due to border restrictions, which is good and bad for residents. Easier and faster to get to our rides, but performances and many food outlets are closed."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great service and delicious food with creative names! The lights and atmosphere was magical. Ashley was friendly and humorous! Excellent service provided.
Even the divers were cool and funny. Be sure to wave at them when you visit!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sufyan assisted me at the monorail today, sensed that I needed help and was super helpful despite the unforgiving heat! He was super friendly and had great energy. Thank you Sufyan!"

MacDonald's are existent. Universal studios is also here."

A wide variety of marine animals.
From the humble jellyfishes to the magnificent sandbar sharks."

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Best place in Singapore for holiday 👍
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Too overrated.All those praise and glamour is fake.If you are a tourist,I beg you not to come here"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Was a tad crowded as its the March school holidays. The distancing ambassadors were hard at work to manage the visitors while at the same time providing an enjoyable time for them.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of the top draw for Singaporeans and residents here to visit during this pandemic, going ""oversea"" yet doesn't required passport. There are many great places to offer tranquillity and relaxation of the mind here. It helps you to destress and escape from the hustle and bustle of life in the mainland"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Not much people during weekdays, especially during covid19 period. Some restaurants have closed temporarily.

Great time to take photos without competing with tourists.

The ambassadors are rather vigilant near the USS globe, so if you want a good shot of your ""whole body"", then best to go early when there are no one around. Note that the fog machines are not in operation, so win some lose some I guess."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The resort is not as crowded as before.  Good time to visit.  However,  you've got to be able to remain call as social  distancing measures are in place."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Resorts World Sentosa (Abbreviation: RWS) is an integrated resort on the island of Sentosa, off the southern coast of Singapore. The key attractions include one of Singapore's two casinos, a Universal Studios theme park, Adventure Cove Water Park, and S.E.A. Aquarium, which includes the world's second largest oceanarium.

The resort was developed by Genting Singapore. It was the third most expensive building ever constructed in 2010. The resort occupies over 49 hectares (120 acres) of land.

The grand opening of the integrated resort was held on 7 December 2012, officiated by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place for a staycay
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Could have been better if there are better Shelter...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"So much fun!
Even during this pandemic, it was still fun!! Kudos to USS Singapore 🇸🇬👏🙌"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Been here multiple times. It is always a treat to come here. Very clean and organised with safe distancing ambassadors making sure there is safe distancing but still enjoying the viewing.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Easy to get to RWS by train . HarboutFront mrt station. Free monorail ride to and fro Sentosa/Vivocity. The Luge and SEA Aquarium are a great way to spend time with families and friends.

The Luge is a fun and exhilarating ride on a sitting toboggan. You take the chair lift up ( with bird's eye view) to take your Luge ride.

The SEA Aquarium has many interesting sea animal species, especially the jellyfish with light effects."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Locally we have nice resort though we are not able to go overseas..
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Due to Covid shops were not busy. Nasi Lemak is good
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Very mega but less crowded now due to covid19.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Very small event, can finish viewing very quickly.  Free but need to book in advance.  Appreciate the effort put in for this display"

Resorts World Sentosa,5,really a good place to gamble. headout to the roulette machine and keep on winning
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Clean and fun place for the entire family. Activities catered for all ages across the island. Only downside is it's expensive in there 😅
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Came to RWS to experience the KF1 tiki circuit. Opens till end of May 2021.

Had to wait in line for about 45mins despite having a booking. Place is rather humid and you will likely sweat while karting so dress light and bring water.

Costs about $30 for 10mins on the track, which equates to about 4-5 rounds depending on your speed and skill. May try their other outdoor tracks in the future."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A sparkling n clean environment with entertaining music surrounding the resorts .
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A one time visit in lifetime, a must place to visit"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Still the best place to be. Hide away from the bustling city life. Lovely place to chill amd relax

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Alot of nice place such as Universal studios, Sea Aquarium and good view looking towards Harbour Front."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Went here for new year, had a nice walk from VivoCity through the boardwalk. The train back to the city is also very convenient."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"We came all the way for the ""Circuit Tiki @ Resorts World Sentosa"". Advanced level is required for driving license, nice experience (i was the champion, LOL...). Friendly staffs both from RWS and KF1!"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"A good theme park. To break the boredom, a good outlet.
If bringing an elderly, it is advisable that you bring along a walking stick with a seat attached to help the elderly rest their tired legs. My suggestion."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,8t mowp p.o i her fmy⁸ixi
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Seartom Hostel Bedroom Both Asrifooy Home
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Love this place it is full of activities
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Hotels fancy well stocked
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Enjoy the walk from vivo to Sentosa, going to candaylious for chocolates."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,High class Resorts World Sentosa of Singapore!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"I believe this only happens once in a blue moon. Once again nature call has strike me and I was searching high and low for the nearest washroom at level one. Low and behold I've managed to find one after macdonalds. But to my surprise, the gents washroom was under renovation and the handicap toilet was occupied. There wasn't any clear signs indicating that the washroom will be under renovation.

With much said, I had no choice but to run/hop as the urgency has reached it's peak. It was quite fortunate that this pandemic had save me quite a fair bit as there isn't any crowd. But upon reaching the gents, the peak was unbearable till I had to let go a nature 9 fart which was as loud as players are shouting PICTURE in the casino..Embarrassment set in as a cleaner just walk out and heard it all..

Never will I be stepping into this place after the pandemic.."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A must go. .you will spend quite a bit though but..its a Resort World in Singapore's most famous island with super 5 stars hotels and resorts, the Universal Studios, the Luge..and everything that is fun for the young and old..."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Ridiculous customer service. Uncontactable and everything is by slow mail. Unable to change bookings easily and they do not respond nor reply to emails. Ended up with lost reservations, wasted tickets and staffs who do not bother to help!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Resort feel. Like it
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Very crowded despite crowd control as claimed by USS. We actually had to book slots for the day that we went through the RWS website but when we got there, it was so crowded. Every ride (not exaggerating) was a 90 min wait on average. Very disappointed. If you decide to go, consider getting an express pass. We didn't as we found it too expensive for a big family like ours."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"I was shocked of the development of the Sentosa Island. The last time that I was there, was during the 90th.Alot of changes that took place and some of the landscape looked different from last time, that I could not recognize it any more. I also saw a lot of  on going construction in progress.Thank you Resorts World Sentosa for keeping  up with progress and making Singapore number One for tourist destination."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,It was a disaster with the rain. Not all assets were deployed against the number of people let in. 3 to 4 rides max from 2pm to 9pm. Expect at least 70 minutes for popular ones. Probably a last.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Only here because of Quarantine. :) The food is good and sponsored by gahman. 🤪 The hotel room is great to be honest. At least there is a balcony for me to breath in some fresh air rather than stuck indoors for the whole 14 days of quarantine.
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"My stay at the Festive Hotel here on Sentosa was part of Singapore's imposed 14 day quarantine. If I had my choice, I would never stay there again. The room was poorly lit...I killed 3 roaches in my bathroom. The food served was cold for each meal. All together a terrible experience that I had to pay for."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,A beautiful resort with many attractions.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great place to spend a fun day. There are so many options available to choose from (eg. Universal Studios, Sea Aquarium, Adventure Cove, Beach activities etc); or one can chill and have a picnic on the beach."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Overall was a great experience. There are a lot of restaurants and shop. It was a good break for anyone who like to staycation and have a different day from work.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Wonderful place! Amazing 👏
Resorts World Sentosa,4,d once packed n bustling RWS is now quiet n somewhat deserted after CB. Opening hours were adjusted n some were even closed. I enjoy d peace n quiet as for once I can really get to see d shops up close.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Rides' experience are great in general. Although you can see some aging in the facilities, overall they are still quite well maintained and polished compared to some other old theme parks. Would have given 5 stars if not for the unpleasant encounter with a staff that told me to not come USS again since I ""complaint"" about the technical delay. To be fair, I was just stating the fact that I experienced two technical delays in a very neutral way. Shocked that it was taken personally."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Love the place 🤗
Resorts World Sentosa,5,First class resort to stay here for me and my family.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Went recently. Other than the long queues everything is good. Crowd was lesser after 5+ hence total manage to get 8 rides for the day. Brought the 2 tix using the voucher so there are 2 meals vouchers icecream sandwich n nuggets for adults n kids. Sci-fi Transformer ride was closed due to technical issues. The 4d shrek was closed due to covid19. Overall super cool n fun to being family there as the atmosphere is so happy there
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Nice place for a family outing, but it's a little expensive. But once in a while you spend a little more it's worth it, recommended."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Undoubtedly one of the most important place to see in Singapore... Good for family and friends outing.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice place to stay hotel but only there not much halal food...

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Many attractions,restaurants to visit. Suitable for family,esp children. Moving around is easy and convenient.
1 stop away from vivocity if one likes more food options."

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Had a pleasant staycation in Hotel Michael. The reception staffers were really nice and attentive. Room was sizeable and comfortable. If you're out to explore - wear comfortable shoes and outfit. Don't forget water. Do check with each restaurant that does not have certificates if they are halal / kosher friendly. Currently the amusement park only operates on Thurs to Sun from 2pm to 9pm so do plan your day accordingly.

Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place is so beautiful sun set is amazing
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Genting group's family oriented integrated resort. Houses several boutique hotels, Universal Studio Singapore, Aquarium, and Casino.

You could not ask for more."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"I stayed in hotel Michael, its a comfortable night, the staff are polite  efficient and instructions are very clear. The room is comfortable and clean. The only short coming is the curtains have already turned mouldy but not cleaned or replaced."

Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Spending your Holiday to Singapore, it's incomplete if you haven't come here. if you go to Singapore using tour & travel services, surely all tours & travels will include this place in their list of tourist destinations. Likewise, if you go with a partner or friends, this place will also be one of the tourist destinations that you choose. this place is one of the favorite places for local and foreign tourists.
It is not difficult to get here, especially in today's digital transformation era, it is very easy to find information about travel somewhere. starting about transportation, accommodation, culinary, tourist attractions and others.
For shopaholics, Singapore is the best place for it. various branded goods at unreasonable prices are here. Many foreign tourists who come here just to spend money on shopping.
However, it does not mean that a vacation to Singapore has to pay a lot of money. Even for you backpackers, Singapore is also friendly to your pockets, as long as you are good at taking advantage of the promos there. Starting from lodging promos and tourist attractions. and you have to make sure from the start that you just take pictures at these tourist spots. 🤭😂
If you don't want to stay there, Daycation is the answer. One day is enough for you to explore your favorite tourist spots there.
If you are from Indonesia, you can depart from Batam via the earliest ship which departs at 6 am, approximately 1 hour of travel time you have arrived at Singapore and the last return to return to Batam is 9 pm.
If you are from Malaysia, you can use air transportation via plane at KLIA1 or KLIA2 and ground transportation via buses that go to Singapore at KLCC or other Bus station.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore government is still restricting tourists from abroad. we all hope that COVID-19 will end soon and tourism will quickly recover.
Always make sure to Wash your hands, Wear your mask, Watch your distance.
Enjoy your holiday."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very good place for family weekend outing. Lots of things to play and good promotions due to Covid-19. Some activities are closed but the rest are open again. Worth visiting again for family with kids.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A place for get away from the usual busy life. Suitable for the young and old.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"We cycled there at night, so quiet and cooling ☺"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Crowded, express pass recommended. Good walking shoes are advised, overall fun experience"
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Perhaps it was the recent cold weather that makes one gloomy, or perhaps she's just had her dinner and is coming down from the sugar crash, but the person manning the help hotline was quick to establish that she wants to get off the call as soon as possible and that she was ineffectual in helping any of my concerns. Armed with the long lost art of taichi-ing the questions to all the other departments, you hate to hear the favourite quotes ""Er this one, I'm afraid I can't help you, you have to email here/call this""

Would have expected much better help and response from a point of contact with customers but I guess that's too much to ask for"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Expensive, tourist place, but worth the family time.."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Lots of people coming here still. But safety measures being diligently applied. Everybody is politely reminded of mask requirements.
There are queues waiting to enter the beach and other attractions due to maximum entry limit being enforced.

Resorts World Sentosa,1,"The whole booking process is online and yet the online system is poorly done, not user friendly and lack of help. It is exasperating to get the ticketing and system sort out. Very unfriendly services. Manager at the sea aquarium ticketing could not offer any help. Poor service!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Awesome place with awesome facilities including a casino and amusement park. Many attractions and food available here. Hotels are awesome as well!
There is even a convention hall for large scale events and activities."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's a nice place, currently during the covid 19 period it is definitely less crowded due to the heavy decrease in the amount of visitors. I do recommend however for when tourists are back to come during September/October or during March/April."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Relax and nice place. 👍

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Sentosa Island is one of the best tourist attractions in Singapore. You can easily spend two to three days here without getting bored. And believe me you will not going to regret spending too much time here. It's a beautiful place.

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great play for fun and food and staycation.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Located at the heart of Singapore's Central Business District area, visitors and delegates can enjoy world-class entertainment, shopping, dining, arts and culture, and accommodation options under one roof. Singapore’s many other attractions are all within easy reach.

Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice place to go for holiday with family

Resorts World Sentosa,5,One of the best holidays  ever. Quality things to do all over the  island. Free bus made it  easy to  get  around. Not cheap but   great product. Went in November which was great not to busy. Be careful  not to go when is busy would be  crazy.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Is a wonderful place with kids go for a day trip .
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to entertainment with family and Friends 👫💃👯💏💑
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Went when it first opened in Phase 2 (businesses reopening). Bought the early entry and fast pass.

Good: social distancing was practiced very very well. Only a small percentage of the usual crowd compared to usual, lines for rides were just 10-15 minutes.

Bad: all the shows and several restaurants and cafes were closed. I understand, but would’ve appreciated if we were notified upfront just for expectation. Only rides, 2 stores, 3 cafes were open. Everything else was closed. And the ticket was still full priced"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Good place, walk around n go candy empire buy sweet treat"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Good variety of F&B outlets. Nice ambience

Resorts World Sentosa,5,A nice place.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Tourist price for food, recommend booking activities online before going"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,What a place! The kids would enjoy it the most. We unfortunately had to leave them behind...but had a great time anyway. You know what they say...the child in us never dies. In  a visit to Singapore it can take up at least two days...to do it justice. Combine with it The Gardens by the Bay...which isn't too far. I think the Sea creatures observatory and the Universal studios were the best. We initially thought the rates of the Universal were a tad high. But the experience there changed our mind...turned out to be worth every penny. The only downside is that the waiting in the queues for the shows can be a tad tiring. There is a provision for a priority lane for every show...though I have no clue how one gets those passes. I suggest you keep one whole day for Universal.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,For quarantine so can't comment much but my stay had been comfortable.
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"went to universal studio,and they still sell ticket but almost all attraction are closed or having technical difficulty. so u open for what?? uss terminated all technician so no one maintain anymore? all breakdown??? very bad! worse!

gift shop also close!!!

u open and sell ticket for what????

so crowded,and never got safe distancing. see pictures,all closed"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"When there isn't a crowd, it's honestly calming to be there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,You won't get lost in sentosa. The place have alot of fun things to do with your friends
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Awesome place for family getaway which offers anything and everything for every age range... Too many attractions and you would not be able to cover them all within one day...

An ideal holiday would be of 3D4N to make it really worthwhile. Do check local weather as with any tropical country, the rain will come unannounced..."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The place is baby friendly, good for the toddler to learn about sea animals."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Due to safe distancing measures, all the rides require longer waiting time"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Gokart and USS was fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Attraction were well maintain during our visits
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Honestly I am quite disappointed with the services of the hotel reservation for our 1st staycation there. With the price we paid, we were not treated as VIPs."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Alot of difference compare 5 years back.
Covid-19 really took its toll on RWS.
Hope all ends well and receive more tourists and locals in Future."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Need better maintenance. Too bad some food and entertainment outlets are still closed during the pandemic period.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great fun for the family. Good time to go now as it's really empty.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,My son had such a wonderful time in Nestopia outdoor playground ☺
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Tourists-friendly beautiful island and making people fully enjoy the atmosphere and convenience in this resort.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's a very beautiful and diverse place. It has  wide range of services to offer, from kiddies games to adults fun worlds as well.
The restaurants there are just lovely. It took me back home and reminded me of our very own ""SUN CITY"" just that this one its in a league of its own.

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Housing a casino amongst other things. Has a huge underground car park
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Amazing place to be. A great place to spend time with your family and friends. Plan your trip meticulously. Reach there in morning from cable car. After that you can go and visit different places inside like trick eye museum, aquarium and other things.
Don't plan universal studios trip with Sentosa resort. Universal studios trip needs one day dedicated."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The place outdoor is huge, even my legs are tired. However it is a good place."
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"Very quiet, nothing same as the feeling before lock down. Shocked. 25% open only, Harry's restaurant became my go to restaurant for the trip."

Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Before it was known as Sentosa, this island just off Singapore’s southern coast was a British military fortress. After the Japanese Occupation in World War II, Singapore returned to British rule, and the island was renamed “Sentosa” which translates to “peace and tranquility.”

Over the course of its remarkable history, Sentosa has transformed into a beloved island resort, best known for its tropical beaches, luxurious hotels and thrilling attractions. Whether you’re looking for an adrenaline rush or a day of bold exploration, a world of adventure awaits you at Sentosa."

but most of the ride only open at 2 pm"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Very cool resort area.
A number of fancy sweets shops and I saw two eating areas - one 'Korean Market Street' and a Hawker style Malay food area.
All very reasonably priced overall for it being a resort area.

Everything is clearly marked which is good - so you can navigate around to what attractions you want to go.

We went to Adventure Cove on a day forecast for rain.
Great idea since while it rained we did all the rides etc"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,So much fun! Halloween Horror nights is the best! But the queues are until 3 hours long? What the hell. Next year we're buying express tickets. Please give us more discounts for cheaper Halloween tickets.

Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's a very fun place to be at...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very beautiful and interesting.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A complete one day entertainment with complete family. This place is awesome with lots of fun rides and thrilling atmosphere.

An express pass can save your day as you can enjoy all rides by skipping the queue. A must go place if you are visiting Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Beautiful place to be at...
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Nice place, but be prepared to pay through the nose for any food or water"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Although now is down period all staff and people still so warm
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is a mini world on its own. Full of activities to spend the weekend.  Ended the day with an evening cable car ride. It is just way too beautiful.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Amazing experience, it starts with cable car journey and ends with wings of the fire show. Both start and end are great. There are many things to explore specially good for family. Not suitable for honeymoon because it needs lot of walking which exhaust you."
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"Not the right time to visit. Due to social distancing measures each ride waiting time is always over 2hrs
6month pass cancelled

So you spend over $70 for 2 rides? You can decide guys.."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Look like a dead city.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One if the best places to stay, everything was perfect"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Usual tourist attraction
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Long queue (at long as 1 hour to 2 hours) for most attractions and even food drink stores.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Wonderful place for tourists to see the heritage of Singapore.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A place of joy and relaxing moments
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Worth every penny if you not been to Universal Studio. Amazing fun. Go early like really early. Avoid weekends and holidays cause rides will get crowded. Happy, thrill and loads to shop even for adults and teens. Must for young kids."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great resort island with lots of museums, amusement areas and shopping. Excellent restaurants. Clean and spacious. Easy access to beach with water sports activities. Quick access with tram, bus and private transportation. Has nice hotels to stay. Very safe. Great customer services. Beautiful landscape with jogging and biking trails. Lots of shading areas and rest stops."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fun fun fun! That's all I have to say! All rides are fun!
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"nice places ,neat ,clean ,good service n got shuttle bus"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Place is packed with fun and exhilarating adventures! Horror nights, Roller Coasters and more! The view is much more amazing at night! More beautiful lights! Such a breathtaking experience! Definitely worth to visit for the Holidays."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Universal studio’s entertainment park in Singapore. Nice but there’s long queues everywhere. You can purchase the express ticket to skip the queues.

Queues are notably shorter during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to restrictions on the total number of visitors allowed in the park."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good place beautiful area clean and not so crowded during covid 19
Resorts World Sentosa,5,/ilke resort world sentosa like play
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is where the fun begins.
It's very well connected to the city.

Guides help out in any way they can.

RWS is the place to start your trip from.

Start with Beaches, Universal studios, S.E.A. aquarium and so much more."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fun places for friends and family
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"*Note: This is a unique dining experience launched by RWS, where diners are invited to have their dinner in the SEA Aquarium. This will be a lengthy review.

Event: Aqua Gastronomy (Festive Edition)

Date: 8 November 2020

Timeslot: 6pm to 8pm

Food: This was a 4-course meal put together by a few restaurants located in RWS. I have included the menu for reference. Personally, I felt that the dishes were not outstanding. This is not to say that the food was bad; in fact the dishes were above average. However, I took into account the price point when making this review.

For the Snowy Morning, the dry ice presentation and shaoxing snow topping were nice touches to kickstart the first course.

For the Reflection of Bliss, my prawns were fresh but a little too mushy/soft for my liking. I generally prefer a more ""springy"" texture. The soy noodles were tasty albeit slightly overcooked.

For the Northern Lights, the miso cod was tender and cooked to perfection. The rice was not particularly inspiring and I felt that the intended flavours were not captured sufficiently.

On top of the 4-course meal, I added on the lobster and wagyu beef alongside my main. The lobster was fresh, and the gruyere cheese complemented it very well. The wagyu tenderloin (approximately 150g) did not disappoint, and the kitchen managed to get the doneness right for mine.

For the Gift of Treasures and Petit Four, the novelty factors definitely shone through.

Ambience: The opportunity to have my dinner in the aquarium while watching manta rays cruising by was quite a joy. Ultimately, the santa divers + Christmas bg music + Christmas themed decorations sealed the deal and most definitely elevated the entire experience for me. The evening was rounded off with a nice door gift of bottled sea salt and a postcard:) On a final note, I would like to commend a particular service staff, Ashley, for her impeccable service and friendliness throughout the entire meal!

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the festivity and concept of this dining experience. However, since personal experiences are highly subjective, it will be difficult for me to advise on whether this dinner was ""worth-it"" price-wise. I will share some pictures that were taken during dinner and let you decide! Pardon the poor pictures, I have yet to master the art of food photography."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Beutifull scenery and amazing rides
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place. But pricey though.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Not many attractions are open due to covid 19, thus a bit crowd during school holiday"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good food and ambience..
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Spacious and very nice place to just stroll and relax.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Nice ambience nice chicken rice.Ps do not order Mee Goreng if you do not like sweet
."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Terrible management of Universal studios during the covid period. Worse than even malaysia's theme parks.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"A huge entertainment complex which offers something for everyone. Lots of restaurants. There is a casino, universal studios,aquarium and hotels. It's also easily accessible by public transport. We enjoyed our time here"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The one and only theme park in Singapore- universal studios. You must go early, as always there is a huge crowd, in order to enjoy the rides. The universal Express card is really worth it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Different places of theme park/water park/ etc for all ages
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Currently with covid situation, it's quiet, some of the restaurants have shorter opening hours, but it's a nice place to roam around, great for staycation"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Well organised. Tons of attractions
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Is fun at uss sentosa
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place but at this time you may only able to check in at around 4pm. I went there for  2 days 1 night stay at Michael hotel.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"This place is too expensive even for local people. I do came across people from overseas such as Taiwan 🇹🇼, Thailand 🇹🇭  Cambodia 🇰🇭, Vietnam etc. Said Singapore 🇸🇬,  is getting too expensive for them to visit especially at tourist site. I do agree with them and even local people bringing their foreign guests also complained."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"We have been at Universal, it is a great place to be with a 6 years old child"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Its fun for me n my family as its my first time there n enjoy a few rides but not the challenger one like the roller coaster as l m hav high blood pressure . My daughter n her hubby did try the human one (RC) ,,, any way we hav to take care of their two kids one is 3 yr n another one is 8mths old ..."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A place where u pretend to be in a far, far away land and live happily ever after...Take the rides to enjoy the place.."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Lots to do. Adventure Cove is great. Aquarium also great. Good a bit expensive. Can spend the whole day there and not get bored.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Best holiday destination. It has everything one needs from a vacation. Sea World. Water park. Adventure part. Perfect weather and beautiful landmarks. Do visit. Can be a bit expensive though so be prepared to burn some holes in your pocket.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Places are nice for family outing
Resorts World Sentosa,5,WOW NICE
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing place😊👍
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great 👍  place to visit.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"1 of my favourite 🇪🇸SPAINISH food name ""FOC"" English means 🔥FIRE! Haha2! The food wine is very gd!"
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"Great for those with kids, not that appealing for adults. The transformers ride was shut and no-one told before buying our tickets and entering the park. Closed for scheduled maintenance - this is the best ride in the park, we probably wouldn’t have bothered had we known it was shut. The Sesame Street Show is FANTASTIC! A must do for kids that love music, and even those with no kids!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Amazing as as a whole! Kind of higher prices compared to the rest of the City, especially if you are looking for something to eat. Otherwise there are so many things you can explore. I would defined recommend at least a visit."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Not crowded and fun to go around with family and friends
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Beautiful place to hang out my eyes full every time visit sentosa. SINGAPORE IS AMAZING ❤️
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Nice place. Convention centre good food good. Universal Studios was fun. Not been to the hotels. Plenty of eating places. Staff generally very polite and attentive. If there is one negative, it's hot, the weather, I mean"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,So clean and pretty.
Resorts World Sentosa,2,Loads of food variety but nothing uniquely RWS.
Resorts World Sentosa,2,Hot! How can anybody enjoy themselves when you are perspiring profusely? Air flow needs to be seriously looked into!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Every one need to experience
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place was absolutely amazing! Everyone is so friendly and everything is here! Universal Studios was of course the best attraction and money was well spent on keeping the tourists and locals impressed!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Spent a day here..it's amazing ..so many things to do and see ..arrived by cable car the view was fantastic. You could see the whole of the Island..there is a beautiful beach.. hotels ..lots of things for the children to do..shops.. restaurants.. cafes..sweet shops.. Universal Studios.. beautiful aquarium..left my mono rail ..great day.. if you get a chance you should visit ..
Resorts World Sentosa,5,My oh my! What do I write abut this place? Simply the best time I had in Singapore and what a busy place and beautiful place to be. Amazing to see all at one place and live up the the rumor of Singapore high life. You get to see everything you want in one place. Must visit if you are there in Singapore. Takes about a day but definitely worth it.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"fun and enjoyable day for the family, but need to set the expectations since some shows and eateries are closed"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,nice place to visit
Resorts World Sentosa,4,I like the place but with restrictions everywhere I suggest that book a slot in advance
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice interesting rides. The queues were not long at all. We got to try out all the exciting rides we wanted. Nicest chickenhotdogs we have ever had. Weather was perfect
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I hv  l9ng long bicyvle ride into Sentosa.. What a wonderful view...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Perfect location.. we book family room.. it fit family of 5.. they have sofa bed and bunk bed ... and the main bed is so much comfortable... we slept well there.. and the staff very helpful  and nice..
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great place with lots of activities and food places all around. The Waterworld show was magnificent, must see it! And Transformers was amazing..
The reason I gave 4 stars not 5 is the extreme cost of express pass (S$160pp!!!) and lots  of groups were behaving really disturbing cutting lines everywhere!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It got everything, good food, great attractions and something for all ages. Great hotels to stays too. The monorail gives seamless transport for free"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Many types of fish we can see floura n fauna wonderful underwater world
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Amazing day spent at Sentosa.. The cable car ride was amazing, perfectly easy to take a toddler along as the place is kid friendly. Be ready with a very comfortable pair of shoes and to walk a lot though. Also, a light weight stroller for kids is highly advisable to carry"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Due to covid19 there were too much of restrictions so not enjoying the trip this time
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Nice place!
Wear a comfortable shoes, you   need to walk from place to another. For persons with disability make sure to bring wheelchair. For your child bring stroller"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great resort island with lots of museums, amusement areas and shopping.  Excellent restaurants.  Clean and spacious.  Easy access to beach with water sports activities.  Quick access with tram, bus and private transportation.  Has nice hotels to stay.  Very safe.  Great customer services.  Beautiful landscape with jogging and biking trails.  Lots of shading areas and rest stops."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The place is fun because of so many attractions they put in here. But they seems not maintain the area too well. It’s getting old over the time. I arrived when it’s raining, no many people there and i walked almost without people around and i can see the buildings are looking old. But you will never notice that when it’s crowded. Other than that, Sentosa is the best place for fun you can get in Singapore"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Enjoyable! It has been a long time since we came here.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing day out! Well worth a visit if you're in Singapore. Great selection of thrill rides and family friendly rides. Also good selection of eateries through the park.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,High standard botique
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It is huge! Make sure you are prepared to walk a lot. Comfy shoes and a hat are a must. Everything on this Island is such fun. Highly recommended! It is a must to visit. Great places to eat as well.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,BEST RESORT.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great fun for the whole family. Especially nowadays when there’s limited tourists. Little time spend queuing:)
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is sentosa, not too far and you can go there by cable car."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,One of the most famous tourist places in Singapore. Variety of attractions and universal studio in the island. water theme  park is a great experience. and SEA aquarium as well. tourist should visit the place. there is Casino for those Gamblers.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"An ideal vacation for many people is a trip to an exotic location where they stay at a luxurious resort. All throughout the year, people from developed countries flock to those that are less developed to take advantage of the beautiful surroundings, warm weather and all inclusive resorts. I have been on a few vacations like these and I have always found the experience to be highly unrealistic and superficial as the resorts are completely separate from the local community and culture. I have been to resorts in Mexico and Cuba, however I never got to experience true Mexican or Cuban culture, for the most part my family never strayed far from the resort. My experiences and taking DEVS have caused me to wonder what effect these resorts have on the local people and how does it affect my view of them. Not only that but how does this relate to the bigger issues we have studied so far in DEVS; the relationship between the developing and Third World countries and Edward Said’s notion of Orientalism. This paper will argue that vacation resorts in Third World countries have a negative effect of the culture of the locals and that they contribute to the Western view that Third World countries are inferior.

Resorts are kept separate from the local communities. There is usually some sort of boundary marking the edges of the resort that creates a

2sense of keeping the tourists in, but also keeping the locals out. There is also limited transportation for tourists to travel around the area surrounding their resort. Not only is there a physical barrier but a psychological one. Tourists are encouraged to stay within the confinements of the resort, this isolation brought on by the resort is to keep the money spending within the hotel so it gains maximum profit (United 1976:83). The resorts provide everything a tourist might want from many types of food and drinks, and a wide range of activities. However, there are many adverse affects to this. The resorts are made to seem safe and the surrounding areas to seem unfamiliar and dangerous. Tourists are told of high crime rates and encouraged to take hotel transportation instead of local taxis as well as to always keep a close eye on their belongings in fear of them being stolen. This causes resort vacationers to seldom leave the resort and they never actually see or experience the local culture. Tourists arrive with a feeling of uncertainty of experiencing a new way of life, which is further emphasized through the segregation of the resort. If a tourist does want to leave the resort, usually they go on some sort of guided tour provided to them, which causes the encounters to be contrived and superficial (McRae 2003: 241). This clear and deliberate separation, between the luxurious and pristine resorts and the surrounding areas, which are usually impoverished, creates a distinction between the tourists and the locals, which translates to the developed countries and the Third World (Ibid: 239). It causes a sense of superiority on the part of the tourists and creates views that the local people are dangerous and inferior (United 1976:79)."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,So good 😄
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Awesome place to see with friends and family... Once in your lifetime just go and see it... And yeah definitely one day is not enough to see the full place... just enjoy within the time... that's it have fun....
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Where you can escape from your routine and find something new on fun and experience. Very good for kids and adults as well. You need to prepare 1 full day to enjoy all.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Gorgeous, beautiful, but every activity costs money and if you're not spending money you won't have much fun. Trying every activity costs more than a ticket to Universal Studios, so might as well do that instead and just have a walk around the island. The gift shop at Sentosa cable car station is cool though."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Unable take a single ride due to long ques
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A wonderful place with many hotels, restaurants and attractions. You have to visit it many times to explore everything. Universal Studios is one of the most fantastic part, it has many rides and shows and performances and all are clean and the staff very friendly. There is also a casino and hotels with thousands rooms. A nice attraction is Merlin and the laser show that takes place every night on the facade. Highly recommended place of Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Very recommended for morning walk or afternoon walk. Can be free entrance for some attractions. Take a bus 123 for visit and go home with monorail for free transport! The Universal Studio has awesome!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Was there for shn.. Room is fine.. Food provided varied.. Staff friendly and polite
Resorts World Sentosa,5,nice place lot of activities for family
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Plenty place of attractions like universal stidio..trick eye museum, adventure cove..SEA aquarium n much more.."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"1 of the place that you have to visit, when you are in Singapore. It has many popular & fun attraction. Some of the attraction that I personally have visited are Universal Studio, Adventure Cove, & S.E.A Aquarium. All of them offer different experience. And all of them are great place for families! So what are you waiting for.. Let's GO!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"A family resort with a Universal Studios theme park, a water park, an aquarium with a couple of fascinating manta rays and hammer head sharks. Many different hotels to suit different tastes and every place is within walking distance of each other."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"It's compact but what you want to have is all there, enough to keep the whole family entertained, especially for first time visitors and tourists. Avoid weekends and holidays if you can to beat the crowd m fighting for a table to eat in any one of the restaurants can be a difficult task. I gave the average rating because the signage weren't very clear,  one can get easily lost,  and staffs aren't always available to guide you."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Owned and operated by Asia's largest gaming operator, Resorts World Sentosa is unrivalled in its intimate knowledge of Asian gaming preferences. The place brims with activity 24/7 and is complemented by unparalleled customer privileges. Our trained croupiers and hand-picked Guests Services Ambassadors will ensure our customers get an enjoyable and memorable experience.(Internet)"
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Hotel is clean and luxurious but the Ocean Suites is dated and completely overpriced ($1500USD a night). Yes, it has a view of the aquarium and it is in fact pretty novel and brilliant as a concept. But the rooms are across a parking structure far away from the lobby and entrance to that area in the building leaves much to be desired. We wanted to check the room out before committing to that exorbitant price and walked out without a doubt that it was not worth the price. Get a nicer room and just visit the aquarium!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Good places for entertainment for everyone..... Nice food n shopping
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Great place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Perfect for family outing .. much more enjoyment ..
Due to this pandemic kindly book your tickets online."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,SOME THINGS OK BUT I NEVER SEE SENTOSA AS SAME AS DISNEY LAND THAT HAVE ALL GAMES
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Loved this place. We did not have enough time to spend there in the evening on both the days we visited but the place is very nice.  Transportation is super easy.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Pretty quiet under the pandemic
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Exceptional.. My kiddos had so much fun on the rides. Whole day to take all the rides is not enough if you will buy a normal ticket. You have to get an express tickets i think. I Will definitely come back with my kiddos...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Lots of entertainment can be quite pricey.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It is a great place to visit for tourists, not so much if you’re local unless you really enjoy the Casino. As a local I feel like there’s nothing much that this place has to offer me but for a tourist there are many theme parks around and attractions for you to visit. This place is definitely must to visit if you’re planning for a trip to Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome sights. Great place to spend 2 hours
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Very magical resort. Feels like I’m out of Singapore when I visit Resort Worlds Sentosa. With an amazing theme park, an aquarium, a water theme park, and a lot of shopping and dining experiences, Resorts World Sentosa is a must visit when in Singapore. You will never regret it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Lots of attractions but overpriced food and retail, and overcrowded."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Staff is not helpful at all. I used to be a regular visitor here but with today's bad experience regarding the membership... I will definitely  stop going here.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of the best days of my trip in Singapore was the day I visited universal studios.
All rides are awesome and breathtaking.
I would suggest you plan 2 days for resorts world sentosa. One day for universal studios and other for exploring the remaining island."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Good value for money. Go for the whole day for value. There are  many options to go there, make sure you weight them. Dress accordingly. Went with children, had a time when I lost them. It  was very stressful, but my son came back before I reported the incident. Eating was not pleasant, the accommodation needs to be larger. For accompanying adults there were times when we wished for more seats. However, overall, we were impressed. I'm sure it would be hard to come up for other competitions with better value for money. Many add-ons available for different activities, appreciate the low entry price."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is where Universal Studios Singapore is located, the theme park operates during the day as well as selected evenings. During the evening, some theme park facilities that requires manual operation is stopped, such as the photo shoots for the indoor roller coaster for the mummy. But the main outdoor roller coaster still runs and is highly popular."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,The covic has take a heavy toll on RWS as u can see it's quite deserted for a tourist attractions.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Spend about one and a half hour and we completed the whole aquarium. It wasn't as crowded during phase 2 on a weekday but reasonable crowd.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great place. Need to stay at least 2 days at the island to fully experience the place.. Night safari is nice. Can skip the 4D show (it was dissapointing...we have better ones here). The light and sound show is good.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Walk on the beach, get some retail therapy, do it all on the quaint little island of Sentosa"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,What is there not to like at this place!!!  Way better than the one in L.A.  Lots to do and fun and amazing atmosphere.  Easily spend a whole day here and love every moment of it!!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,never disappoints.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great for family outing explore historical places beach n many more.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The best hostel along with there rocking services. Absolute resort for vacation specially rockstar and music lover. Resort amenities are good. But please arrange early check in facilities specially night travelers. 🤟🤟
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Due to Covid, the time waited to take lift spend longer"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Been somentime since my last visit. The only thing missing is the lack of crowd. Safe Distance.
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"With out of control circumstances Resorts World is definitely apathetic to customers and you're just a giant bob for them. Don't appreciate how they're handling my query. When emailing them from London, I am fully aware of time zones but it does take a while for them to get back to you... Definitely being put off their resort..."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A Dream place to visit with your loved ones. But 1 day is too less to explore it. You have a lot of things there which you would never wish to miss like the sunset time at the beach, the magical shores, wings of time, madame tussaud's and a full day for the ultimate UNIVERSAL STUDIOS."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to holiday
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Place full of wonder
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Can be crowded especially when holiday period
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Cable car ride was great.  You can get nice arial view.  Good for kids, nice 5D shows, Madame Tussaud is also there"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Superb location with fantastic attractions. Universal studios park is a must to visit but keep it in your mind that if you have motion sickness you will not enjoy the rides in there. It will take one day to finish the universal  studio rides so you will have to come in another day for the other attractions. Also keep it in your mind to visit the madame tussauds wax museum as it will give you a glimpse of the Singapore history. It changes the characters in the museum time to time so you can have a different experience in each visit.S.e.a Aquarium is a wonderful attraction for the people who love fish and other sea creatures. the Jellyfish collection they have is so beautiful.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,My kids had fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's a wonderful experience...I wish I could visit..each and every attraction...with a little more care... However because of a crunch of time...I was able to visit the sea aquarium and universal theme park only...and both of them was magnificent...suffice to say you could stay here for 3-4 days and will still not be satisfied with your tour... Regardless to say...but it was one of the best experiences I have ever had.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Place was huge. A lot of games. A lot of different roller coasters. Yet a lot of people. You'll need to wait in line for more than an hour for each game. Sometimes if their machine got problem, games will be delayed. Tried to buy food from the stalls but the seller said its not halal. A bit frustrated on that. Otherwise, you have a lot of spot to take picture with."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,I didn't even go there I just wanna earn novice reviewer
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Excellent place to stay or enjoy in Singapore. Definitely a must. Most happening place for tourists.
However need atleast 2 days if you want to explore the whole island as there is so much stuff to do like visiting Universal Studios which itself will take a full day. Luge, sky diving, light and fire show, Sea Aquarium,  rides etc. But a lot pricey. So need lot of money to explore everything.
Try cable ride to enter Sentosa as it gives a great view of singapore city on one side and sea on other.
1 thing I missed is an Indian restaurant in Sentosa Island to have our own loved food. 😛"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Love this place. There's literally something for everyone. Exciting rides, check. Authentic local food, check. Upmarket dining, check. Killer shopping... You know the answer. Just come already!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It is amazing place and you can enjoy whole day here, so many activities here...Fun and Adventure activity Also have beautiful scenery.. you can find food place here easily.. people are enjoying here"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,OK I guess but F&B is very expensive
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"came here for a staycation after phase 2, it’s a mess. they’re still recovering from the pandemic and trying to sort everything out, so here’s a price of advice: while they incentivise everyone to come here, don’t expect that you will get the same quality of experience as you’re used to. most things are inaccessible, attractions, food, shuttle services, only open on selected days, selected hours, and 1/2 of them are no longer accessible. they don’t tell you that several services are terminated, and honestly, the staff are confused as heck too. yes, it’s understandable because they’re trying to sort out the pandemic’s impact, but honestly it’s still quite frustrating as a consumer when they set up the expectations for the experience and don’t deliver, or pre-empt that things will be closed. we only find out that we can’t visit so many attractions and services and amenities after."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A place with many outdoor activities and many different kinds of facilities like swimming, roaming around parks, enjoying different kinds of rides at Universal Studios, the SEA aquarium and beach. There is cruise ships available for romantic dinner dates on the sea at around evening and night. There’s also seating arrangements besides the river to enjoy quality time with friends, family, partners and kids."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is another must do for any group of friends or family. There are a multitude of activities to do here right from universal studios, aquarium, water park and a bunch of other fun activities. It is worth spending a day here and doing whichever activity you'd enjoy. They also have surfing(wave pool) and indoor skydiving. Highly recommend anyone visiting Singapore to spend one day here at the very least."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Extremely horrible customer service. I booked the tickets for 11 August but was informed that there were no slots available. When I emailed them back and tried calling them on the 11th morning to see if anything could be done as it was to celebrate my wife's birthday as she loves marine life, I was not able to reach them. Hence, I just made other plans to celebrate with my wife.

At 1.27pm they emailed back saying that my reservations are confirmed but I only saw the email at 3.50pm. Therefore, I asked them if it could be refunded as it was quite last minute notice and they were closing at 5pm.

Throughout the email chain, the customer service just kept saying that no refunds will be given.

Will never go back nor will I ever recommend anyone to visit such a place with such horrible customer service."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,xtremely fun i had a lot of fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Nice place but not much fish if fishing,  after midnight then come here if want to fishing."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Only half the shops were open, and too crowded due to school holidays"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Too crowded this time. Maybe due to the explore singapore voucher.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Great family escape from the big malls
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The best place in Singapore to be in
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Easy access to beach and water sports activities.
Quick access with train and bus.
Great resort and island, beautiful landscape.
One day is not sufficient.
Me and my wife enjoyed the evening at beach."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's nice, i like it"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Quiet now because of covid
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Really a great place for family fun & Joy. Be sure you are up to it as a full Exploration & Experienced took me from 9.45am - 8.30pm! That's more than 8 hrs! Great Place! 😉
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Not bad great arcitectuere
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place has extraordinary places for you to take pictures
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Its a mind blowing for all kids so do adults
Resorts World Sentosa,5,True Rejoice world
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Wonderful place. Lot of activities to do. Children can have a lot of fun here. Not only children its good and have something for everyone
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Absolutely amazing place to enjoy Best part of it  it's Universal Studio Singapore I had a great time with my friends over there. Obviously they got one time entry fees with variation. At USS they have many attractions , rides and many more stuffs to get into it.
RWS also have sea aquarium, Adventure Cove Park, and Dolphin Island. This attractions are awesome too.
As well as there are many F&B outlets and restaurans so, can enjoy the various foods. 😋"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Great place to have a fun day out with the family. There is only two big rides but they are great. The rest of the rides are mainly virtual reality but they are good. You can do the whole park in one day if you get the fast track ticket. Well worth a visit when in Singapore.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,It was okay but i lost mu specs and i barely get any help :/ by the staff so idk
Resorts World Sentosa,5,But still very quiet as no tourists.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great place for fun guaranteed
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Relax and lots of exciting activities.. Good
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Nice and clean,"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Excellent island 🌴 in Singapore 🇸🇬 you can enjoy 😊 food and beverages and Casino for all of you. Different restaurant like Cantonese food western food local food and very sunny day . I’m not a fan on the pool 🏊‍♀️ but I like all the restaurants here . Regarding hotel 🏨 please don’t put eye on details about service or other facilities in hotel. But , if you really want a top service I may suggest you go to city look for better 5 stars . Enjoy"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Waited so long for each game show. Atleast 40-50min
Resorts World Sentosa,4,A lot of options for fun things to do for both adults and kids. Plenty of free things to experience as well. The long walk to the fort is worth it. The scenes are breathtaking. Follow the paths and you won't get lost.
Resorts World Sentosa,2,Average really. Place needs a repaint and clearly has no idea how to handle crowds. Queueing is all over the place with 150 min queues in some places.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Had attended wedding at Resorts World Sentosa, ambience was excellent however the service was average - waiters were inexperienced. Setting up of the banquet tables should be done quicker to prevent a snowball of events. For the price per table, more could have been done."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"If you happened to be in Singapore for a vacation, make sure to make a stop at this place. It's one of the best theme park in this region of the world. A Universal Studio theme park of an international standard. You won't regret it."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A place as awesome as it can get. If you are visiting Singapore with or without family you should keep one whole day (or even two) for this place. Every one in your group will get things of their interest from kids to old. Also if you are going through an agent get good amount of tokens for the place in advance. It will be cost effective. If you buy tokens after reaching their it will be quiet costly in comparison.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Much smaller than the US sister parks, but definitely worth the visit! Even in a Sunday, the lines were not too bad and there was enough time to get to our favorites a couple of times."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Always love Resorts World Sentosa. Lots to do there, never short of excitement and fun. Easily accessible via walking,  cable cars,  and trains or buses."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great location for holiday, Singapore is such a great city, everyone is nice, everything is nice and organized, do many places to visit and sites to see. One of my favorite places in the planet. Sentosa is so beautiful, with so many activities, for families and kids and even just couples. Highly recommend visiting Sentosa"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Disappointed lots of show closed due to covid19 safety issues in universal studios, Mega adventure park also closed because of the bad weather..."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Not crowded at this moment, u can enjoy better"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great entertainment place, got everything for the whole family.
You can spend whole day and whole week there.
We've been to S.E.A Aquarium.
My son love seeing the various kinds of fish and sea animals.
Better book ticket online. We've been there to buy have to queue up for long time and the weather is very warm."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Big place to have fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice nice very nice
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Exciting and entertaining for the whole family. The Christmas theme is beautifully present and the show is the highlight. We came early bit still could not finish everything. Prepare to be exhausted. Jonathan Bill Kueh from Perth. Dynasty Embroidery
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Excellent. Spent an entire day here and there was no boring moment. It was fantastic. Universal studios was super dope!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice place for group outings and couples too. Visit historical places of interest and the beaches for a swim. Good hotels and restaurants. Expect to spend abit of money to enjoy the island.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Very good for a day outing. The places to visit are nice.
We did enjoy the SEA Aquarium a lot.
The luge ride is something not to be missed."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Good selection of attractions and stores
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Over all a good place to spend the day, specially for kids. Universal Park is entertaining. However the signage of the cable car and route to reach are not very clear."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice park. Many rides available. Not quite the Orlando experience but close enough. Recommending for visit.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,One of the most beautiful places ever been. There's so much of peace and calmness. Loved the place
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Amazing place. Must take rope way to see the top view. Although the queue is very long for it. But worth the wait.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very beautiful hotel. Enjoyed the property
Resorts World Sentosa,5,World class place to different types of events
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I'm satisfied
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice. Awesome
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great place to relax, with many things to go do and see. Access is free if you take the short, covered walkway to the island. Some of the activities can be quite expensive, such as the theme park, aquarium etc, so if you want to visit keep it in mind."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,A place full of entertainment. Should spend more than a day to enjoy this place. Need to walk around a lot and prepare for the tropical sun heat. But you can easily find vendors sell ice cream or beverages to freshen up before continuing the walk
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Its a nice place to go and relax
Resorts World Sentosa,4,It's empty due to covid. Parking is capped at 9 bucks for full day which is good.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Outstanding resort. Spent five wonderful hours there, completely warn out. And still didn't see all of it. Wednesday seems to be a quiet day?"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"t 1
y.t."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"Never believing in RWS promotions ever again. Horrible customer service, wait, no customer service at all after emailing them and waiting more than 48hours, no number to contact, no updates on their social media if they would suspend or refund USS passes. This is extremely irresponsible for a billion dollar company that rather than being a state of the art attraction in Singapore, is sadly just a train wreck . Please get back with your customers and give us back our money."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One place endless possibilities.
It has got everything you need. All you need a good pair of walking shoes, water bottle and a desire to explore and unwind. Water fountains every where to keep you hydrated."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Every attraction here in unique and exciting. The place in itself might confuse you a bit. And is also a little more expensive.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fun for the family!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing island we stayed in the island free from the city traffic. Very green directions are generally good. Staff are generally friendly except with the cable car they barked at us not a friendly way to show visitors. The cable car get quite muggy nice if it could be air-conditioned it will make it breath taking. All the attractions are fantastic. Too expensive make it cheaper. Funny thing is senior citizen is only for people live in Singapore makes no sense. You are not senior citizen if you don't live in Singapore. The bus frequency is bad. Why so big buses why not have more frequent battery operated vehicle.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Sentosa is the awesome place for having a fun out day. Loved the rides and has lots of theme based activities for kids under 7 years.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Some shops are gone new ones coming in. Some areas seem like ghost town but it's another adventure!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,♡ s e n t o s a
Resorts World Sentosa,4,The roller coaster rides are good. In case of rush plan these rides towards later part of the day probably towards 1730 he's and enjoy. Did CYLON and it was exhilarating
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Resort World Sentosa where most of the adventure takes place. It has the adventure cove, it has universal studios, sea aquarium etc. Its the Island that houses these great places. It is loaded with interesting entertainment for both adults and children alike. We went as a group and it was great fun. The kids loved it and so did we the adults. There must be a repeat visit. Sure thing"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Multi dimensional resort to all ages. Forget and forgive the stress mounted life to enjoy yourself among life loving souls around you. Even though it is full of artistic work, there can be added essence of nature. The cost is reasonable for once in a lifetime tourists. Best time to visit in 3pm so that the waitinng period is less."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Lots of hotels, attractions and restaurants. Things are definitely more expensive here compare to the city."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place with alot of attractions to visit and enjoy. Definitely worth the time and money. It's also a full day's affair.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Aqua Gastronomy was perfectly splendid!
Resorts World Sentosa,4,So awesome and very nice the place
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Elegant group of 5 star hotels. You should check out the packages they offer before heading out here. The packages covers stay in these hotels as well as the park inclusions.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's all there. A full day is not enough particularly for families. Beaches, fun parks, entertainment, music, food, bicycle hire, aquarium etc. The best way to get the most out of Sentosa is to stay at the island resort. The island is very clean and up to Singapore's high standards. Try and experience the three methods of travel to and from the island - cable car. ferry and mono rail."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good place for family
Resorts World Sentosa,3,All shows and some attractions are still closed
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Big spacious place with very expensive shops and eateries. One of the most expensive food court in Singapore.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,It's not crowded at the moment - enjoy the space!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The most famous attraction in Singapore!! Need at least 2-3 days too visit every attraction/shows including Universal Studios... Entry to the island by cable car ride is truly mesmerising.... The winds of time light snow is the most famous and most fabulous attraction apart from the Universal Studios..... Words are really not enough to describe the place.... It's a missed visit destination to experience when in Singapore..... World class indeed....
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Best place for vacation.. u can enjoy to the fullest... we had great fun and even the staffs are very good...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"First time at Madame Tussauds. The works are truly amazing. The sculptures are so real, and I find myself wanting to go back again another day to appreciate the art. The Images of Singapore at the side, which shows what life was like around the years of World War II, is also worth the visit. I am glad these were preserved."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"e normal room was ok...standard amenities,  I love the shower room at e swimming area as well as the beach swim area. The sand is soft, with warm waters. My children loves it."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Always a pleasure to visit!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa is a really beautiful island.
You can find everything there, from the small restaurant to the bungee jumping, passing through the beaches.
You can spend an entire day without having time to see everything.
Really really good place.
Highly recommended."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Main attraction of Singapore having lot of fun. Varieties of thematic games, Jurassic Park experience is amazing and most highlight is the transformer vehicle travel..it was just amazing experience than ever.... don't.miss the dragon donkey 3d cinemas.. excellent place for kids.."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great and beautiful place to visit. Just try local Singaporean food ,you won't regret. Laksa is a great dish"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A vibrant place for a day to spend. You have every kind of activity all around you including Universal studios, aquarium , some kids activity area, water park, beach and many more. You can spend a whole day in this area. Good food, accommodation , casino, bars and free transportation within the area; What else you need !"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is such a big place and has a lot to offer. You can opt to visit places that are for free or you can also opt to pay for some rides that are really enjoyable. Had a great time with my relatives exploring RWS. :)
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A large area specially developed for tourists to satisfy varied interests. Aquarium, amusement rides, adventures, food, stay, beaches you name it and they have it covered.

Salute to their vision. You can spend few days easily here if you are interested in covering all the attractions there.

If staying there costs dearly, you can stay in city and come here daily. It is well connected with city and MRT network."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Awesome place... however food and drinks are super expensive... also, queues can be long so worth to top up to get the express pass..."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Happiest place the south of the border? Indeed
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Beautiful place to go. easily access by public transportation. So many places to visit here.  A clean and comfortable place for tourists👍🏻
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice one. I love the place. If you want visit this place. Book your tickets in advance. Look for the packages which come under handy.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place... Really had a great experience... First time in my life am seeing such a great chain of cable car... Really appreciatable work by Singaporeans... Only very limited space for Singapore but they have wisely used every nook and corner of it... My honeymoon was simply awesome.. really had a great time there...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Loving this area. So many f&b outlets, and mostly the favourites. There's also a hard rock cafe. The ambience is superb. Theme park entrance, aquarium entrance, casino entrance, they're all here. Need to come back more."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very quiet nowdayz not too crowded  but not all restaurants open fully
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Attractions are ok. Truly wish they become more vegan friendly. There's no vegan food in the entire resort anywhere. Few vegetarian options, but all served in animal flesh serving restaurants. Facilities are good, very clean, great staff everywhere. I hope they become progressive in the future, and stop the use of sentient mammals for entertainment"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's wonderful. Everyone should visit Singapore at least once in a life time. It's simply the best country to visit if one has limited option
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa Resort world is tourist place in Singapore, here one can spend two to three days  during Singapore trip below are the places to visit over here.
1. Sea Aquarium- It is must visit place in Singapore,  you can find marine world over here, sharks , jellyfish, dolphin and many more species are surrounding to you,
2. Adventure show - It is a 4D show,  one can opt out but you can have better in Universal Studios.
3. Butterfly park - many butterflies species are here , you need to buy a separate ticket for that .
4. Insect kingdom - Different types of insects over here, major are live some are not.
5. Wings of the time show - It is very good light and sound show it runs only in evening,  you finish your whole day activity and at last you can attend the show."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Fantastic family resort, beautifully constructed and themed. Can be a bit much and it's definitely bigger than most people think. Food and drinks can be pricey especially around Universal Studious. There's a mall on the opposite side where you get the Sentosa Express from. Get food there if you don't want to spend too much on the island. Worth a visit, there are parts that will cost you nothing to visit, like the beach."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Be prepared for a wild time at Resorts World™ Sentosa, an integrated resort experience that will keep the whole family enthralled.

The highlight for the kids is the Universal Studios Singapore™ theme park. Enter the world of the silver screen in seven movie-themed zones, filled with exhilarating rides and outdoor shows, and where beloved movie characters like Shrek and Elmo come to life. Experience endless excitement at Resorts World™ Sentosa with a variety of attractions and entertainment hot spots."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place expensive.... Need 2-4 days to enjoy its beauty to the core... Please don't take guide with you... They take you to places only where they get commission... Be careful because so many rules and regulations... No littering at all fines are so harsh....
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Something for everyone. Great food. Lots of parks. Aquarium is brilliant. Adventure cove was the kids favorite, couldn't get them out of the place. Handy tip is too book online so you can get a cabana for 10 bucks"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's so amazink 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"All is good except for the toilets. We need water, I dont know how to use tissue paper. So guys please bring your own bottle if you use one."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The location wasn't hard to access. There were shuttle bus service. Hotel was huge and beautiful. It was a relaxing getaway for me. The services from the hotel was excellent. Enjoyed the overall stayed there. The best part is USS, sea aquarium and adventure coves were just nearby."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Luxurious resort in Sentosa Island, island next to mainland of Singapore. All in one entertainment provided here. We can enjoy Universal Studio theme park all day long, or getting along with family in the SEA Aquarium. Many good restaurants and souvenir stores around here, and also the famous Hard Rock Cafe. There is also Casino, where you can play or just seeing the match on the tables. All the entertainment is expensive but worth to try."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Very quiet due to corona virud
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Good place for vacation. USS, Wings of Time, Luge, etc .. all were very enjoyable for family vacation. Very recommended."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Prayer room closes due to covid. Few attractions closed too.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"USS is a place to spend an entire fun filled  day with the family, specially with children. The rides and shows are thrilling and entertaining. Prioritize these before hand to maximize use of the time. Buy tickets online, buy the express pass to reduce waiting time for the rides, reach early at the opening time of the park to beat the crowd and the lines. Buy ponchos before hand as those sold in the park are expensive, however everyone riding the Jurassic Park ride doesn't get wet either."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Great service and hardware within whole Singapore. Slightly dated facilities if compare with other popular travel location in Asia such as Thailand or Bali. Penlty to do in this small size island which is really surprising. Overall recommended to go if you are planning to visit Singapore.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Universal studio where located at Sentosa Island is very wonderful place to enjoy your holiday. All the rides are fun. Enterance gate ticket is worth for the ride & view of the games. I wish i can go back there.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,7yrs ago this boy is only few months old and today here we are for 2nd times😍
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Love this place. Lots of exciting amusement. Kiddos also have lots of fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"4 dollar for ticket. Jenius card doesn't work. Lively property with 6 themed hotels & a spa, plus outdoor pools, an aquarium & eclectic dining. Cool experience!!! Too many good spot to take pictures"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice entertainment place 🤠☺️
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Photos were taken during local radio station Love 97.2fm Chinese New Year Reunion Lunch. It took place at Resort World Ballroom West.

Resort World Sentosa is a place that you must visit with the Casino and Universal Studios.   Not forgetting S.E.A. and Trick Eye Museum."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"So fun! I recommend it. Spend a day, walk around, eat some good food at the found court and go on a ride or two. We did the luge and had a ball!"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Great fun at the Halloween horror night but wow it was badly organised! Just must be better for a brand like Universal Studios and the price it charges. But the horror houses were good and the usual rides were fun.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"USS at night was fun and chilling, great for the family. Went there for a company event at night, I think it's the best idea from USS ever. We ended off with a fireworks which closed off things well! Will come again at night when there's a chance! :)"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Wow what a great day out. Go early to beat the crowds and heat as much as possible. If you don't like lining up for ages I would suggest buying the express pass if you can afford the extra expense. Some waiting times were well over an hour which is hard for very young or older. Fantastic experience.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good place for a good lunch
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"This is my personal opinion. The place feels completely artificial and money making excercise. I am someone who likes natural surroundings so Sentosa felt completely unnatural. It has tons of activities that you can do for the whole day, just be prepared to spend money."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I visited Harvey restaurant- a very good place a d people were friendly a rare thing in Singapore
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Take a week off and can spend entire time in this wonderful place. Various activities n places available to cool off from your hectic & busy life.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Seaquarium feeling happy😊
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A great place to bring your overseas friends. Good eatery and good fun all around. Great attempt to make you comfortable from our hot sum.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A good place for relaxation as well as enjoyment. So much to do that even 24hours are less. A very happening place which gives an ultra urban feel.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Sentosa hosts almost all the main tourist attraction spots. We had visited adventure cove water park continued with 8pm show of crane dance. Both were amazing. For water park would suggest to bring your towels. To attend crane dance show better be there 10-15 minutes before show timing. It’s a free show loaded with fireworks.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,USS really good fun for kids and busy as you like. Get ready for standard queues. Had lobster noodle in hut R9 discovery by Jurassic dinosaurs entrance.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Loved the beaches there.. do take swimming costumes. While returning monorail queue was large, so plan accordingly. It was very nice in the evening after sun was little low"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Lovely place to go on a weekday.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"One of the must go attractions if you like rides! Children typically enjoy the theater shows so do take of the show timings! To save time, you might want to get the express pass, it is worth it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"I went only to the mall area. Lots of different types of shops. But mostly bars and restaurants. It has a casino. There are ATMs too. You can conveniently go to this place because of its proximity to the monorail station, cable car station, and bus stop."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Has to change some of our travel plans so we were in Singapore longer than expected. We were with our five year old so we decided to go to Sentosa. I was NOT happy about it and came in with a fairly bad attitude. I was pleasantly surprised. It's basically like going to a giant theme park so as long as you expect that, you'll be ok. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go there if I didn't have a child but we all enjoyed it as a family. Easy to get around. Very clean and safe. Some great light shows (actually much better than expected). Some fun restaurants for kids. My son thoroughly enjoyed his visit and still talks about going back."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Stayed in Hard Rock Hotel. Nice ambience, friendly warm and helpful staff. Best of both worlds, shopping and nature at the doorstep."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,The queue for each of the attraction ride took to long.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Visited resorts World whilst going to Universal Studios. Sentosa Island has a variety of different things to entertain you whilst in Singapore! Look online for the best deal.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fun and relaxing place.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The place was full of things to do, shops and restaurants. It is a great place to spend a day (or two or three) having a lot of fun! But things are a little overpriced as per usual in these types of places. Great fun though!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is a nice place to visit for all ages. The planners endeavour their all visionary ideas in an amazing reality. I always thought if I would have been to create such excellent place how I should have been taken this job to out perform the time.My salute to those were making this spot a unique one in Asia.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Excellent!! Amazing!! Once in a lifetime experience. It is a must visit kind of place. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Kids had so much fun there. They have made it something like heaven on earth!!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice view..awesome
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's like a dream land.. lots of activities and fun.. u have bars, shows, resorts, adventure activities, beaches, music, u name it and you have it here.. I had a wonderful experience here"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Stayed at Hotel Equarius for a staycation, the room is huge and spacious but that was about all the plus point to it. Not sure if it is due to COVID-19, everything seemed to be scaled down in terms of amenities, whatever was provided was reduced. No housekeeping was understandable because it's only a 2 night stay - minimised contact due to COVID-19. A little disappointed to be honest for a very premium hotel branding. Still a comfortable stay nevertheless, still felt exclusive and away from home. Could have provided extra amenities tissues or utensils to facilitate the stay. Odd that they only have 1 balcony chair though."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"This is a pretty nice place to go to have a good time. It is a bit out of the way and tough to deal with taxis/elevators if you have smaller kids, but overall they have lots of good stuff. It's worth a visit for sure if you just want to hang out and have a good time. Kids ages 6 to 16 or so will probably love it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Reception staff at Hard Rock Hotel were very friendly and helpful. Room is rather basic, nothing special. Festive Hotel is more interesting with bunk bed which the kids love. Adventure Cove was fun but it will be better if the flooring is not so rough."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa offers a wide variety of entertainment. The aquarium is simply stunning with highly detailed information about each fish. There is a museum about trade and industry, and various ships at anchor on the quay. There is a walkway back to the mainland with a travellator taking you through 5 different areas of botanical interest.
A magical place to spend the day with plenty of interesting features for small children."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great place for the family, lots of things to see, fun and games and of course restaurants, cafes and snacks. Rather big so lots of walking around. Great place to spend a day."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's touristic. Just perfect in serving our guests
Of abroad as well as our local Lot.
Need a good break and lazy to travel afar.
It's Resorts world Sentosa."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of the most soothing places in Singapore is around the Sentosa Islands. It's near the Universal Studios and totally worth the time to explore. 💯
Good Photography spot & worth the time to hang out with friends. 💙"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's an amazing experience and the visit to Singapore is incomplete without it. We enjoyed the Madame Tussauds trip and the cable car ride. The atmosphere was incredible as we went during the Christmas holidays. An absolute recommendation if you are visiting the country.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Beautiful place to visit and hang out with friends and family.. so many activities and things to see and do around. One needs a whole day to spend here.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"If you're visiting the USS, BUY UNLIMITED EXPRESS to skip the long queue"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Never come across so quiet at RWS. Even the food court are so quiet too.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,No doubt less crowds compared to other days... it still kepts the original favour of the past as always... do lookout for deals like other days
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Full of energy and enthusiasm here is most beautiful sea aquarium.Very nicely arranged with the aquatic world. They maintain it at the best. A very big casino is here where everyone must visit. Hi t passport is essential to visit casino.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very good place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"S.E.A Aquarium was great, with many beautiful fish and other forms of marine life. The tanks and exhibits were well maintained and designed, and the music and lighting complemented the atmosphere."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Love this place so much. As u know it's a tourist attraction. For those who are on Budget, just go in to the casino for some free drinks and who know u are lucky enough to bring extra cash back home 😂😂"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Had an amazing time here with family. Food was scrumptious and well prepped as it took no longer than 5 minutes to arrive. Had an amazing time taking the rides as well. Cylon is one of the rides that i recommend daredevils to take as it is definitely not for the faint hearts. Mummy is another ride as well for thrill seekers as it is one of the rides that will be right up your alley. Despite the looks of an inclement weather on the day visited, family and i still managed to visit the entire Universal Studious. Definitely recommened everyone to visit USS at least once when visiting Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Fun place to spend the entire day at. USS is here too. A few halal food options available as well although be prepared to pay more for it. Prices are all expensive. A lot of walking to be expected but still manageable except maybe for the elderly.
Had fun with friends and family here!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"If you look at the complex as a whole, it pretty much has everything you need, minus a supermarket! Between hotels, restaurants, aquarium, theme parks, cafes, casino and monorail, resort worlds is a great place to base a family for any Sentosa adventure. Yes everything is pricey but that goes with the territory. The forum or festive walk has a great vibe and even late at night, you feel safe, no obvious police presence but doesn’t need it. The crane dance at 8pm (free) was a nice little bonus, but if I stay at Sentosa again, I would look to stay at one of the resorts in resort worlds complex."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Haven't actually entered the hotels, but the overall environment is pretty lively with tourists on the usual days. Shelter is adequate for moving around but wear light as there are plenty of heat and Sun where the attractions are. The beach is also just a stone's throw away."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The little island that holds many thrilling experiences for the whole family. Starting from the cable car ride to the monorail and assortment of  entertainments - Universal studios, Underwater Marine Life etc. You can get a good package deal on the net. Worth every penny. Worth spending every effort to make it here. My family loved this !!!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"For me as a first timer to visit it's an eye catching
Love SG.more fun,"
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Too many people. So crowded. No crowd control
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"So much to do! Great fun for the whole family!
Water fountains and bathrooms everywhere.
Service is great and the people are genuinely nice.
I'm glad the people are helpful and communicate well because the signage can be a tad confusing.
I wish there was an 'all attraction - multiple day pass' of some sort that gives access to all parks (including universal) across however many days you need.
Food is expensive but shouldn't come as a surprise. I liked that they don't have plastic straws or lids!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fun attraction place
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice place to relax and meet friends
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Wonderful island of Singapore. Go once and you start finding reasons to go there again and again. It's not one day trip, it's not possible. But guys, please plan your holidays with atleast three days slot for this amazing place. Go there , do picnics, enjoy Harbor views, enjoy beach, there are cable car and mono rail metro facilities, amazing food court. All age groups can have great fun over there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very good entertainment. Value for money. Very nice place. Lot of things to do.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"I visited the Universal Studios within the Resorts  World Sentosa in May 2019.
Nice place with nice rides. Waiting times were long during the day, and the weather was hot, but the queues dissipated by evening time and was able to go on all the rides I wanted.
For thrill seekers, the Sci-fi roller coaster and the  roller coaster in Ancient Egypt are must rides.

Overall, a lovely theme park I would love to visit again."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A very famous place of singapore where this place got a award from tourism. You must go this place, this is a place where you can enjoy with your friends and family."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's huge and worth the charges. Food isn't too expensive inside. It's great for kids, teens and adults all together.
Do carry the map with you to cover the place completely and reach well in time because each ride takes upto 30 mins waiting too. (I went twice around Christmas and new years)

Wear shoes and comfortable clothes. Don't be tacky, you got to walk a lot."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"It was a bit expensive but the location was great for our planned itinerary. Lots of activities and places to go within the immediate area. The concierge was friendly and helpful. The rooms and hotel areas were kept clean in spite the huge gambling crowds that gather in the lobby. Our Room was spacious even with an extra bead. Sleeping was very comfortable. The only noticeable lack of was merchandise in the Rolex store and some boarded up areas. Nevertheless, This is a hotel to be considered for the next family vacation."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,"No luck, rain"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Never short of things to do here at RWS. Always something to do here around every corner.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Good place to spend time with family. Children and young adults will love it. Go for it!

Resorts World Sentosa,4,Sentosa is very very big place full of different activities. The place is beautiful and exciting but a little confusing too. Since it's so huge there should be someone or some means to guide properly the visitors. There are four different parts and travelling from one part to another can be done through metro station at free of cost. Other means of travelling are chargeable. Your package might have some activities at one station and some at other. So first of all you should approach a information centre and know where your activities are. Else all your time will be lost in searching the places. The luge is the best. Sea Aquarium is very nice. And the live shows are very interesting!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"its the smallest theme park I've ever been but, almost every places got a ride and rollercoaster. it's good cause you don't need to walk too much. Everything is just nearby. You can't miss their show. Make sure to check the schedule of every show before entering the park! It is AMAZING!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The S.E.A. Aquarium is wow!! There's something for everybody on the island. It's easily accessible. You can easily spend a day here and not be able to see everything there is to see (within your budget, of course). I would suggest taking the bus tour, because you get a quick view of the whole island, including the residential areas."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice relaxing stay at Sentosa.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Interested MG place to visit. Plenty of shops and restaurants and of course the casino. If you have a few hours free well worth a visit
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"If you like rides, Universal is the place to go. Outside some great eateries & the candy shop, with wonderful Gelato."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great place to visit. Walk in is free. Enjoy the sea  view while you walk in though the bridge
Resorts World Sentosa,5,We like it. A lot. Lots of fun rides and attractions. The ambience is awesome and you feel really excited to be here. Always a good place to bring the kids. Check express tickets but not a must depending on your timing. Have fun and enjoy !
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Show hand will be good here
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to visit. Have beautiful greenery locations. Kids will enjoy. Very relaxing place. Lots of fun activities for kids and adults.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to visit in Singapore. Too much rush on weekends so its better to have express pass on weekends. Rides are also good. Small as compared to Universal Studios in LA but ticket is also cheap. Overall wonderful experience.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,This year no christmas theme in that area outside USS. Seem very empty.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Parking was ok $9 for 7hrs
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The place is so fun!🤩 There are lots of restaurants and space to scoot, cycle and have fun! I ❤ the hotels and the swimming pool and the jacuzzi. There are ample space in the hotel room.😍😁👍"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It was amazing!!! All of the activities were so interesting. Especially the crane dance.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Loved it. Good atmosphere and well kept. Very friendly and well informative staff.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is a great place and I don't think that anyone could be bored of this place. A must visit place in Singapore. One shall factor in a full just for the Universal studios and another day atleast for other activities on the island.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Location is perfect. Cleanliness is good. However, staff is not polite as compare to other five star resort. Don't have much veg option.. Overall value for money.."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Scary place to work
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Lost money area......
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Loved the evening atmosphere at the Palawun beach with the sunset and the cool breeze..!

The hanging bridge is fun to cross especially for kids, but they do need parental support for kids lesser than 5 years old."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Such a marvelous experience. Experience of fun, joy and happiness. This island is having everything where a child and old age people can enjoy. One must visit this place once in a lifetime. Remember to spend ample of time here."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"This place was great but not the best, wait times are out of control even for the most basic of rides, nearly all the restaurants and refreshment concessions are shut at 5.00 pm and the park is open until 7.00 pm. Overall top notch rides but spend the extra to get express lane privilege."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A tourists attractive island with  entertainment, hotels, beach, resturents, landed residential houses, casino, museum and much more site-seeing destinations. Hidden  tunnels leading to the main land built before Japanese occupation but partially sealed and closed. Cable Cars are a fantastic breathtaking view. Good place to visit yearly."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Wonderful place for the photographer to take the interesting photos with friends and families. Avg you can spent 1hr inside. Although there is App for 3D AR, the photo resolution is restricted by the App."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,No doubt good place to spend a weekend. But min two / three days are required to complete all adventures / events in the island; better book a hotel there. Kids would enjoy most!
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"One of the most interesting casinos in the world.There are many slot machines and tables for roulette, baccarat, blackjack. Free entry for foreign passport holders."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Woooow world in Singapore.. must and best place to visit.. fully fun and excitements.. power packed place in Singapore.. the best !!!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Gets your heart pumping...
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Love it ,"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Visited after going to the aquarium. Whilst the place is very clean and tidy, there are plenty of restaurants but that's it. Lacks any real vibe, seems very plastic and false. Monorail was very handy though. There is a real lack of signage or anyone around to ask questions."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is a travelers Paradise and totally amazing for activities for all ages. Kids enjoy and so do adults. Learning and fun go hand in hand! Universal studios is a must do ( suggest if there is a huge rush then please buy the Express pass). It will take about 4-5 hours bare minimum to see and explore this. Other activities are S.E.A. Aquarium; and the trip is not complete without a visit to Candylicious store!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place needs days to clear every single attractions and food. The typical attraction prices for entrance and food. Try to buy online for the tickets to avoid queueing. Today went to Sea aquarium. Pretty awesome and peaceful. U can actually sit and admire the school of fishes and at the same time picnicking...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great day out in Singapore. Range of rides from children to adults. Fantastic
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Crowded but nice place still
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Wow place.  Enjoyed every second.  Universal Studios is great for children and adults as well.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,You definitely only paying for location and not the hotel itself considering it's not cheap at all
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Amazing place to visit with your family! Kids would have blast there, super clean, fun and relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended 5 star!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It's one of the best places ever to be visited in Singapore, the lion statue along with its sound and visual effects is amazing. The island has been served with all you need to have fun and enjoy your day whether it is relaxation on the beach or thrill at one of the amusements."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great place for family & friends to have some fun activities through out the weekends. Also as a great destination that can't be missed by oversea tourists. Come to experience it by personal!!!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Its a one place destination for tourist. Has great food. Great fun and awesome beach. Travel via monorail to different station to enjoy the attractions
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Great rides. Unfortunately because of the holiday period had long waiting lines. Recommend express tickets if visiting during holidays
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing place... Many wonderful attractions. You should come and see it yourself.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"What an amazing place to explore. The huge main plaza not only connects people to the theme parks Adventure Cove and Universal, but has a selection of restaurants and shops. There is also another level below everything of more shops to encounter. There is also an infusion of Americana in this area near Universal and the Hard Rock Hotel."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Excellent place for kids. ...enjoyed a lot. ..a full day is not sufficient .. There are so many rides and shows...everything is included in one single ticket only...price is almost 4000 INR. Must visit place in Singapore.. You can avoid to visit this place   if you flare travelling to Singapore.  Just loved it
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"It is a wonderful place to visit with your friends and family. It has got everything for the whole family. You can have spent the whole day there. Love this place, it is very clean and tidy.  This is one of the main tourist attraction place in Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I really loved this place.. Everything you need is there... Fun and exciting i had a great weekend thanks for the beautiful memories💙❤💚💛💜
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Integrated resort. Lots of food, from local delights to award winning cuisines. Wide variety to choose from. Not so much of shopping. Universal Studios Singapore can make up for that with It’s fun, exciting rides and entertainments. Definitely a great place for family and friends."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place in Singapore to entertain yourself. So many fun things to do here.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Had been to universal Studios. Good one but not preferred to visit during crowded days. Crowd management is very poor here. Most of the rides were having a waiting time more than 90 minutes.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Leisure place near to Singapore main land. Easily reachable. Too many things to do there. Specially for childers. Enjoy the day and night colourful.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,All attractions are good. Waiting time other than express takes is too long. Some rides are very short and it would be good if they were a bit long like 60 seconds more.
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Not bad for a family day out but the whole place is shallow and plastic. Lacks character and depth. Good place to go if with young children who are too small to understand too much.  Far more interesting places in Singapore to visit with far more character. Easy to get to with only a short walk from the main island.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,One of the best place to relax in Singapore and it's lot of activities to explore
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nothing much going on this Pandemic period. Few business have shut their doors.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very good service. Excellent breakfast. Clean room but still could be improved.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Really nice place. Lots of things to see and do. Can easily spend a day just walking around. Should spend at least 2 days here to get the best experience.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"All you need for leisure & entertainment for the whole family. From young kids to adults. I recommend to stay in one of the hotels in the resort. You can walk from  hotel to Universal Studio, Adventure Cove water Park, S.E.A Aquarium, the station and some other places."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Best place in Singapore where you can spend good time... I feel 3 days are required to completely see and involve in all activities...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good service despite the current situation
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing. Mind blowing. Everything is awesome thr. Indian food is a challenge there
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Awesome one of the best place in Singapore.

But too rush over the weekends, but still we can enjoy a lot with Family and Friends.

Price starts from 65 Singapore dollars and another 10 dollars extra for express pass."
Resorts World Sentosa,1,Don't waste your money. Luge is good. Butterfly park. Is it a butterfly park really. Charge for things which are not upto the mark
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Slight upset with the food around resort world .. there's not much varieties for muslim... Sad
Resorts World Sentosa,4,High end mall with high end shops
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Cool place in general. But also a classic tourist ripoff. You purchase tickets that grant tokens (starting at 55 tokens.) You can use the tokens on various things but alot of stuff isn't included in this system and nobody tells you that. No safeguard on the beach aswell.
Resorts World Sentosa,2,The place is good but everything inside Sentosa Island is paid and you have to pay individually for every game or sport you want to play..greenary inside is beautiful.the laser light show is mind blowing.one can't get the same concept anywhere else.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Aside from the Disneyland which is the happiest place in the planet, visiting Universal Studios in Sentosa is the next fave place. You should try their mummy ride, the long line was worth it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Even if there is no show, some food stalls are closed it is still the best time to visit as it is not crowded and most rides waiting time is less than 15min"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Awesome place. Cable car, luke ride, sea beach, bikini bar, wings of time... all are phenomenal"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"There's lots to see and do here. Can spend a day outside of universal studios. However everything is expensive, except that there is some free and less interesting things to see."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Nice place to unwind and relax. Lots for the kids as well with thrilling rides, water parks as well as memorabilia. Nice hotels  too in case you would like to stay within the resort which is  recommended since it's quite far from the city.

Exorbitantly expensive though ! With the rides, restaurants and hotels digging deep in to your pocket when compared to similar places around the world!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice weather and clean
Resorts World Sentosa,4,A place to be visited must in Singapore.. Nice ambience and having full of activities. The light and sound show is superb
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Best place in the Singapore. Fun unlimited, activities unlimited, island itself like a new world. Must visit. Shopping, Garden, Beach, Ground, Restaurants,  lots of Selfie points, kids ride ... All are available here. They have set up mono rail also which is accessible free of cost. If you don't want to spend money then also there are many attractions which make yr day memorable... Too good and well maintained."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Got money must go there spend pls, heaven"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A magical place! A good balance of heartstrings-tugging rides for trill-seekers and more relaxing ones for kids. However, things can get pretty expensive here. But other than that, a very fun and enjoyable place for family and friends! 😄"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Clean, well organised and most importantly fun!!!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Nice view out, there's two facing, one is the inward /pool facing, and the other is the outward one. Staff are friendly and polite. The shower is a little lower pressure than I expected, probably those water saving things.

Room is very big, though only with with seat. It would be nicer if there is a sofa.

Overall, a great place for staycation on Sentosa."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Super awesome place. Must visit once if you are visiting Singapore. The visit includes lot of walking around and you may get really exhausted, but it's totally worth it at the end. Each and every attraction is a must go. I would suggest to get the 20 credits full pass and have a frolic day here!"
Resorts World Sentosa,3,Generally a good place for family holidays and not much else. The shopping wasn't for adults and the historical attractions on the island weren't easy to get to from the resort and require a fair bit of walking in the humid weather. The casino isn't too bad. Plenty of food choices on the resort so you will never go hungry.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"THE BEST PLACE EVER. Don't miss out on this beautiful, magnificent, breathtaking place when you're in Singapore. This place is simply magical, that's the only word you can use to describe it. ❤️✨❤️✨"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place is pretty cool. Yes it is cool weather there due too it is in highland. Only take 1 - 2 hours from KL. I am amazed how they made this place very reachable by cable train or bus.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The waterpark was amazing. Great place to spend the day with family and kids.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,nice clean relaxing
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Avoid weekend, plan accordingly. If you have no choice and going by weekend take fast track tickets to enjoy all events."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Absolutely amazing place with everything for the whole family. From beaches to rides to museums to shows. Rides for safari and also wonderful food places. We and our two kids loved spending all the time there. We will visit again soon.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Experience of a lifetime! They provide free shuttles and trains to get around Sentosa World. It was a 5 STARS experience. They have literally everything! Hotels, attractions, casino, shopping centres."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place for a break
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is a fun ride.
One day is not enough.

You can buy $4 ticket for fun train which has 3-4 main stations inside. I would like to suggest you that grab a map after buying the tickets. It will help you to cover most of the attractions here in Sentosa.

I saw SEA Aquarium and did sky luge. Better to buy online tickets to save money."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Tacky and touristy, also expensive. Nice during COVID-19 period as there were very few people there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This place is a tourist paradise. Have amazingly progressed and changed in the last 10 years. (2007-2017). Great experience for a visitor. World class attractions. When paired with Universal Studios, it becomes a complete package to enjoy your holidays with the world class rides like the Transformers ride and the Mummy ride, which has the only indoor roller coaster in the dark."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Wonderful small island full of activities. Universal Studios,  casino, ifly, bungee jumping and swings. Its a fun day for kids and families. You can catch train from vivocity mall or buses. Taxi , go grab also available.  Greatly organized and lots of things to explore."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Need a lot of time to properly see the Resort attractions. But still we enjoyed.
Resorts World Sentosa,1,U  see
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A very beautiful place. One of the major tourist attraction in Singapore. A lot of fun activities to do here. Weather is little hot and humid but still you will enjoy. There is show called wings of time, that is a must watch."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Had so much fun here! Sentosa island is worth visiting, spend some time in universal, the rides were fun 👍🏾"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good place
Resorts World Sentosa,3,I think we were too old for this. Ideal for families. Visited on a Saturday from 11am and it was very quiet.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Good place for tourist.  Got a lot of activities for kid and adult.
Week end & public holiday is very crowded."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,cool place for locals as well as tourist

Resorts World Sentosa,5,Come and be dazzled by the magnificent sight of our Supertrees and let the music and lights entertain you in our daily Garden Rhapsody light and sound shows! With Hotel BOSS
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"A must stop for visitors but as an expat here, we rarely go. It is over priced and busy with tourists, but it is a place you should visit. I recommend just walking there along the board walk and taking the gondala."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Good relaxation and enjoy place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Fantastic place! Loved that it offered so much within the complex.  From a variety of accommodations,  attractions like universal and dining ranging from fast food to fine dining, it really did have something for everyone."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Overall it's an awesome place. 1 star less as casino isn't that great for poker players. Minimum buying is 500 - 3000 sgd  Mostly you will find players with nothing less than 1500  - 2000sgd at the start of the game. No lesser stakes than that available
Blind are 10 - 20."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great parking space
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to have a short get away. Some attractions have long queue but totally worth it. Better buy the express pass if u wanna skip the long queue. And rent a locker as well for bags and loose items as some rides will require you remove them
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice ambience
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Total bliss..I would recommend this to all.  Most beautiful tourist destination in the world.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The island is cater to all from toddlers till probably 60 years old(if you still strong to walk 5km doing marry go round the island), toilet is clean all the time, good music around the area, different theme park to enjoy by different preference. The ticket price is a bit pricey but worth the experience! Recommended to go for all ages😊"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Superbly well-designed resort. Great architecture, service and facilities. Although everything is pricey here."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"With ample activity options all around and the best of dining experience as well, this is the place to be at. Pretty well done and one could easily spend 2 days trying to make the best use of time across various options. Sign boards certainly need to be better and perhaps larger so that they are visible from all around.
Free water needs to be available."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good customer service
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great place to visit when you in singapore a huge one stop entertainment. From casino, theme park, aquarium, shopping malls and others. Prepare full day to enjoy this place. Dont forget to bring your own lunch especially for budget backpacker like my family do."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Friendly staff and clean amenities
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice walking trail from vivo to sentosa
Resorts World Sentosa,4,I feel its expensive for no reason. We have Disney in the usa so I cant fly all the way to Singapore for this. There is several restaurants here and there is also a casino for those who would love to gamble. If you have never been to a theme park then this is worth your visit.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"LOVE this place. Clean place to hang out with friends and family. Lots of things to do, from shopping to casinos to amusement parks. Very fun place."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The one-stop super getaway in Singapore, it offers a luxurious host of attractions for all ages. Whether you're looking for an aquarium for the family, a theme park for adventure or just a relaxing time at the beach, RWS has it all, some at extremely affordable prices too!"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great day. A lot to keep you busy. Clean and easy to navigate. Staff friendly and helpful. The photos they take of you, where you can collect when you exit are ridiculously priced. Insane. I refused to purchase on principle."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's a wonderful place to visit if you are in Singapore... Thrilling rides. Must watch the water show.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Good place to visit on a weekday. Never a fan of a purchased express pass so no 5 stars. The wait time is ok, staff is very efficient. All in all, a good day spent with the family."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A very good place. The universal studio is amazing but you need to have one full day for that. The water park is not that big but it's really fun for all ages except for really small children ( min hight should be 120 or in some rides 110). I loved and enjoyed in these places. The SEA aquarium is good and you get a free ticket for the museum with it. Good place for a person who liked aquariums. One of the best aquariums I've been to. The other thing is trick eye museum. Very good place and if you're photogenic it's the best place for you in this world. In general this place is really good and worth a visit. Also it has all the variety of restaurants so you don't have to worry about food.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"6-8 Jan 2020.
First trip in the year of 2020.
Had a good moment with my family.
We took Sentosa Rail to Vivocity for free, because Hotel provided free tickets for hotel guest."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good food and entertainment before circuit breaker..
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"We went on to the ROYAL Albatross, my second time on the tall 4-mast ship. It was always treated with luxury. We had more cocktail than we could finish. We held our corporate event there. This time with the anti vertigo pill, I didn't have seasick, unlike the first time which was super miserable for me and I couldn't wait to get off the ship. This time however it rained so we had the roller plastics drawn down for awhile. The deck was of course wet and slippery but the crew ensure we had a good time by watching for our safety. The food this round was fantastic and I got to speak with the captain as well, seemingly from New Zealand. Just a guess. I saw many couples booked for a romantic dinner with live singer at the Hull. I also went over to stand to the front of the ship to watch the fireworks at sentosa. It was beautiful and a magical experience and I highly encourage people to sign up for the experience. I had also asked many of my friends to try it."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"It's huge and cannot be explored in a day. So make sure if you are going to Sentosa, keep 2 days for that. A lot of interesting activities to do and shows to watch. Start early and finish late, you'll enjoy it!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,The place was beyond your imagination. Like a dream. The pictures you see on the web will not do the place any justice. Visit Sentosa if you have the time.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very easy to spend entire day here. Keeps adults and kids both entertained.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,The swimming pool is good. Room is reasonable. Close to team parks and other facilities.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Whole Sentosa island is a fun place. Rides, bars, casino and restaurants of different budget are present. But better avoid the Mdm. Tussauds wax museum... if you do not love Indian film industry."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Went to this place during December holiday with my relatives and definitely it's packed.
Tips : You better go walking with zero fee than queueing up for train if you want to go in faster during holiday season. It's around 15 mnts walking and it's still bearable & fun for sightseeing as well tho."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very good place.. must to visit in Singapore.  Cannot miss luge ride.. it's two big..so keep at least whole day..or two days.. lot of fun activities.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice. A lot of interesting places to explore. Need to make a few trips to visit all the great sites.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great experience, nice place so much to see and do, excitement to be had for all ages very easy to spend a lot of time there great place to spend time with family and friends very much worth a visit as there is so much for all tastes"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place to chil
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"This place is amazing and the reason I give 3 starts, its toilet cant lock however it such a good place"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Very well projected in view of covit 19 pandemic.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Singapore itself is a marvel and when you specifically visit Resorts World Sentosa, you're transported to a paradise of thrill and delight. It is to the credit of the people managing this unique place that even with hordes of people coming regularly it is maintained breathtakingly clean with ease of mobility. Visit Universal Studios and SEA Aquarium. Forget the kids you're going to be yourself floored by the action packed adventure rides and the variety of fishes sharks etc. You can go to the casino and also see the  Sentosa Merlion."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"One of our itineraries, during our SG vacation, is to meet with our friend and her siblings.
We had dinner at Singapore Seafood Republic at Resorts World Sentosa. If you are in the mood for crabs, then it is a place for you. You must try their chili crabs! But their salted egg crab is a good bet too!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Free entry by car till end March 2021
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It's worth the walk. Fun place to be in if you're in Singapore. Amazing crowd on Saturdays.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Amazing to see this island created for fun and adventure. Plan your day in such a way that you can cover Universal studios, Sea Aquarium and other major attractions here. Most of the attractions have queues with waiting time upto 2hrs.. Its good to plan your visits post noon where the crowd is less."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The event was held at one of the room, and the food and drinks a nicely presented. I'm impressed by the staff professionalism in hospitality of the guests. Surroundings are clean and spacious. Stage and AV system are great. Nothing I would complain much about. It just blend in. Just the car park was quite a maze to me. It is not easy to find the right place to park my car that is near the convention center. The sign board wasn't very clear and it disappear after awhile of following it. Was quite fustrated actually. Other than that, the experience was great. I be back again for sure."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is a must visit family spot to visit in Singapore. A great experience. Lots to do. This place seemed to have every theme park from hershy, to universal studios, rides for kids, zip lines, oh my the list goes on to theaters, exibits, museums and the largest aquarium in the world.

They also have a park with cable cars to see the city and luge cars to ride down the mountain."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Visited the S.E.A life Aquarium and Maritime museum. Spent some hours exploring both and enjoying both immensely. The museum was quiet whilst the aquarium was very busy. Beautiful displays in both.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,great
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Lots of attractions and easy to get to. You can use a cab all the way there or if you're on a budget take the train from vivo city to Sentosa; it's free!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This is a must visit place in Singapore. It is a little island which is completely entertainment based. There are many rides and shows which will blow your mind. There are options of buying fun passes which are to be used while you experience the rides. There is a huge Merlion which will fill your tourist heart.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Spend a day to joy and playing the rides. Just pay few $$ for sky train and find some good spot, restaurant and sight seeing"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,The wonderland of Singapore. This is a big tourist attraction. Technically all the tourist attraction that are located in Singapore are located here. This is small island in the down south of Singapore. It is well connected by local transport and taxi. If you are 3 or more people then I would suggest taking a cab is a very good idea because tickets via train are also $4 per person. It kind of comes to the same thing. Return is free via train so just take train when returning!! I think cost wise works out better!! There is a entry charge when you taxi taxi but totally worth it if you are sharing cab and entry changes.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Sentosa world resort is very well known. It had been covered in large area with having amusement parks having kids playing areas
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Awesome place...... We r enjoyed so much in this area...
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa can be reached by cable car or mono rail. Note that metro pass will not work on monorail and separate ticket needs to be purchased. If you prefer cable car, Sentosa entry ticket tokens can be redeemed for the same. SEA aquarium is must visit. Trick eye museum is also fun for kids"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"i miss the mono rail sighting, so relaxing and leisure"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Entertainment to its best. Come here for 3 days still you will not be completed experiencing allbthe activities available on this island. Its home to Universal studio theme park. Its a must do once in a lifetime
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Upscale place. Gambling options. Good eateries. Reduced price of you become a member. Membership is free.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of the must visit places in Singapore. The island has a lot to do over a weekend. But three days can be leisurely useful if you have planned for a long trip to Singapore. Sentosa, along with universal studios make a Great getaway for a short as well as a long weekend ."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Best place to wander.
Everythig gets on one place. You can go for casino or universal studio and my favourite spot silosa beach"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Definitely visit this place when in Singapore, else your trip is incomplete. Sentosa is an island in Singapore and holds a lot of attractions to exoerience. Do visit the Sea Aquarium and Universal Studio when you come to Sentosa. Luge is another experience which includes Cable Chair from bottom to top and Bike ride from top to bottom. I had amazing experience here, hope you do too :-)"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Excellent place for spending your day. It has sky ride with luge ride. Cable car with superb view. I dint like Madam Tussauds  much so same can be avoided.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"The place is a great tourist destination as there are many things to do there such as visiting Universal Studios Singapore, Casinos etc. The staff there are definitely helpful in aiding the visitors so it was definitely a great experience. The trip there wasn't too bad either as there is a cable car express way. Overall, I would definitely visit the place again as it offers a great getaway to the robust city life."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Amazing place to spent time with friends and family. It has got rides for both kids and adults.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Singapore is incomplete without a visit to Sentosa island. They upgrade every 5 years so the look and the feel is always amazing. Best attraction is the aquarium. Tunnel viewing is superb. Adventure activities are safe.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,nice and relax room
Resorts World Sentosa,2,Looks like another mall with lots of eateries. SEA aquarium is not open.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Fantastic place.  Lots of things to do and see.  You could easily spend two days here with a family.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A hell of a lot of fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This universal studios super cool and a great place to see and visit when you're in Singapore. They're fun things to do for kids and for adults.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"The resort islands, One of its kind.. must visit!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This is the best place you could ever visit. Here you have the universal studios which is the main thing. Don't forget to try some rides in universal such as the transformer 4D, cyclone and human roller coaster, the mummy and the Jurassic park ride. It's worth it"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Must visit.. kids will love it.. in fact every one will love it.. visit the aquarium and studios .. good food ..
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"By far the best theme park I have visited. I haven't been to the US yet, so cannot compare to some over there. But along with Universal studios and other amusement sections, this clearly stands out above the rest. Great experience any time of the year. Must visit is if you are going to Singapore."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice of Garden by the Bay.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Perfect place to spend an entire day. Might need a few more days to explore the entire island. A bit expensive
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa is truly amazing. You're going to need more then a day to explore the wonder and beauty of the islands. There some great attractions and offerings including the cable car ride. If you happen to be do go for the Wings of time, you won't regret it"
Resorts World Sentosa,2,No maintenance looks old
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Really amazing place. The entertainment here are totally mind blowing. The food stalls had great choice and catered to everyone's Pallet. Overall had an awesome time.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Wonderful place to enjoy with friends, family or solo. Be sure to checkout their special deal of it is your birthday. You can enquire about it from their Guest services counter at the entrance. Upon verification you will be given a badge which says its your bday along with coupons/vouchers that grant you discounts on purchase of food and merchandise."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"A lovely Resort with such a lot of recreational activities to do. A must visit destination in Singapore for foreigners or even locals. A place for the entire family to be, and much more enjoyable when visited with friends. The Resorts World Sentosa has many attractions such as the Universal Studio, SEA aquarium, Casinos, dolphin island, adventure cove water park etc and also many restaurants. There are hotels also incase you would want to stay for few days.. However the food is more expensive in the RWS than usual, but you can fine dine or take away your meals as per your preference.  Typically you will need a full day to spend here and make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes. :) You can reach the Resort by Taking the RWS8 Bus from the harborfront station. You can also go there by Sentosa Express monorail from the Vivocity which is 4SGD,  or by a taxi, which is an expensive option or even take a cable car. The cheapest way is to walk by taking the Sentosa Broadwalk through VivoCity. Tickets to all attractions can be purchased at the entrance or through the official RWS website. If you decide that you don't want to go to an attraction, still there is alot to see and look around at and chill. It's a place to suit everyone's taste and there is something for someone. In overall, it's a great experience to be here and a perfect place to enjoy and have fun at any time of the year."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great for kids as well as for adults..
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It is an amazing experience!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Had a great time with my family. It's a wonderful place. Lots to see and do. Will recommend.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Great place to visit by a family. Lots of things to enjoy, and it was one of the best places I've been in Singapore. Only bad thing is that it was too hot🥵."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Beautiful place to spend the day. Luge ride is a must. However, it's better to have a separate day for Universal Studio and a separate day for the rest of the attractions like marine aquarium, etc."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Massively popular well established top-notch resort with loads for all ages to enjoy. The aquarium was especially spectacular and beats my home town of London hands down.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"We were invited to dine at the 3 Stars Michelin's Restaurant at Hotel Michael. My hosts told me that restaurant will close this Saturday. The restaurant is classy, service is fantastic and the ambient is simply marvelous. The food is chic and great. You have savory the last bit of it. It is really a pity that it is closing."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"So hot, not enough air-conditioned places. wished I was quarantined in the hotel when I was overheating. Drinks are expensive af"
Resorts World Sentosa,2,"I’m extremely disappointed with the team at the hotel reservation service and lack of professionalism over the phone conversation as I sought help from RWS regarding my hotel booking in end June which I made through third party booking app Trip.com. I was first contacted by Trip.com to be informed of the hotel closure on my period of stay and was advised to cancel the booking and receive a refund on my credit card. However it was not a feasible solution as I’ve terminated the credit card and will not be able to receive the credit refund thus I requested for an amendment of the booking to a later date. Since then, there has been countless back and forth between Trip.com and RWS which were shifting responsibility about being unable to amend my booking - the former (Trip.com being in direct contact with me) stated that RWS is unwilling to amend the booking even if they were to amend the booking on their platform. Thus, I contacted RWS directly instead to request for them to make the change on their end. RWS responded that they were unable to do anything as this is a 3rd party booking. I then went back to verify with Trip.com which said that when they make the amendment on their end, RWS will still need to make the amendment on their end. I then called RWS again to seek their assistance to make the amendment on their system - and at this point is getting incredulous that they are unable to do so. Apart from the blame shifting, I’ve also received condescending response from the RWS CSO explicitly correcting me in a curt tone that “it isn’t Hard Rock Cafe; it’s Hard Rock Hotel” which is utterly uncalled for. Despite my frustration dealing with the lack of accountability from both Trip.com and RWS to assist in resolving my issue of simply making an amendment to the date of stay, the blatant attitude and response from my last exchange with RWS is the last straw. I expected better attitude and customer service from a 5 star hotel even if they are unable to offer a proper resolution.

*update: Trip.com has since updated me that RWS proceeded to make the amendment to the date. Thus, I’ve added 1 more star for this review despite the ordeal. Hope this review will help others that have encountered similar issues with RWS or other hotel bookings."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Nice place for family bonding
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Nice view
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Great food options
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Lots of good food
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very beautiful place... You can enjoy many tourist spot.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Visited the Hard Rock Coliseum for a concert. Venue is open air but had adequate cooling through fan jets located at the side. Staff were helpful and well prepared, crowd control was effective. However there was no clear signage directing to the venue and there was no information desk near the entrance to request assistance from."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Perfect family vacation, a must visit place, and it needs at least 3 nights to be able to complete most of the attractions. We stayed in Hotel Festive, the stuff is very friendly and cooperative. All attractions are walking distance, so my advice is either stay in Festive, Micheal or Hardrock and rest assure you  will have a wonderful family vacation."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Not enough shelters and fans. Universal Studio queue is long and customers are exposed to the natural elements of the hot&humid weather. As for the Wet&Wild, and the Sea Aquarium, need to say that these two attractions are far much better than Universal Studio."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Very nice Tour place. Cable car drive very pleasing and great enjoyment.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Just mind blowing. If you are an adult or a child, you can't miss this place. This place belongs to everyone. Fun, frolic, games, fantasies, movie characters, etc. What not. Everything is there. Just land on this island and then experience like never before. In one person, if you visit Singapore, then don't miss this place.

Better to take the Cable car service. And, enjoy the ride over Santosh to take a trial view of it."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,I was at sea aquarium! it was my first visit there and I went with my partner. the museum at the start was pretty cool and informative! but the ship simulation (in the dark with lots of ropes) stank. we enjoyed the aquarium a lot. I love sharks and was very amazed and delighted at their numbers when we first entered.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A place with lots to offer from Butterfly park to Madam Tussauds 4D adventures and many more. Has beaches where people can spend quality time. Has internal bus and train services which helps to cater the huge area. It take minimum 2 days to visit the whole place. A must visit for all.
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Be careful of the free lockers. They allow 75 minutes free but rides during peak hours will definitely end up with you paying somewhere from $3 to $6. It is recommended to get all day locker for $20 from Jurassic Park locker as it allows multiple open/close. Also my recommendation would be to never go on a holiday as you'd not be able to visit all rides and events.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Always serves as a high quality destination for meet ups over lunch/dinner and is a good place to have your meal after a day at Universal Studios/Adventure Cove/SEA Aquarium. The only negative I may point out is its price point. However, having such good service throughout the area does come with a price."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Always feel like a whole new world yet so uniquely local in Singapore....never fails to make feel enchanted and just feeling away from home plus prepping for Chinese New Year the Year of the Rat
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"It's a great resorts but unfortunately I only passing by this resorts, as usual Singapore doing a great job to keep maintaining their tourist spots. Keep the good work Singapore!!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Excited to have this destination as one of our itenararies. Next we will have some other places to go in Spore.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Cool theme park, very American. Fun rides, more appropriate for children from age 7 and up. Loads of fun thrill rides en coasters. Children will have the most fun if they are familiar with movies like Shrek, Jurrasic Park, Transformers, Madagascar etc."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"All programs r super
Under ground sea super
Light show is awesome  super👌
Cable car
All can enjoy"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Amazing recreational area. heaven for tourists. From roller coasters, water slides, indoor sky diving and michelin fine dining. This one has everything for everyone."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"Obviously, it's a pricey place. But I suppose, it comes with the territory when the Big Honchos of Genting Group are targeting well heeled visitors from around the world. I've to admit, walking through the different attractions does make me feel like as if I was in Europe one minute & Japan the next, so I guess in that sense, I simply feel a bit overwhelmed at times..."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Its a must to come here at least once, as this place has good and fun ride. But, it is recommended to purchase express pass when you go, as the queue is crazy, even in normal days."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,gaming is a way of life and this resort will take your money on and off the tables. if you can stay away from the games of chance (the house always has the favor) there are enough activities to keep you and your family entertained for several days. bring lots of $$$
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great resort. Location brilliant. Makes getting to all the attractions in the area a lot easier. Hotels are all great quality.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Epic. From universal studios to the beach to the Mega Adventure. It's a great place for tourists!
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Best holiday destination. Enjoy till you tired TO sleep. Fun and lot of adventure
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Rope car ride and monopoly rail are fascinating. All the amusement rides will attract youngsters. Very friendly and caring staff.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"This place has so much tk do that you might have to come back next day as well,. It's main attraction is Universal Studios which is a different adventure all together. The Sea World Sentosa is another place to spend quality time with your family specially with kids. It's little crowded on weekends so make sure you reach here early to make the best of everything."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great place to spend a weekend.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Good beach. The light and sound show is worth watching. Sea aquarium is magnificent
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Should go there if you at Singapore. Good for kids and adult. Universal Studio Singapore, Casino, beach , also many goods restaurant"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"An excellent place for holidays. Needs at least a couple of days to fully explore it, ideally three. We spent a couple of days. USS was by far the most favourite place, followed by Aquarium SEA and Maritime Museum. Festive walk is also good option to stroll around. Couldn't go to the beach due to weather. However, Adventure Cove Water Park, although well maintained and well designed, was underwhelming. Maybe it's because we visited Sunway Lagoon earlier that exploited our perspective.
It is best to stay in the resorts hotels to be able to get max time to explore the place and avoid the hassle and cost of transportation to and from the city centre."
Resorts World Sentosa,4,Lots to do and see. Food area inexpensive. Good portions. Beach area good for swimming
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"What more can I say?! Spend the day there or even better, spend 1x week & you'll have the time of your lives!"
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Ooooh it's a world on it's own. Beautiful.  Arrive early,  you will be shocked how time flies"
Resorts World Sentosa,4,"Great place, bit over priced for what you get versus other places around the globe. excellent for kids with plenty  to do .  Can be very congested with large amounts of  pushy/rude Chinese and Indian tourists. Staff could not be more helpful , polite and happy - if only going for a day do your research as there is so much to do and see."
Resorts World Sentosa,3,"It’s a great place! Very busy on even a weekday. I had to wait in long queues. As compared to other theme parks, queue management here is a little slow. The
good thing though is that they have accurate wait times displayed at places, so you don’t have to go across the park to find out. The Galactica ride was the highlight! It’s great park, however they must do something about the crowd. There’s just too many people. And express costs double for the ticket, which doesn’t even make sense, cause then no one takes it."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Sentosa Island such a great and fun place to go. Inside it many atractive parks and shows. There's also has a casino, but I never had a chance to go in. Unfortunately this time when I came in Dec 2019 (just now), the weather is so so very hot. The Siloso beach and Sentosa beach were occupied for New year eve, so we can't play or walk in the beaches so sad. We can only had ""A wings of time"" show to watch, I think ""Song of the Sea"" more attractive and more storyline (just my opinion). You better try it yourselves to Sentosa."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Iconic place. Lot of activities. Wonderdul place to enjoy. Go in the morning.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,If you visit Universal studio and do not know how to schedule and where to go within limited time then go to water world stunt show which held two specific time a day.  4D Shrek is also a nice show and afternoon you schedule to go transformer ride if u schedule it in the Morning you may encounter 2 hours long q.  There still had many interesting rides and also watches and play but the above mentions are my best preferences. Drinks and food there will b more expansive.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,This place is an Island in Singapore.   A tourist attraction place for tourists as well as local people to enjoy.   There are 3 Star to 5 Star Resort Hotel to cater to different budgets.   The most prominent attraction places are the Casino and Universal Studios.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Perfect for tourists and expats. Transport into and around can be an issue but nothing too complicated.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,Great experience.. must visit if you are an adventurous soul and like fun rides. Luge was the most fun.. you can race with friends and see who gets the best control and speed.
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Anyone who is visiting Singapore should visit this place. It has so many places like Universal Studios, SEA Aquarium, Adventure Cove Park,  Trick Eye Museum, Maritime Museum, etc. Please plan your visit well and early, Universal Studios has so many attractions that will require you one whole day to spend there. You can pair up Trick Eye Museum, SEA Aquarium and Maritime Museum in one day. Adventure Cove Park will also require one day time to enjoy all the water rides."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"One of best attractions in Singapore. Can reach by cable car, monorail, bus and taxis. Recommended by cable car. Can easily spend three to four days. Universal studios, SEA Aquarium, Madame tussauds etc are located there."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Place for everyone in the family.. Plan for covering all places in 2 days. Rushing through the resort in a day will leave you super exhausted and de-hydrated. Book in advance for wings of time show. There is a free crane dance light and sound show at 8 PM, reach there 20 min in advance."
Resorts World Sentosa,5,It is a good place
Resorts World Sentosa,5,A lots of fun things to do. Great place to have fun
Resorts World Sentosa,5,"Singapore has done an amazing work at bringing the tourism here,  both local and international visitors, are seen enjoying themselves here!

Many activities to do here,  from the casinos,  the themed parks  the eateries, the shops, the hotels and many other more within the Resorts and the island itself.

This place is best explored within 2 days minimum or more to truly enjoy the facilities and activities."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"Thankful to have been invited as a guest. A very warm, family atmosphere. Service was very welcoming. The grounds were extremely well kept. Food was delicious and a mix of western and local favorites. It felt as if you were no longer in Singapore. I didn't see any buildings at all from the rear balcony of the restaurant. Amazing."
Singapore Island Country Club,4,We had a fantastic day on the Island course! Was pleasantly surprised by the pace of play as I was really expecting a slow round. The course itself has plenty of undulating terrain and makes you work to get around it in one piece. Greens are slick but well maintained. Nice bunkers and fairly decent layout. One less star for the amount of mud you come across. Many times I had a plugged ball or some much impeding a shot. I know it’s hard to control during the rainy season but seems they need to improve drainage. Clubhouse and restaurant were quite impressive as well. Hope to be back someday!
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Nice & challenging course.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,A Saturday breakfast was made very pleasant by the beauty and scenic view from the restaurant..
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Always enjoy this old course .. keeping the old nature with challenging green. Don’t expect a flat fairway even you land your ball in the middle of it... Long par 3 that you may need a driver at hole 18 else you expect to walk down to slope and up again... the clubhouse facility is great with clean showroom. The food served was yummy at the restaurant inside. Plenty of parking and friendly staff to assist you..
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Eateries now under reno but can still order takeaway.  Svc always pleasant and professional.  Facilities restricted due to H.A. restrictions for now.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Nice tea break.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Guillemard Cup champion in 2015/16; Represented Club in inter-club league games in number of years when Sicc team won the chsmpionship.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"I went there for a New Year's Day lunch with Uncle Ong, Auntie Yvonne and grandma's friend.  The food and the ambience were super. It was a good way 2 kick-start 2021, with good food and banter  with my cousins."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Nice place for all and also kids good restaurant nice food too
Singapore Island Country Club,5,I love the restaurant Silk 😋
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Just love it. The most beautiful spot in Singapore
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Good environment here.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,great foods great place
Singapore Island Country Club,3,This place is ok. The food at the restaurant here used to be good but now is so so only. The portion of food has reduced.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,👍♥️💞💓💕💖👍
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Exclusive Country Club but 2nd only to Bukit.
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Nice and cool to have breakfast while looking at green and surroundings which make make feeling its day to go for food days are ahead for great start!
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Love the views and natural old trees.
Singapore Island Country Club,1,"Staff are rude and lazy

Bryan and Vincent are the ones"
Singapore Island Country Club,5,The place fantastic hight class
Singapore Island Country Club,1,Place for elitist ppl to mingle lol
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Nice and quiet place for Relaxing.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"I'm fairly sure this is the most incredible Country Club in Singapore. It's secluded location really makes you feel like you've left Singapore. The facilities are incredible, the staff lovely, and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend getting in here for dinner sometimes. It's truly lovely."
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Nice place. Easy access to treetop walk right beside it
Singapore Island Country Club,2,Was at the Bistro. The laksa was terrible aa agreed by my 3 other buddies who also ate it.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,A very nice place!
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Good restaurants.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Luxury. Nice pool. Good food
Singapore Island Country Club,1,Very poor service and management. Canceled my wedding solemnization 10 days before my actual date without good reason even though MOH and MOM allow solemnization in private function rooms for up to 50 pax due to COVID.
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Private club reserved for those who can. Probably the top Country club in the country. Buildings are somewhat bare and space but expansive. Top golfing ground .
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"Ballroom is nice and big with plenty of space to mingle and chat with other visitors. The view from the balcony is also really nice. The service by the banquet staff was also very good. They respond nicely to requests and are attentive to the needs of the guests. The food served for dinner was also really nice but the best part was definitely the dessert buffet. Overall, it's a nice place for a banquet(wedding dinner, D&D etc.) and I hope to be back soon."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Love the tranquility of the place and great restaurants!!
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Been a member for the last 30 years.  One of the premier clubs in Singapore.  Great golf course and terrific restaurants.
Singapore Island Country Club,4,One of the oldest and prestige golf course in Singapore. Played on the new course.  Hilly and well maintained course with lot of trees on both side. Challenging on some of the holes.  Part of the course are just next to Macritchie reservoir. Surprises to big fans blowing on players to keep us cool. Be careful of the monkeys!
Singapore Island Country Club,4,"A nice place with a nostalgic good feeling about it...

Sort of like a coming back home feeling!

It's after all the grand old dame of golf clubs in Singapore😊"
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"The views from the resultant are great and the food is quite good.  If you have a chance to spend some time here, you wont be dissapointed."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"Beautiful and breeze. Only for members and they can bring their guest to enjoy the food, golf and Chinese Restaurant."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,So beautiful
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"The club has 2 locations. The Sime Location at Adam/Lornie Road and the Island Location at Thomson Road. I’m writing about the Island Location. There is a Chinese Restaurant on the topmost level called Silk. Not expensive, and decent food. The salted egg fish skin is miles ahead of everything you get on there in a packet. Try it and you will know what I mean"
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"This is the place to be to play glamourised golf. OK joke aside it's a great place to play, with lush surroundings. Nice restaurants within the club, great facilities such as bowling alley, and a huge following of guests at the bar looking to dance the night away."
Singapore Island Country Club,3,Course conditions not great due to recent raining weather
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Big place if you like golf this is the place to go a sojourn in a city comes with a lot of amenities and rooms to stay too ample parking and I think major events are held here too
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Simply the best club in the  entire country! Big thumbs up x 2.
Singapore Island Country Club,3,The Grand Ballroom is a nice place for a Chinese New Year dinner. Food is not too bad but getting home is a big issue when you don't drive.Uber or Grab does not always come in. We had to wait for a while before we got a ride.
Singapore Island Country Club,2,Early morning sight especially to feel the morning dew and a great early morning misty condition and lots of fresh air.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"Me and my wife really enjoyed the October fest.Food was really good with lots of varieties offered,  the drinks package was even better. Thank you for the fun filled event."
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Nice course. Nice club house.
Singapore Island Country Club,2,"elite club for rich and well known, members are socialites and super rich."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Good place to hold a wedding cerenony and dinner.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"Fantastic place..and fabulous food..
Good nice ambience.."
Singapore Island Country Club,4,"Had lunch over there. This is a private club and membership is required unless you are an invited guest. Has a 18 hole gold course, swimming pools (Olympic size included) and a bowling alley. Nice ambience."
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Extensive facilities and the Chinese Restaurant called Silk. The food was quite impressive.
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Very friendly reception and staffs.  Course are well maintained
Singapore Island Country Club,4,"Oldest golf club and now very few such clubs left. Nice restaurants here to. If you look at names of members, they’re the VIPs"
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Place very serene. Service crew very attentive & dedicated. Local food is good. Worth the visit.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,It is a private membership golf club. It also has other facilities such as a private should have. There are 2 full courses there. There are also restaurants and catering services for members.
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Great variety of food at reasonable price although average environment.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Wow the reception area at the SICC Upper Thomson is majestic with its high ceiling. The Christmas decorations are beautiful to look at and the pipe-in Christmas carols provide additional ambience to the place. Great Job!
Singapore Island Country Club,4,Good food at decent price. Very good and friendly service.
Singapore Island Country Club,5,"This place is for members and their invited friends. Non-members are
NOT allowed to enter. Very expensive to join this Golf Club Entrance Fee currently is S$190,000"
Singapore Island Country Club,5,Food and dessert in the Silk restaurant was good!

Saint John's Island, previously known as Pulau Sakijang Bendera, is one of the Southern Islands in Singapore. It is located approximately 6.5 km to the south of the main island of Singapore.

St John Island
The Story
john island
Saint John's Island formerly housed a quarantine station for cholera cases detected among immigrants in the late 19th century, and starting from 1901, victims of beri-beri were also brought to the island. By 1930, the island gained world recognition as a quarantine centre screening for Asian immigrants and pilgrims returning from Mecca.

The quarantine station was eventually also used to house victims of other diseases, such as leprosy. When mass immigration was closed in mid-20th century, the island was used to house a penal settlement and also a drug rehabilitation centre, but all that has changed now into something totally different!

This island, was the site of Sir Stamford Raffles's anchorage before meeting the Malay chief of Singapore in 1819.

St John's Island,1,Very disappointing. Most of the island is currently closed to the public including the beaches and toilets! Wait until mid 2019 when the renovations will be finished to visit!
St John's Island,1,Very small beach and polluted water
St John's Island,5,Back to nature
St John's Island,5,"(Translated by Google) Good morning

(Original)
Selamat pagi"
St John's Island,5,"(Translated by Google) It takes about 20 to 45 minutes from Marina South Pier, depending on the boat you board.
It seems that there are two companies, and the counters are lined up. The fare is almost the same, but at the counter on the right side, I got a $ 3 voucher for Gong Cha. It seems that it is more popular, and the return flight is a long line.
I felt that the counter on the left side had a few flights, but the number of people using it was small, so the ship was not too crowded and was comfortable.

Lazaro Beach is probably the cleanest beach in Singapore.

There are no shops, so don't forget to have a drink.

Please note that there may be sudden rain. (There are not so many places to hide)

The beaches on Kusu Island are not so beautiful, so those who want to play on the beach should go to Kusu Island after playing enough at St. John's. One hour is enough to see Kusu Island.

(Original)
乗る船によってかかる時間が違いますが、マリーナサウスピアから20分から45分ぐらいで到着する小さな島です。
2社あるようで、カウンターが並んでいます。ほぼ運賃は同じですが、向かって右側のカウンターではゴンチャの3ドルバウチャーがもらえました。そちらの方が人気のようで帰りの便は長蛇の列です。
左側のカウンターは多少便が少ないように感じましたが、利用する人数も少ないので船も混雑しすぎず快適でした。

ラザロービーチはおそらくシンガポール内のビーチで一番きれいだと思います。

売店等ないので、飲み物をお忘れなく。

突然の雨もありますのでご注意ください。(隠れるところがそんなに多くない)

クス島のビーチはそれほど綺麗ではないので、ビーチ遊びをしたい方はセントジョーンズで十分遊んだあとにクス島に行くのが良いです。クス島は1時間あれば十分みて回れます。"
St John's Island,5,"(Translated by Google) It’s quiet and the water is clean, especially the semi-circular bay of Lazarus Island, which is very beautiful.

St John's Island,4,"(Translated by Google) It takes about 30 minutes by ferry from the mainland.
As there are two ferry on a weekday, you need to be careful about the time.
I don't sell food or drinks, so I bring it from the mainland.
There are a lot of people fishing.
It is a very beautiful and peaceful island, ideal for fishing and picnics.
Beaches are recommended to walk to Lazaro Island.
There are a lot of mosquitoes and sand flies, so please take measures against insects.

Marina Bay Sands Casino,5,"Beautiful place and good staff service. Free soft drinks & tea for customers. As long as you Gamble responsibly nice place. Before covid very nice place to hangout with friends.
Different levels for smokers & non smokers

Mid week catch & in Ruby Marina #needavacation"
Marina Bay Sands Casino,4,"BEST CASINO i have ever visited. It is situated at the base of marina bay sands. Entry is FREE for foreigners if u show your original passport. When u enter inside the casino you will see a new world, u can try your luck to win some SGD.

Guests will be greeted with soft drinks . ROBOTS will be on its duty to serve water and soft drinks to the guests and players. Vending machines is placed in every corner of the casino soo that u can have some hot milo old cold coke.

one bad thing i would say is the players inside are allowed to smoke in the table itself which is a big minus. it affects the non smokers too

overall a very nice place not only for the players but also for the guests."

Marina Bay Sands Casino,2,"I am a regular casino visitor.
Thou the casino starts to open today, I am still much worried about the protocol.
I had been to RWS casino and their protocol is much ideal as they only let gold members and above ; and/or people with per annual entry levy to access.
But for your side is, regardless foreigners or as long any1 whom could just pay the per day entry levy could become member and walked in easily. The risks is more compared with RWS. Making business is priority but in this situation now, if your side is still so laxed, I think this deep cleaning issue would relapse again.
Please take into consideration.
Thank you."
Marina Bay Sands Casino,1,Very poor derive by security shardha lady mshe don't know how to speak with customers.we are come here not begging for play but she behave like we are coming her beging
Marina Bay Sands Casino,1,"Security at entrance don,t observe distancing. Lower patron mask to check is very unsafe. They need a glass panel or any media as viewing."
Marina Bay Sands Casino,1,A broken heart and an empty wallet awaits you here.
Marina Bay Sands Casino,2,Stalls should put a notice to remind customers when their unit is closed instead of having everyone going there to find they are not operating on that day! Something should be done about birds zooming down on tables to eat scraps as soon as people leave the tables. It is not hygienic and cause disturbances to others who are still eating!
Marina Bay Sands Casino,5,Great services and friendly staff

Marina Bay Sands Casino,2,"Good place to visit and look around for foreigners. Otherwise, stay away, many have gone bankrupt and suicided."
Marina Bay Sands Casino,5,Beautiful casino
Marina Bay Sands Casino,3,"Pre-covid times, It was a good place to hangout and have some fun and try luck.

But during covid times you will get frustrated to even spend 30 minutes in casino. They have implemented some out of the box social distancing measures. Even if couples are roaming around holding hands, there social distancing ambassadors will keep on buzzing around and irritating you.

Bottom line is, if you are a desperate gambler, you can play solo and enjoy. But if you are a person who visits casino just for fun. Better avoid visiting, you will feel more relaxed anywhere else than MBS casino."

Freshly prepared food with healthy ingredients tender loving skillful cooking and warm services in spacious  lounge relaxing atmosphere. Walking distance to KFT Karting Circuit with car racing every now and then. Friendly cosy comfy welcoming ambience for romantic intimates groups students expats locals visitors and families."
Singapore Turf Club,2,Food was bad. It looks ok but the taste is bleh.  Location is very inconvenient.
Singapore Turf Club,5,This is very big place for horse racing. I didn't enter this place for horse racing. Outside looking very nice .some time i was travel by mrt aboard I saw nice view of this club . This covid moment temporarily closed .  It's near by kranji mrt station . This place need buy tickets
Singapore Turf Club,5,"It's a place that holds horse racing. It's hug place. It's far from the city and hours racing is amazing to watch..of cos many people are here to gamble. The racing ground is so nice and green. The racing is so well organized. It's my first time to see yourself racing as well, I placed a bit but did not win."
Singapore Turf Club,4,"Arrived here for a Friday night race, good atmosphere and vibes. The staff are very friendly and patient with explaining how the betting works. The corporate boxes are slightly aged but still offer a great experience."
Singapore Turf Club,3,"Nice place to chill out in the evening, if you are not a die hard gambling fan. Besides watching the races, you can get to see the horses in closeup views when they are out for parading before the races."
Singapore Turf Club,5,There to attend a private event. Well treated by the host. Spectacular view of the racecourse. Friendly staff at the betting station.
Singapore Turf Club,4,Was here for Shilin Night Market. Very spacious parking however at a steep price of $6 per entry. Very huge area and a lot of walking to be done.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Excellent location for racing with healthy grasses and beautiful flowers greeneries. Clean tidy orderly quiet location with spacious garden. Friendly fast attentive cosy comfy ambience for romantic intimates groups students tourists Expats locals and families..
Singapore Turf Club,4,"For those of you who like a little ‘flutter’, or want to experience an evening watching the sport in an ultra modern air- conditioned grandstand, a visit to The Turf Club should be on your itinerary. Avoid Grandstand ticket entry, might be the cheapest option but do you really want to spend 3 hours in 30 degree heat and 80% humidity ? Choose The Victory Lounge or (if I recall correctly) The Derby Lounge (approximately $30SGD on a Friday evening). Food and beverages readily available. The electronic boards are a little confusing so take your time before betting. This can be a fun evening without spending or losing too much - good luck."
Singapore Turf Club,5,Team building event very nice
Singapore Turf Club,5,Bet till you drop
Singapore Turf Club,4,Nice view and great sunset. Didn’t see any horse race tho. 😅
Singapore Turf Club,5,This good  place  😍😍
Singapore Turf Club,5,Best place for live exprience of horse racing

Singapore Turf Club,4,Wonderful place to watch horse racing and unwind
Singapore Turf Club,5,nice hospitality
Singapore Turf Club,4,Great evening out. Bit of a journey to get there but normally 9 races a night.  Makes for a nice evening out. Food and beverage stands there and if your lucky enough to get a grandstand vip room. TOP drawer evening.
Singapore Turf Club,5,"Miss All You Guys and the Fun of Cheering the winners,Foods with Fish and Chip down with Tiger beers and Joy of winning some bets under the Stars on Friday Nights and Under the Sun on Sunday Afternoon.

Singapore Turf Club,5,Great place for the Sport of Kings
Singapore Turf Club,5,I have nice experience to enjoy 🐎 🐎🐎🐎
Singapore Turf Club,5,"That was super performance
Thanks 😘"
Singapore Turf Club,5,The only racecourse in Singapore and one of the best in the region. The facilities are well maintained and the place is great to watch live racing (and try your luck on bets). Singapore races are on Friday night and Sunday.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Great place!!
Singapore Turf Club,5,A horse is a horse of course of course
Singapore Turf Club,3,"Smokers everywhere on a Sunday! Foods and drinks are available in various stalks and foodcourt within the Turf club. Level 2 aircon are not open to public. Plenty of seats, TV monitors and sales counters in level 1. Lots of shouting for favourite horse number during race. You may not like the place if non-smokers or gamblers"
Singapore Turf Club,4,So many horses...
Singapore Turf Club,4,"This is a nice facility with a good setup. It'a ways out and if you're in a car or taxi you have to double back around a long way from the highway, but it is fun and interesting once you get there. The food and drinks are decent, too. A good place to go for horse racing."
Singapore Turf Club,4,nice place to hang out. Location is a drive away. Its a nice afternoon out
Singapore Turf Club,5,It is a good place for entertainment
Singapore Turf Club,5,Nice place very good
Singapore Turf Club,5,A group of 5 went to the Turf Club using the entertainment package we purchased in Australia before our trip. The food and drinks package was excellent with a great outlook over the whole track. We were escorted to the mounting yards and looked over the horses prior to racing. We bet and had a great win. What more could you ask for in a night out. I recommend this to all visitors to Singapore. I have been to Singapore 15 times and I still find new things to do with my friends. Come and enjoy like we did.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Always fun in the boxes for a good night out. Could do with a better selection of beer other than just Desters which is below average.
Singapore Turf Club,4,So quite as no more horse racing
Singapore Turf Club,5,"Great facilities. Thanks so much to Prof John Yovich and Steven Tan. Definitely come here again soon. A fantastic day out in Singapore, even picked a few winners"
Singapore Turf Club,4,"Noon time air-conditioned is only 23 degree.
I not bid favored horses.in class 5. I like bid second or third by forecard only $2 each ticket.  about 3 hrs spent."
Singapore Turf Club,4,Interesting place for first-time visitors. Bet once just for fun but don't get addicted
Singapore Turf Club,3,"Food at the lounge area is nice but if you are not into horse racing, this is not the place for you. The customer group of the higher and lower levels are very different and the public areas tend to get rowdy and noisy when the races start."
Singapore Turf Club,5,"Great, authentic experience if you are into horse racing. Particularly in the general admission section, there are virtually no Western foreigners. Admission 8 S$, 6 S$ if you pay with EZ/Nets. There is heavy smoking, just fyi. Do bring a pen, as you cannot just call your bets at the counter."
Singapore Turf Club,3,Nice information
Singapore Turf Club,4,sheltered foot path from kranji mrt stnt all the way
Singapore Turf Club,5,Hands down the nicest thoroughbred racing facility I've ever visited.
Singapore Turf Club,5,"You not only bet the local horses races but you also bet
country like Australia, Korean, Malaysia and etc horses races...The turf Club is a exciting and first class well equip place with good view to watch the horses races..."
Singapore Turf Club,4,Interesting experience. Huge Viewing gallery. Variety of food options. VIP options available. Go-karting available within walking distance.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Awesome!! Bought some stuff there but the jam is crazy. Never have I seen so many people before in a small confined area.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Fine place.
Singapore Turf Club,2,"The turf club is very entertaining
also if you know something about
racing  you can go and pursue it
as a pastime."
Singapore Turf Club,5,Open to public on most race days from Tuesday to Sunday. It was built and officially opened in 2000 and was just recently refurbished in 2017. Entry on race days is by ticket payment. No children are allowed on race days.
Singapore Turf Club,4,"Enjoyed the experience here on a Friday race night. Location wise is right up the North of Singapore near Woodlands, so expect some traffic if making your way during peak hour. As race tracks go it's got everything, including corporate boxes, function rooms and a ringside area where you can get really close to the horses and jockeys. Oh and yes, it does have betting with the booths taking cash only. Atmosphere wise it's certainly no Royal Ascott or Flemington as the vibe much quieter and perhaps a bit bland, but we still enjoyed the experience. Certainly something different to do in Singapore."
Singapore Turf Club,2,Noisy n overcrowded during race days. Food n refreshments limited n expensive. Quality is at best average
Singapore Turf Club,4,exciting but not restrain pls
Singapore Turf Club,5,"Brilliant! A great night, service as usual top class."
Singapore Turf Club,4,"Beautiful ambience, food served is ⭐⭐"

Singapore Turf Club,3,"Its gambling,money is a concern,dont waste on gambling"
Singapore Turf Club,5,Good..
Singapore Turf Club,4,Good place to spend time watching horse racing
Singapore Turf Club,2,"Nothing to be excited of unless you like to watch or bet on horse racing. After watching few matches, the non interested people will be bored to hell. However, the food being served in the VIP room was pretty good. The site is conveniently being served by MRT line with lots of parking lots. Distance is quite far from the CBD area."
Singapore Turf Club,1,Completely not worth the time. Was at turf club for the shilin market.
Singapore Turf Club,3,"Only great for horse race fans..  cheap food price and better hangout there with friends,  if you go alone you'll be lonely"
Singapore Turf Club,5,"Come on lah,it is a race course. Ofcourse nice lah"
Singapore Turf Club,5,Good fun but left a load of money behind

Singapore Turf Club,3,I was there for the Shilin Night Market. There are 2 rows of Taiwan Street food stalls that had long queues formed awaiting to have their ordered to be taken and order to be severed. There were less cover at the rows of stalls selling Taiwanese goods and services. There is also a section for arcade games that was also pretty crowded.
Singapore Turf Club,5,Nice complex!
Singapore Turf Club,5,If you feel lucky go for a punt.It's fun but not if you lose big.
Singapore Turf Club,2,"Many people lose their savings , assets and family by Soccer betting and Horse betting here"

Singapore Turf Club,3,"(Translated by Google) Directly connected to Kranji MRT station. An admission fee of $ 8 was required. It was a night game that day, and the final race started at 22:00.
It seems that the dates are irregular, so it is better to check the schedule officially in advance.
You can buy a betting ticket with a mark sheet type.
There are many littering and smoking, and the atmosphere of the iron fire place is not like Singapore. Cheers and hecklers are also intense.

If you like horse racing, it might be worth the trip.

Singapore Turf Club,5,"(Translated by Google) Visited in September 2017.
There seems to be a dress code for the time being, but I don't seem to need to be particularly conscious because I put a T-shirt, shorts and Crocs.
The atmosphere is the same as a Japanese racetrack, and it is a beautiful racetrack.

In addition to Singapore horse racing, Korean and Malaysian races were bet.

Betting betting is as follows.
Win (Win)
Place
Forecast (Maren)
Place Forecast (Wide)
Tierce (3 units)
Trio (triple)
Triple Trio (Gives three triples in three designated races)
Quartet (single quad)
Double (Win one of two consecutive races)

Win and multiple wins have a minimum bet of 5 SGD. Otherwise, the minimum bet is 2 SGD.
It is a form that is described on the mark sheet and purchased like Japan.

Note that the display format of the odds is different from Japan.
For example, if the winning odds for a Singapore horse race is displayed as “12.0”, it is 12 times in Japan, but in Singapore it is 12.0 ÷ 5 = 2.4 times because it is the odds for the minimum bet of 5 SGD.
Betting tickets with a minimum bet of 2SGD will also be odds against 2SGD.

It is a racetrack in a foreign country, but screaming on the last straight line is universal and it is very fun ☆

2017年9月に訪問。
一応ドレスコードはあるようですが、Tシャツ、短パン、クロックス入れたので、特段意識する必要はなさそうです。
雰囲気は日本の競馬場と同じで、キレイな競馬場です。

シンガポール競馬以外にも韓国とマレーシアのレースも賭けれました。

賭けれる馬券は以下の通り。
Win(単勝)
Place(複勝)
Forecast(馬連)
Place Forecast(ワイド)
Tierce(3連単)
Trio(3連複)
Triple Trio(指定された3レースの3連複を当てる)
Quartet(4連単)
Double(連続する2レースの1着を当てる)

単勝と複勝は最低ベット5SGD。それ以外は最低ベット2SGDです。
日本と同じくマークシートに記載して購入する形です。

注意点はオッズの表示形式が日本と異なる点です。
例えばシンガポール競馬で単勝オッズが「12.0」と表示されていると、日本では12倍ですが、シンガポールでは最低ベットの5SGD対してのオッズなので12.0÷5=2.4倍となります。
最低ベットが2SGDの馬券についても、2SGDに対してのオッズになります。

異国の地の競馬場ですが、最後の直線で叫んだりすることは万国共通で、とても楽しめます☆"
Singapore Turf Club,5,"(Translated by Google) A racecourse representing Singapore where an international race was once held.
Although international races have been abolished and have not been played in recent years, there is a floor for foreigners, and watching horse racing from there is very elegant.
With two international races coming back in 2019, I hope that the horse racing in Singapore will re-emerge again and hope to come back soon.
Needless to say about the convenience and safety of the city here, Kranji Racecourse can be visited very safely, as soon as you get on the MRT and get off at Kranji Station.

かつては国際レースが行われていた、シンガポールを代表する競馬場。

1st Avenue Mall,4,"Nice shopping mall. Clean, well maintained and well lit. Unfortunately, the current MCO has caused many outlets to close, hopefully temporarily."
1st Avenue Mall,5,"I really like this mall, it is well kept and clean, and quite calm environment inside especially compared to Komtar and Prangin Mall. The less crowd is a plus considering that it is located right in the middle of Georgetown city centre. They have quite a number of famous outlets like Starbucks, Parkson, Texas Chicken and the only A&W in Penang.
There is also TGV cinema at the 8th floor.
You can also view the city from the Pavilion View Deck."
1st Avenue Mall,5,"A nice place to shop women's handbags and purses. Not too crowded place due to covid 19. Men's things also have but not too much compared to women. You can find kids' stuffs as well like toys and clothes. To me, the handbags is quite beautiful with affordable prices since they sell branded handbags."
1st Avenue Mall,5,A great shopping complex with varieties tenant. Enjoy your meal here at the ground floor and enjoy shopping. It is near KOMTAR in the city center. There are lots of parking spot inside the building and also outside it. It is connected to Perangin Mall with a covered bridge.
1st Avenue Mall,4,"It is a very good mall, clean , tidy but the toilets can be quite dirty and there is very little food options to pick from. But, other than it is a pretty good mall"
1st Avenue Mall,4,Medium range shopping mall.Good parking facilities. Popular with office workers.

1st Avenue Mall,5,Good place. Convenient parking. Great outlets.
1st Avenue Mall,5,A Nice and comfortable shopping mall. The car park is well organized.
1st Avenue Mall,3,New shopping mall in Penang. Located near several big hotels. Small but compact so quite many store inside.
1st Avenue Mall,5,Went here for a quick stroll. Clean and comfortable.
1st Avenue Mall,3,"Went there for hair treatment, if u wanna shop beside some of the brands. Is very hard to really enjoy the shopping feel.. Due to CMCO, cinema is closed too. So not really going there if wanna buy something.. not much variety..."
1st Avenue Mall,5,One of the most biggest mall this penang very nice to see this mall inside.
1st Avenue Mall,4,Huge mall. Actually several malls interconnected. I am sure you can find anything you want.
1st Avenue Mall,4,Might be due to pendamic Covid-19 less people in the mall.  I'm free to explore n take my sweet time
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Many flagship stores here
Less crowded than other malls"
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Good mall, well maintained, only minus is poor surau."
1st Avenue Mall,5,Best U Mobile service at first avenue mall
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Nice shopping mall. You can see beautiful view from the 8th floor, near TGV cinema."
1st Avenue Mall,3,"Watched movie here, Thai foot massage and bought some clothes at H&M and cotton on. Most shops clothes are not appealing. Dry Pan Mee at the food court upstairs is delicious."
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Found what I wanted to buy here, cheers"
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Most modern shopping mall next to Jens Hotel and walking distance from the Komtar centre. Used to have great food and beverage outlets. Big departmental store, Parkson, is found in this mall."
1st Avenue Mall,3,Simple mall neighbourhood mall with affordable shopping goods like sports apparel and clothes.
1st Avenue Mall,5,"Is sourranded by georgetown heritage, the mall has a great offers for big brands, i advise to take a look around in the tower 59/60 floor which has a view of the city and a restaurant is awaiting"
1st Avenue Mall,4,A good place to do shopping at komtar area
1st Avenue Mall,4,Not so many people which is good during pandemic. 😁
1st Avenue Mall,5,"My wife said she love to shop here.    Easy accessible, lots of parking,  next to main road. She manages to  buy a new handbag with discount last night and she's very happy about it."
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Pretty good, it's a big mall complex. You'll easily get lost inside 😉"
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Just another shopping  Mall , nothing different but each time me just park at this mall and go to komtar building."
1st Avenue Mall,5,Like this Mall a lot. Near to my holiday hotel and Komtar Interchange. Addicted to the LG A&W Root Beers. Two rounds in a roll.
1st Avenue Mall,4,"I remember back when the mall was constructed that this was billed as the Gurney Plaza for town centre dwellers, one which would make Prangin mall and KOMTAR great again. It's disappointing coming back after 10 years away that it couldn't attract the top retailers that are present in Gurney Plaza and Queensbay Mall. Not a lot of quality food choices and the food court is a far cry from the rich selection of the two aforementioned malls. Presence of Parkson is a plus but I noticed that the selection is way less than the one in Gurney Plaza. Overall it's a good visit during the pandemic since it's emptier than other malls."
1st Avenue Mall,3,A good place to get away from the hot weather as it is located in the heart of Georgetown.
1st Avenue Mall,4,OK n good mall in Georgetown.
1st Avenue Mall,4,A lot of shop close during MCO
1st Avenue Mall,3,"1st Avenue Mall is connected to Komtar and Prangin Mall via link bridges. The drop off area of 1st Avenue Mall is at the Parkson side. There are a lot of F&B outlets here: The Chicken Rice Shop, A&W, Texas Chicken, Starbucks, Kenny Rogers, Sushi King, Empire Sushi, Sakae Sushi etc. They also have a foodcourt on the top floor. Some of the shops here include H&M, Cotton On, PDI, Brands Outlet, Mr. DIY, Sasa, Watsons, Guardian, Cosway and Parkson. I wish they have a bookstore here."
1st Avenue Mall,1,Saw the guard did not scan the car driver and family members that heading to the multi storey car park.
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Another shopping mall besides KOMTAR building...not too huge but just great to stroll around. Among top shoplots there are H&M, Brand Outlet, Parkson, Guardian, Seoul Garden, Texas Chicken, A&W, Sushi King, Starbucks and etc.

There is connection bridge to KOMTAR building at level 4/5...not sure which level."
1st Avenue Mall,2,Generally the stores are below average. The food court had the worst tasting food compared to most places! A number of rude hawkers who care about only money and not quality or tastes of food. Never visiting this place again.
1st Avenue Mall,5,Shopping mall is huge with amenities. From sports shops to arcade to household stores to pharmacies to restaurant to cinemas. Whatever you need you can find it here. We had good meals at A&W with piping hot spicy chicken at our finger tips and fragrant Thai milk tea from ChaTraMue. Of course not forgetting reviving our childhood days at the arcades. Enjoyed ourselves very much having a convenient mall near us! Will definitely visit here again.
1st Avenue Mall,5,Parking price has gone down which is a plus point for the mall. Nice Christmas deco!

Popular food center, Cafes, restaurants ( Seoul Garden) ."
1st Avenue Mall,3,Things are not for most common people but very near to other mall and more parking space
1st Avenue Mall,4,"The most upscale yet smallest mall among the trio of Komtar,  Prangin Mall and 1st Avenue Mall converged in the centre of George Town city centre. Lots of choices for clothing, drugstore essentials, mobiles, 2 do it yourself outlets, a cinema, no fuss casual dining places, even gourmet coffee with the choice of Pacific Coffee,  Fortiga, Starbucks and PBC short form for Penang Best Coffee. Food Avenue offers lots of choices of local and foreign dishes. 1st Avenue Mall also has the most well maintained toilets compared to its neighbours. The car park is well lighted, its surface coated with a pleasant to the eyes green paint that ensures good grip for tyres. The incline and descent up the car park ramp is also kinder to the tyres compared to the cheaper car park at Prangin Mall.Even though you are charged RM 1 per hour,  it is better on the tyres and brakes if you visit the vicinity often."
1st Avenue Mall,3,"Seriously i can't find the toilet until i reach level 3.
Alot of shop"
1st Avenue Mall,5,"Good mall , all in one place!"

1st Avenue Mall,4,Connected ICT mall and Prangin Mall. Good to go while during pandemic. Cause less people.
1st Avenue Mall,4,"Great place to buy clothes, it's also connected to Komtar and Prangin Mall, so if you have enough walking in 1st, you can always go to the other 2 malls."
1st Avenue Mall,5,From 8th floor of 1st Avenue Mall

1st Avenue Mall,3,"It's surprising to find such a mall at the heart of the city but less appealing than other malls like Gurney Plaza or Gurney Paragon. Most clothing shops are locals, and only fews are good enough for me, Common Sense is one of them beside H&M. Ambience is fine, but needs more efforts on the interior."
1st Avenue Mall,3,"Very clean, hiegenic mall. Provide wide driveway of ramp compared to pragin mall parking mall. There are numerous of elevators but less number of lift especially for wheel chair and baby stroller have to wait in long time. There are plenty of eating spots Texas Chicken, A&W and more. Parking cost is reasonable than other mall nearby (komtar and pragin mall). Unless not parking for whole day. Because parking for whole day then pragin mall rooftop is better but the ramp up and down quite dangerous and the parking spot is very less in fifth floor."
1st Avenue Mall,5,"8th floor Cloud 8 is GREAT! Take the elevator beside Starbucks to the 8th floor and enjoy the view for free. Cinemas and arcades are also there with Tealive. 2nd floor connects to Komtar and Prangin. 4th floor is the foodcourt, which has decent options and prices, and DIY as well as Easy Homes. All in all a very enjoyable mall."
1st Avenue Mall,3,"It's a simple mall which that we still can sip a Starbucks coffee,few restaurants such as Texas n food court..the one n only A&W is here too.interlink with KOMTAR.but, there's no groceries department."

There is a food court on the 4th floor.
It looks bright and clean, but large rats over 30cm in length were wandering around the ceiling pipes. There is a hygiene problem. (In the first place Penang is full of rats)

Because you will eat in a place where rats are wandering overhead, we recommend a restaurant area on the basement floor.

Singapore Quarry,5,The Singapore less travelled! Easiest way to access is to park at Rail Mall and walk through Fu Yong Interim Park. Easy to walk for families and shaded path. A short walk from the park.
Singapore Quarry,4,"Nice quiet place easily accessible. Spotted some lovely colourful birds, if not wrong is a king Fisher with long beak. Orange and blue feathers. A family of monkeys and just only a handful of visitors. Serene place to sit and relax. Good for those who wish to take a breather before continuing with rail corridor walk. It was a cloudy and early morning day when we were there. Hence photos appear a little dark."
Singapore Quarry,4,"A good place for a walk or exercise. Can walk from the MRT, the Rail Mall or even detour from the Rail Corridor. There's a small stream along the way and you may spot a monitor lizard. The quarry is quite serene and can be quite hot."
Singapore Quarry,3,Part of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Nice place to exercise and hangout.
Singapore Quarry,5,"Dairy Farm Quarry was filled and the level surface is turfed, unlike the other quarries in Singapore which each feature a pond. The rockface is spectacular.
Unfortunately I see many photos and reviews here which show the nearby Singapore Quarry instead."
Singapore Quarry,4,"Peaceful and calm. It is a great place to hangout and talk with your family. I enjoyed the beautiful lake and of course wonderful plants. I really liked the way they presented the information to us.It is also a good place for fishing and hiking.
Overall,I recommend this place."
Singapore Quarry,5,Stunning View And Relaxing Environment
Singapore Quarry,5,"Rustic countryside, rugged quarry face, a huge jade-green pool surrounding us on the deck. There's always this light fragrance of the pandan plants all around."
Singapore Quarry,5,"Gd escape from the bustling city sounds. Monitor lizard, terrapins and fishes can be found swimming at the quarry"
Singapore Quarry,5,A nice short trek will bring you to this amazing view away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It was quite crowded on a Saturday morning when we visited. Many photography enthusiasts were also there hoping to catch sight of birds in the area. Do check it out if you wanna clock in some steps while getting close to nature
Singapore Quarry,5,Great view and one of Singapore’s hidden secrets... we hired a couple of mountain bikes from Unsprung bike shop - and headed out for an adventure. To be honest we didn’t know this place existed but was pleased to discover it. Very tranquil and picturesque more like Thailand than Singapore.
Singapore Quarry,5,Nice scenery...😊
Singapore Quarry,5,"A beautiful place worth visiting, great for nature loversI"
Singapore Quarry,5,"Another Good walking trails in Singapore.
Full of green and shades, about 1.5 hours walk to and fro Hillview MRT Station."
Singapore Quarry,5,"Awesome place after a long jogging. Bring your tea, fruits and enjoy every moment here.

Breathing in, I’m drinking tea
Breathing out, this moment is awesome"
Singapore Quarry,5,"A really great place to see the great quarry and away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. The place can get a tad bit crowded with all the birdwatchers but it gives it some life!

Besides the quarry, the trail towards it has some nice fauna and path for you to hike! The weather can be quite punishing in the afternoon but the trail isn't that long.

Overall, if you're around the area for the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, do take a trip down here to see Singapore's most popular quarry and you won't be disappointed"
Singapore Quarry,5,Serene and tranquil. Easy walk to the quarry. You can visit the rail corridor as well!
Singapore Quarry,5,Nice quiet place not much Birds but still worthy to venture
Singapore Quarry,4,"Great place to observe the tall granite mounds, fish, dragonflies and damselflies! Big fish can be seen at deeper end. 👍

The path up is relatively easy and accessible for both cyclists and pedestrians. Well connected to Rail Mall, which is probably the nearest F&B Rest stop."
Singapore Quarry,4,There is wide glassplot and connected to mountain bike path. A lot of mountain bike riders went throught this trail.
Singapore Quarry,5,Scenic spot... lots of birds
Singapore Quarry,4,"We parked at Diary Farm carpark A, next to the Salvation Army. It’s about an easy 1.2-km to the Singapore Quarry, wide paved roads.

It was very peaceful at the deck. Surrounded by the water and the trees.

The walk from carpark B is double the distance. Carpark B was full with lots of mountain bikers."
Singapore Quarry,5,One of the place in Singapore with nature. However it is a small area. Recommended to go.
Singapore Quarry,5,Lots of beautiful nature. Its heavy rain when we start walking. The children were just having fun. Can park yr car @railmall and walk in less than 10mins to the quarry.
Singapore Quarry,5,"Heard a lot of good reviews and saw a lot of nice photos of this this place. But when reached there, I was like ""Wow!""... awesome place. It was so different when seeing it in person. So peaceful."
Singapore Quarry,4,Nice trail for early morning walks. Gets too hot for me in the afternoon. Weekdays are quieter. Crowded on weekends and it’s noisy too due to the throngs of people. I only go there in the mornings. Check out my video to see what the place’s like...👍🏻 Oh yes! There’s a couple of really weird trees along the way... anyone knows the name?
Singapore Quarry,5,"The Singapore Quarry is a great place to come and relax during your stay in Singapore, as the water is surrounded by trees and makes for a calming destination.

The Singapore Quarry is also a popular hiking spot with a number of walking trails around the quarry where you can enjoy a quiet stroll."
Singapore Quarry,5,"It is a small cozy place for a light walk. Over here, you can ride your bicycles here, have a stroll and even jog! This is a quiet and peaceful place filled with fresh air.

From the start to the end it is about a half an hour walk. At the end you can see a quarry with a very stunning view. You can also see koi fish in the quarry and see dragonflies hovering on the surface of the water."
Singapore Quarry,4,"An abandoned quarry - Singapore Quarry, hiding away in the Dairy Farm Nature Reserve area. Accessible from Rail Mall via an asphalt / Granite road formally serving the quarry. Quiet and tranquil. Will maintained access road affords easy accessibility. Look out for the monkeys enroute, as they may snatch food from your hands. So I would suggest that you keep food away from sight."
Singapore Quarry,5,"You can access this place from a trail. The closest MRT station would be Hillview. After a short hike over rocky terrain, you reach this expanse of grassland. It is a serene area, and perfect for a picnic, especially in the areas that are shaded by the quarry."
Singapore Quarry,5,Beautiful quarry with breathtaking views
Singapore Quarry,5,Calm and quiet place. One has to walk or cycle to reach here.well maintained.
Singapore Quarry,5,Very place for photographer... 🏞️

Singapore Quarry,5,A well maintained Nature Park. Really relaxing.
Singapore Quarry,5,Beautiful place to watch the clif and waters. Do be careful of monkeys though.
Singapore Quarry,5,Fantastic view. Worth the trek. Good resting point. Very tranquil too.
Singapore Quarry,5,"Was heading to the Hindhede Nature Park but end up here. Wrong turn was worth it. The view was mesmerising, water was calm with some large koi. Make sure to drop by when trekking Bukit Timah."
Singapore Quarry,5,Very short hike where you can see monkeys and other wildlife. Beautiful quarry
Singapore Quarry,4,The Singapore Quarry is a scenic spot where you can see a panoramic view of the quarry at the end of the trail. Roads are well maintained so it is an easy trek from the entrance. Easy hike and worth a view to see it at least once!
Singapore Quarry,4,Early morning place to go - with restrictions it opens at 8 am

Singapore Quarry,1,"I don't like, too many humans on weekend.😬👎"
Singapore Quarry,5,"Went for a excursion with 679, my big head 老大 lead the way. Along the way there are many slopes, uphills and downhill just like my life. However we only speak of the 重点， which is we need to train for the sports exam. So we chiong to the end, there is some water in the old quarry."
Singapore Quarry,3,This includes one of the trail in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Nice view.

Singapore Quarry,5,"When you have nothing else to do, I recommend coming here. Even though the road and the trail seems very empty and scary near night, after you have gone out of the 0.7km road to the Quarry, it is just a breeze going past you. A very nice place if you happen to get a great weather."
Singapore Quarry,5,It's very nice view. You have to walk or jog or cycle to reach this beautiful place.
Singapore Quarry,5,I was surprised to see this in Singapore after i did the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve hiking trail. Such a relaxing and picturesque place.
Singapore Quarry,5,"Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
It's a 1.4km healthy hike thereabouts, from either Dairy Farm car park A, or a little further for car park B. Nice gentle slopes, broad tarred roads lead from car park A along tree lined tropical jungle on either side. The quarry is beautifully serene and pleasing to the eye. Zen spot."
Singapore Quarry,5,Good view of the quarry from the shelter. A good place for rest and enjoying the tranquil scenery before continuing your trek.
Singapore Quarry,5,"If you enjoy a good run, start from the Dairy Farm road and follow the hilly and windy road that leads to the quarry.. Good for hill workout."
Singapore Quarry,5,Calming and quiet views! The quarry itself has a gate and opens from 7am-7pm
Singapore Quarry,5,Great place for a short hike. 🙃
Singapore Quarry,4,Fantastic view. I didn't know that S'pore has such beautiful scenery.
Singapore Quarry,5,"Walked this route on a February afternoon. It was breezy and cool under the trees. The quarry has been restored into a beautiful lake. A great little walk/jogging path, especially if you live nearby. The path is mostly a well maintained bitumen road."
Singapore Quarry,5,"Can't believe Singapore have such a place as this. Awesome beautiful, quiet and serene."
Singapore Quarry,5,Amazing view & very tranquil place to unwind & de-stress

You can start from Carpark A or from Asas entrance (there is a playground next to it). Pedestrians are not allowed on the mountain bike trail.

Интересное место. К карьеру ведет широкая асфальтированная  дорога, только небольшой участок без покрытия. Очень легкий доступ. Ступенек нет. Начать можно от Carpark A или от Asas entrance(около него есть детская площадка). По mountain bike trail проход пешеходам запрещен."

The caliber of sport is quite high and SCC competes in various sporting activities. Many members also play for various national teams."
Singapore Cricket Club,3,The day is hot and club is great. The decorations there is old and run down. The staff service level varies. Some really good but some is terrible. It's a nice place to spend some quality time with friends.

This is what it's all about three days of fun filled concerts and stuff. The ground does hold some significant here. The padang is where Japan surrendered after the war. We formed federation here and of course independence was celebrated here. So to all foreigners who come here and trash the place remember this is sacred ground. Thread lightly."
Singapore Cricket Club,5,"Excellent Sunday set lunch at Padang. Efficient service,  great food quality,  awesome ambiance. Well done 👏"
Singapore Cricket Club,5,Looking for place or club with aesthetics? This is the right place for it. They also have good food and some sport events.
Singapore Cricket Club,1,"The service of SCC (youth football department) is aweful. They don’t answer the phone calls nor reply to missed calls, and have poor response for emails too. Terrible service. Seems they have plenty of students so don’t care about potential new ones who sent in inquiries. Very disappointed service."

Singapore Cricket Club,4,"Great place for a social event. Good restaurants, reasonably priced food & drinks for members."
Singapore Cricket Club,4,"Excellent Club right in the heart of Singapore ! Boy the location is unmatched.  The Singapore Cricket club does have various sports - Cricket, Tennis etc., and restaurants, Bars etc., The ambience of the place is amazing ! and the view from the outside balcony is amazing.

Singapore Cricket Club,5,Relaxed atmosphere . Superb mulligatawny siup

Singapore Cricket Club,5,"very high class, High Level place for members mostly senior members of the community of Singapore."
Singapore Cricket Club,5,Beautiful place in the heart of the city. Lovely food.
Singapore Cricket Club,4,"Very beautiful club. Like the colonial look that it has. If you are big fan of cricket and have the money, this club has the best pitch in Singapore and also maybe the best field which i have always seen it as green unlike others. Members are friendly and have a different culture which is more western. Nice place to dine with family or a jug of beer with freinds on the open roof area."
Singapore Cricket Club,5,"i had the amazing opportunity to be here when i was invited by one of my close friends... the atmosphere is so peaceful and happy, with all the guests relaxed as well.  it has got a view of the National Gallery Singapore and the bay even from a distance. Their Chili Crab, is a must-try."

Singapore Cricket Club,5,We went with a friend. Exceptional service as always - the menu is huge. We ate the Chinese food. Good choice for Vegetarians.
Singapore Cricket Club,5,"Nice historic club that's right by Padang Field. It is a nice recreational club, but a little small compared to its peer across the field. This can be said to be more outdoor (tennis, cricket of course, rugby, etc), while the other one is more indoors (swimming, bowling, etc). The Indian restaurant and function space upstairs is pretty good, and service is really pleasant, especially if you're hosting a get together for wedding receptions or birthday parties."
Singapore Cricket Club,4,"Good food, good ambience, old world charm"
Singapore Cricket Club,5,"An old historic recreational club in the heart of the city, and very much a pleasant experience to hang out and spend some time with friends over activities that everyone can do together.

Singapore Cricket Club,1,"The SCC has extremely rude reception answering calls, as well as poor response from staff on reservations. No courtesy to provide any response on problem feedback on the rudeness of the reception during registration, poor staff response on the reservation, as well as the remark made by the reception during registration that they were making the process of registration difficult for these overseas members at the SCC, in response to their claim that the reciprocal club overseas was doing the same to their members. The staff member did not even accord the basic courtesy due to a Visiting Reciprocal Member."

The Indian section of the menus has a few vegan friendly options, I had the Mock Mutton comes in sauce, rice, pickled veggies and papadam. Superb!"
Singapore Cricket Club,4,Nice restaurant beside

Singapore Cricket Club,1,Colonial style with a colonial mentality. Discrimination is well and alive. Domestic helpers live with the family and at the very least deserves a seat at the table for dinner. All that money didn't bring you guys class.

Highly recommended and a definite must-try for all ages.
Bubble Bump Singapore,5,"Had a wonderful experience with Bubble Bump Singapore. The facilitators were very friendly yet professional in ensuring that we have a safe session. They also introduced several games we could play using the bubbles so we could get the full bubble bump experience. We had no problem wearing the bubble suit as the equipment they provided were clean and odorless.
Overall it was a very pleasant experience for me and my friends and I am sure we will use their services again!"

Bubble Bump Singapore,5,"Thanks for the bubble bump games at Kovan. Because of the rainy season this month, it was great that the venue was sheltered so that our session could still run despite heavy downpour. Overall, our group had a fun time bumping around in the bubble suits. Its great that the facilitators disinfected every bubble after each game to ensure it smelled fresh and clean."

Bubble Bump Singapore,5,"BUBBLE SOCCER is so fun! We played it at The Cage @ Kallang and all my friends had fun! It's funny to see everyone bumping around. The facilitators were really friendly too! Though we had the adult bubble suits, the facilitators rolled my younger cousins around in the bubble suits during the break time. Love it!"

Bubble Bump Singapore,5,
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Went here in the evening for star gazing session. Outside may look closed due to no light but it's actually open. Book session and tickets from website, slots limited. Theatre is free seating so come early if want to seat together, beat seats are at the middle, center of the theater near the aisle around row F. Great experience for kids."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Amazing show! The Superdogs film itself is really heartwarming but the real wow factor is the dome shaped screen that immerses you in the film. Beware, if you suffer from motion sickness easily you may find some parts uneasy but otherwise it's an incredible cinema experience and would definitely recommend"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Wonderful experience... Love to watch again
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,It is an immersive 45 mins of theater experience!
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Always a treat to be here except today we had to wait outside the glass door until the last min when I called a phone number so that someone wld let us in. Asked one of the staff before that and she just said to wait. Staff shd be more initiated and service oriented rather than giving convenient replies like just wait. We got in when the show was almost going to start after waiting 5 mins unnecessarily. Still I like omni max (:
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,The view is fantastic. We are stars story is also good.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"The super heroes dog is ok , after a while it was bored"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,OK. All included in the Sci Centre package. Limited time for Sci centre due to Covid. Only AM or PM 3 hour time slot
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,2,"The sphere looking screen was really cool but I didn’t like the content of the show “We are stars”. It’s basically the Evolution theory including the Big Bang theory. I didn’t think it was kids friendly, definitely not for toddlers."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,very clean place and comfortable seats!
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Nice indoor playgrou do for kids
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,I enjoyed the show 'We are stars''. It made chemistry look so interesting and fun.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Good experience,  would highly recommend for one time visit"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Very well mentioned theatre for a fully immersive theater experience. Definitely more immersive than 3D movies but doesn’t have the 4D element.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Love the Superpower dogs film.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Great show of the northern bear
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,3,"Great for kids to experience. From a technical perspective it falls short in several departments. To start with, the screen, although big and amazing, fails to impress. The colors are severely subdued and there is a lack of crisp and sharp video display. It almost feels like a 720p input bring up scaled to play on a 4k display panel. Secondly, the sound is lacking the surround feel to it and the treble is poorly adjusted, meaning the voice lacks that real life feel and volume to it. The seating is fine although more inclination would certainly help.

Having said all that, my 4 year old son was simply awestruck by it. If you have kids who have never experienced such screen before, definitely bring them!"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Went for a day trip to the science center. Loved the omni theatre, it still as amazing as the first time I saw it when I was young.

The experience was magnificent. Would have preferred better sound system thou"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Immersive experience. Slightly pricey tickets.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Show time is short around 30Mins.
However, the 3D dome show really creates an impact to the young Mind and spur their interest in science.
Experience this, no regrets.
Especially for junior school kids.
A boring session of atoms and molecules comes to life and it's no longer boring."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Can see great 3D or 4D movie over a 180 spherical screen
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Love the documentaries. Easy and clear. Wish it could have been longer...
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Interesting live show 'What's up there - Christmas edition'. The host was knowledgeable in astronomy and able to give fascinating facts about the universe...satellites,  nebulae, constellations, etc. You may take photographs or video without flash. The cafe was not open when i was there. Inconvenient for the kids. McDonald's was a few minutes walk at the Science Centre main building entrance."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"I was blown away by the great screen, as well as the movie itself (We are Stars), which is scientifically advanced, accurate yet easy to understand even for kids."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"It’s an expensive huge place like a packed entertainment, when ever I do visit with my folks I feel the excitement on everyone face , I do enjoy when I here but Visited the Omni Theatre to watch Space Next. I wasn't really impressed by it. It was like if I was watching a documentary of National Geographic in 730p , my bed room speaking box was more sharper than he screen .... an be improved"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"This is a really cool theater in the Singapore Science Centre. The screen is basically a dome that covers much of your viewing range. And they do interesting science-related movies. I would recommend it for kids. One caveat, littler ones might be scared of it due to sensory overload."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Nice theatre but front seats with recliner would be better dun take the front row go for the back rows
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Fantastic experience..clean seats, hassle-free purchase of tix and great documentary!"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,FOR ALL AGE. I LOVED THE EXPERIENCE
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"The wonderful view is why you should come here.  Comfortable seating and satisfactory sound, images are acceptable too.  The shows go on a cycle and change is slow.  So having watched 4 of the shows in a day, it wold be almost 6 months to a year before I head back.  Narration is sometimes handled by the staff who's articulation can be enhanced for comprehension.  Not the most friendly of service crew, some don't open their mouths and use the proverbial ""eye power"" to help you.  Was a 5 in my eyes many years ago, it is a 4 today, and most likely, a 3 or even lower.  Service standards here have dropped a great deal.  I think it has to do with a lower visitation rate as well and thus a slippery slope.  Poor service means less visitors, thus resulting in even poorer serve as it is no longer a priority location.  Used to visit every 3 months, now every 12 to 18 months."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Best Movie Theatre Ever. One of the best experiences I ever had.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,2,Visited the Omni Theatre to watch Space Next. I wasn't really impressed by it. It was like if I was watching a documentary of National Geographic in 730p. My tv at home is sharper. Definitely not worth it given the price. Better watch a good movie in the cinema for that money.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Best omni theater experience I had. Huge 180 degree display feel like we are inside the movie. Landing on moon gives heart pounding experience in Back to the Moon for good movie. Be there. Unforgettable experience.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Went to watch the aurora lights show. Don't expect to be super wowed as part of the show also scientifically explained why and how aurora lights are formed. After that explored the various installations at science ctr.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"It's a really cool experience, and although the shows aren't the best, it really show cases the immersive aspect of the sphere screen"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Lovely dome theatre for watching 3D movie.  Catch the Aurora show recently.  It was magnificent.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,1,Show WE ARE STARS - Money not worth it. Not to recommend.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,The experience of dome theatre and huge screen is awesome.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Really nice the movie are the best I saw the bear movie
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Excellent place to view OMNIMax theatre
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Omni theatere is one of a kind 180 degrees theatere. You can watch the movies not only directly but all.over your hesd as if you are sitting and the sky dome.

The experience is very thrilling and interesting equally for kids and grown up kids of all ages.

Would recommend it to anyone"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Omni theatre is a must visit when you are in Singapore Science Centre. The ""surround"" screen offers viewers an immersive experience, there's nothing like this elsewhere in Singapore. There are 2 titles showing each day, every hour. Tickets are currently priced at SGD 14 for adults and children alike. Hop over to Snow City while you're here to make for an incredible experience, especially for kids."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,It was a great opportunity to gaze the sky totally for free of charge
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Omni theatre was good. The polar bear rainforest show was little boring after a while
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,The show was about The Northern Light or Aurora. Cool presentation
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Was the best experience I ever had in a theatre. I enjoyed myself very much and I hope I could go again and you should yoo!
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Nice imax shows available. However, the theater hasn't been upgraded in a while"
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"It was amazing! The theatre was rather large, and it felt like we were in the movie. I recommend this place if you want to come to the Singapore Science Centre with your family."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Quite a unique experience here watching the spectacular polar light...
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Totally submerged into my free thinking of knowing what this Theatre is all about...Just explore and let your dreams come true
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,A great for scientific moive in Singapore. Should not miss it. At least once in a life time.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,I slept well thanks to the comfortable chair
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Enjoyed the night sky viewing in the omni theatre observatory. So happy to see the rings of the Saturn, craters on the moon n belts in Jupiter."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Omni Theatre is one of the largest 360 movie theatre in Singapore. You can pick one of the Discovery movie, but my favourite is Northen Lights. The best position is near the middle projector, which is seat number JL6/JR7. No seating arrangement will be made. You can choose your seat after get in. The gate will be open 10 minutes before show, just be at the first que to get this best seat."
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Excellent experience of watching Aurora. Feels like you are there
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Love the omni theatre experience, more than 180 degree view of the documentary. Immersive feel. Would never have come on my own though, too out of place."

Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,"Nice omni theatre, excellent seating. Show was low definition letdown"

Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Watch magnificent documentary there only in sg
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,4,Very informativè. But has a dizzying effect for some people (me!).

Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Awesome Guys. Must visit place.
Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,"Great fun show for kids, impressive show"

Omni-Theatre by Science Centre Singapore,5,Great expertise for young ones...

Kusu Island,5,Views are nice ! Quiet and clean
Kusu Island,4,Nice place to swim. Small island. They seem to be building a food court which might make this place less peaceful.
Kusu Island,5,"Second time here after many many years.
Not much changes to the island.
But there seems to be a lot of construction ongoing on the island. The datok shrine is under maintenance and people are not allowed to climb up the hills...chinese temple is still open though.

The ferry system in kusu is slightly better than on St John. Not as chaotic when queuing up for your ferry ride."
Kusu Island,5,Kusu island is a nice place to visit and relax beside the beach. There are temples and Kramat.
Kusu Island,5,"Yesterday we took a nature walk on Kusu Island. Plenty of nature to see and no monkeys to make a nuisance of themselves...
The centrepiece of the Island is the Da Bong Gong Temple. But around this from both ends of the island there is an abundance of nature. I saw a pair of Brahminy kites, several collared kingfishers from which I was able to locate one of their nests, Pacific swallows, Javan mynas, Eurasian sparrows, Oriental (or paddy field) pipits and an Oriental magpie robin.

Plenty of tortoises. Interesting long legged flies - bright metallic green.

The Keramat Kusu Temple is presently closed due to a landslide in January.

There is a turtle monument in the centre of the island."
Kusu Island,5,Lovely little island near to st john island
Kusu Island,4,"Not that of a big island but still okay. There is a temple located on this island as well.
If you are thinking about going to St. Johns Island and Kusu Island as well and don't have enough time, then go to St. Johns island only because that is very very huge which includes Lazarus island as well. You can find some cute turtles on the island as well.

I went to Kusu Island first and then to St. Johns Island but then regretted my decision. St. Johns island needs a complete day."
Kusu Island,3,I suppose most visitors will visit during the Chinese lunar month of September for festival prayer and food court will be open then. Other time will be a good and peaceful relaxation. Or die hard ninja turtle fans who like to visit their counterpart...
Kusu Island,5,"Fun place to go for exploration, walk along the beach & wave breakers. Good place for fishing & picnic too."
Kusu Island,5,Worthwhile a visit for a picninc or small leisure stroll. Small island with a defined ocean breeze which is refreshing!
Kusu Island,5,Exploring the Island... Pray Pray... Wind on your face... relaxing by the beach... Watching the wave run up to the naughty sands...
Kusu Island,4,"Pretty small island with nothing much to explore. There is a toilet. Can bring your own snacks to picnic by the benches. No shelter so if it rains you gotta run to the jetty or the Chinese temple.

There used to be food stalls."
Kusu Island,5,Refreshing place with no frills - no WiFi no food nothing! Entirely different perspective and beautiful scenery of the CBD from an outside view
Kusu Island,5,It's a small island but a tranquil and serene one. I visited on a weekday and it was so nice to eat picnic food overlooking the CBD in the background. There is a small tortoise sanctuary too.
Kusu Island,3,"Untouched nature, in need of a revamp for some attractions though.."
Kusu Island,5,"Go and have a fun day outing here. It’s small but a great place to go and hang out with your friends or family alike. (There is no direct boat, it goes first to Lazarus and then drops you at Kusu).

There’s even a temple and tortoise sanctuary located here.

There are barbecue spots and small huts for resting and eating (so don’t forget to carry some snacks and drinks).

Towards the back part, there is a huge open area great for kite flying. We had taken a 🪁 and tested it out there."
Kusu Island,3,"A tiny island in close proximity to St John's island. This is really a tiny island. The only good thing here is the lagoon which quite shallow and safe.
So called turtle sanctuary is 4x4 feet enclosure with few inch deep water. There used to be some food options here but not any more. Food stalls infra is built but none of the stall is occupied and serving.
Fortunately someone decided to sell cold drinks and water inside the Chinese temple which comes as a nig saviour for thirsty visitors.
Keramat Kusu shrine is closed.
Another good thing at the island is Cabanas which provide a good spot for family picnics.
Overall this place is just OK"
Kusu Island,5,Good place to chill
Kusu Island,5,A nice place to visit with friends and family for relaxation. I enjoyed a lot with my friends and family. The place was clean and so beautiful. The sound of the waves were so nice. Kusu Island is also known as Tortoise Island
Kusu Island,4,It is a good place that is relaxing in Singapore Island.
Kusu Island,5,"Nice & peaceful. A good get-away for a sat or sun morning trip. There are Chinese food stalls (Non-halal) setup during the Kusu island annual pilgrimage (typically end of Sep till end of Oct).

It would be wise to bring your own drinks/food if you are visiting outside this period.

Google for ""kusu island annual pilgrimage"" to check the dates."
Kusu Island,5,St johns island has more natutal sites. Kusu island is more cultural. Interesting stories about chinese temple and malay shrine
Kusu Island,4,"Very scenic and sanctuary island with a few temples located on it. As the name suggests, the island is home to the many tortoises where visitors can feed and observe their living habitat. However, the island doesn't sell food, only a very limited variety of beverages which are sold by the Chinese temple, which may cause a certain hassle to some of the people."
Kusu Island,5,"A very pretty and beautiful island; Kusu means ""Tortoise"" or ""Turtle"" in Chinese; so there are lots of turtles to see in their enclosed santuary. Plus the Chinese Temple is impressive."
Kusu Island,4,"visited this place yesterday and found the place to be clean and quite well maintained. there's actually nothing much to do there, just sceneries and sightseeing.

we went to the Chinese temple with a wishing well and holy shrines of Malay saints after climbing 152 steps. be careful on your way up to the shrines as the monkeys around might snatch your belongings.

if you are lucky, you might be able to see a cute ""caretaker"", a corgi known as Ginger. the dog belongs to the caretaker and her daughter. they are very friendly and nice people. we played with their dog while waiting for our ferry.

it's a relaxed place to get away from the city if you have not visited the island. do remember to fill up your stomach before you go to the island or bring your own food and water as there is no food or drinks stall there."
Kusu Island,5,"I joined a morning trip to this island in ""the intertidal walk"" program of NUS natural museum. It is so beautiful to see sea creatures and joined coast cleaning program;) During low tidal time you can see many colorful and wonderful creatures, and of course sun rise on the beach! You can enjoy picnic and organize team building here as well!"
Kusu Island,4,Small idyllic island off the southern coast of Singapore. There's a huge brightly coloured Chinese temple near the jetty and a uniquely Singaporean multicultural Malay shrine on the top of the hill. Plan to spend half a day here. Ferry service from marina south pier.
Kusu Island,5,Nice place this kusu island.this place my first visited island. I was so excited surrounded fully water center land . This place so many trees very cool and peaceful with wild animals background music . Very relaxing place . Bring ur food and drinks water .. this place no more sell any food and waters . Who like swim this place very nice for urs. Swimming only after 4 pm .bcz evening time only sea water level high.  If you want swim morning or afternoon .u must go  Lazarus beach
Kusu Island,4,"Peaceful small island away from Singapore, very quiet and small island, there is Chinese temple and Few tortoise, nothing much attractive."
Kusu Island,3,Very mini Island with interesting  temples and beautiful beach.
Kusu Island,4,"Great for getting out of the city for bit of quiet. A couple of famous temples but not much else. There's the big dua pek Kong temple and a smaller one up the hill. Watch out for the monkeys on the hill. Generally, the island is very clean. The ferry is quite punctual, so try to keep to the ferry timing. May get crowded during the pilgrimage period."
Kusu Island,5,Beautiful island ... Beautiful Temple .... 🙏
Kusu Island,5,"Very beautiful place for picnic,and fun for exploration. It is also called turtle island."
Kusu Island,3,"The Island is very small so there is only that much to see, there are not many shelters so it’s quite hot and also would be troublesome when raining. But it’s a good place to chill and relax as the beach is nice.

There is also a tortoise shelter which you can look at the tortoise enclosure, they are very cute."
Kusu Island,4,Relaxing place. ❤️
Kusu Island,4,"It's a nice peaceful place for a one day picnic, where you can have a day with nature with food and friends:)"
Kusu Island,5,"Lovely spot for chilling, walking out along the rock bunds. Can see the singapore skyline from Kusu!"
Kusu Island,4,Best southern islands of Singapore. Have 3 islands together and another island called kusu nearby to these islands.
Kusu Island,5,"Quiet place. Enjoy the wind , pray to datuk gong."
Kusu Island,5,All Singaporeans should visit this island at least once in the lifetime.
Kusu Island,4,"Unexpected in Singapore
Try to be on weekdays ... You feel so calm"
Kusu Island,4,"If you're in Singapore and looking for a short escape to another island without needing your passport, Kusu Island can be a destination to be considered. It's just south of Singapore where you take a boat from Marina South Pier.

There are two temples on the island that you can visit, one on a hill and one near the jetty, but they're relatively small and no larger than an average MRT station. The main attraction on this island is mainly the ocean view, where you can take loads of insta worthy shots.

No shops on this island as well, so make sure you pack your own food and drinks before heading to this island. It's an ideal place for a picnic, though."
Kusu Island,5,"Kusu Island has more to offer than just the 3 Kusu Keramats and Chinese temple. It offers a fantastic location to have a picnic, sunbath and simply chill out with family and friends!"
Kusu Island,5,Small serene beach away from the madness of busy Singapore streets.
Kusu Island,5,It’s a nice place...
Kusu Island,5,Beautiful and relax place
Kusu Island,5,"It's exquisite and finest.

i've been there for the first time when i was a teen. who did made a trouble."
Kusu Island,4,Ok
Kusu Island,5,Best place I’ve ever been during my Singapore days. Cosy boat and best place ever to unwind with family or friends outing there’s a historic places to go too had to write whatever you wish for your life and many people believed it that once you do that all your dreams will come true.
Kusu Island,4,"Beautiful island with lots of shelters and benches, equipped with toilet and shower facility. You can get a nice view of Singapore central district from the beach. Seems like they are constructing a food center on the island too."
Kusu Island,5,"Excellent for Family trips! This is a must-see for tourists and locals alike.
One of the best ways to get a break from the Metropolis SG to the Natural Wild SG."
Kusu Island,5,"Island very Interesting, if it is cloudy, few shelters, can be a picnic spot, with a ship ride takes to the island, it's better if 2 or more families together go, with items to play like Frisbee, ball games. Bring along food items according to your tastes.. And a mat... Best to enjoy the outing."
Kusu Island,5,Peaceful little island away from the stress and hustles of normal city life in Singapore. The sea water was quite clear and several marine fishes are spotted around the jetty. There is hawker food during the busy few weeks of pilgrimage around October but there is likely minimal or no food vendors during the off peak periods. Bring your own food for a small picnic trip.
Kusu Island,5,"Loved it so peaceful, and plenty of Birds & Wildlife including Monkeys (3)"
Kusu Island,5,Very calm island. Good for photography. Can get good view of MBS and Singapore Kris Flyer from this island.
Kusu Island,5,Hot! But the dark after subset was great!
Kusu Island,5,I visited this place there have fresh air beautiful view
Kusu Island,4,Nice place. Need to carry food. No eateries available at island
Kusu Island,5,"Family enjoyed the trip very much.

Just 30mins ferry ride from marine south pier to Kusu Island.

Sea water is clear, can see fishes swimming underneath the ferry.

We pay respect to the famous 大伯公庙 & Datok Gong temple on the hill top. 🙏"
Kusu Island,5,"not too crowded, nice place to relax and have some temple!"
Kusu Island,5,"Less than 30 minutes from marina south piers by boat. If i dont false, there will be a lot of singaporean visit this island around july or september; To pray on the chinese temple. U can check the complete information from google. Bring foods & drink along with you but Be careful with 3 wild monkeys that live there. Don't run when they started to approach u. Just hide ur food & slowly slide away. U can also find turtles sanctuary in this island. Also remember your boat schedule, dont miss the return boat time."
Kusu Island,4,Nice relaxing beach with cabanas. Not very crowded sometimes you can have the whole beach just for yourself. You need to ride the ferry from Marina South Pier. Ticket cost around $16 (2-way). Important note: BRING FOOD AND WATER :)
Kusu Island,4,Peaceful and quiet awesome picnic spot
Kusu Island,5,Beautiful scenery and green environment .!
Kusu Island,5,"A natural greener serene island not too far from bustling Singapore and just a reasonable SG$18 per adult to & from boat ride away, while also giving interested visitors option to hop off on St John Island and again hop on for Kusu Island when next boat comes for ride. Plenty to walk around and explore. Bring ample quantity food and water as the island is very devoid of any eatery, completely opposite to Singapore island - but a good decision choice. Boats are basic with seating facility for open air ride as well as in air-conditioned chambers and a small toilet on board. No overnighting on Kusu also. Good for families no doubt."
Kusu Island,5,Nice place to have fun with gf 😉
Kusu Island,4,"Kusu island located at the southern side of sg island not very big attraction lagoon there a chinese temple and muslim natok kong mostly worshipper will visit for praying purpose ,I should this island is also  a historic place in the 18 century mostly chinese immigrant from china coming to singapura some make stop at here ,because

Kusu Island,5,"(Translated by Google) Wherever you go, in Singapore, where you can relax and play with kids, adults can have a picnic with a beer in one of the rich natural places. A small island less than 1 km (perhaps). You can feel like you are a self-made resort on Kus Island than going to a distant Resort Island. As there are many turtles, children are overjoyed there too. At low tide you can play with crabs, starfish and shellfish, and since the water is clearer than the mainland you can swim and play at high tide. If you are with a child, it is recommended to go at low tide! Please take a scoop and a bucket. There are no shops or vending machines on the island, so plenty of drinks and food are essential. After that, it is better to have some rain gear in preparation for sudden thunderstorms.

There are also thousands of Chinese people, and there is no one on the neighboring island of St John. If you could rent kayaks here and clean the beaches on an ongoing basis, it would be a mega paradise ... It's a pity, because the potential of these islands is very large.

Lazarus Island,5,"Beautiful beach. Very rare to see clear blue sea in Singapore!

Didn't managed to stay for long though, as  the ferry timings are very tight. Only managed to walk 1 round around the island and that's it.

No food/drink stalls on the island. Have to pack your own lunch!"
Lazarus Island,4,Make sure you check where the toilets are located on your way in and bring a bag to hold your trash while at the beach. Lets keep this place pristine.

They don't sell anything on this island, so it's better to be get prepared, food, drinks, picnic mat and etc. Overall nice place to chill and get sun tan If you enjoy outdoor, swimming.

This beach is a nice place to take a sun bath as well good for a leisurely swim, owing to its very still waters. This beach being not connected to the main land singapore enjoys less crowd providing privacy and calm."

Lazarus Island,5,Beautiful little island off St John’s island. Saw a toilet sign but didn’t get to see it.
Lazarus Island,5,"Lazarus Island offers 2 beaches and is by far the superior place to be. Do note the smaller initial beach that you see whilst crossing the bridge from St John. This smaller beach can be pretty dangerous due to the strong currents from the breakwater the funnels water towards Kusu Island. The beach at the back offers a long and pretty much pristine beach that once can enjoy with family and friends.

Do note that there are no public toilets in the area."
Lazarus Island,5,"The best and private place to get away from the city crowd. Very clean with lushy green forest and turquoise water.
How to get there:  get a ferry to St. John from Marina south pier and once off at the st john pier, take a left and walk for about 10 minutes+. You'll meet a lot of cats on the way. Then just follow the sign board. Bring your  swimsuit and most important food, water and sunscreen. Bringing an umbrella is a must as the weather is very unpredictable. On returning, make sure not to miss the last ferry. You might get stranded on the island, though there is a emergency contact number of the ferry/s at the entrance of the pier. Do have a look and take a snapshot. Also keep the island clean carry the litters in plastic bag and throw it in  a bin."
Lazarus Island,5,Beautiful nature. Fresh air.
Lazarus Island,5,"You can take a public boat from Singapour habour to get here. When you board, you think you travveld back in time - very basic. The island is nice to get away from the city and relax"
Lazarus Island,4,"Easily accessible via a link from St John's island. There are no toilets, trash bins or amenities on this island so bring ample plastic bags, food and beverages. If you want a nice quiet beach in Singapore this is the best you can get."
Lazarus Island,5,Hidden gem in Singapore. Nice beaches and scenery. A return ticket costs $18 per person. Walk from St John Island.
Lazarus Island,5,"Wonderful desert beach. White sand, transparent water. Ideal for a day trip. Do take food and water as the island is free from bar hotel ans restaurant. A natural place"
Lazarus Island,5,One of the most serene gateways near Singapore :)
Lazarus Island,4,Good get away but no amenities
Lazarus Island,4,Relax place
Lazarus Island,4,Lush green and blue water gives lovely feeling about this beach... sunny day lovely colorful beach. Perfect beach to play.....
Lazarus Island,5,"I might sound weird, but I suggest to visit the island during rain..it's magical."
Lazarus Island,5,Very nice and clean water with beaches. Totally different experience from mainland Singapore. Must come if you're bored.
Lazarus Island,5,Wonderful place for weekend outing
Lazarus Island,5,"We visited Lazarus Island on one Sunday. It has one of the best beaches in Singapore. It is also known as Pulau Sakijang Pelepah, is one of the Southern Islands in Singapore. If you intend to stay there the whole day, make sure you have enough supplies. Do remember to bring everything back. Cheers."
Lazarus Island,3,"Great beach but social distancing not well followed here, there were quite a few groups of over 5 people, and people were not wearing their masks on the ferry while inside the cabin."
Lazarus Island,5,"Enjoy the nothingness here.  Bring a Frisbee,  beach ball,  swimming board,  float,  sunblock,  shades and you are all good.    Have some insect repellent with you will help. Do bring enough trash bag to use,  let's help to keep the place as clean and comfortable :)
Cater enough time to make your way back to the ferry.  If you are behind time,  prepared to run!  Claps and cheers on the ferry are more fun :D"
Lazarus Island,5,"Cannot begin to explain how shocked and impressed I am with this little island.

You have to go to Marina South Pier to catch a 30min ferry ride to St John Island. It is $18 SGD round trip- it also stops at another small island at the end. Pay close attention to the ferry schedule.

Once you get to St John Island you walk a 30 min walk to get to Lazarus island and finally the Lagoon where you can layout and hang out at the beach. There are NO chairs/umbrellas/towels/anything at all on the beach. You must bring everything with you. There's nothing on these islands to purchase.

The water wasn't cold. It's crystal clear!! At a distant you can see the ships with shipping containers but wasn't a deal-breaker for me. After you're done, the only shower facility I found was by back where the ferry dropped you off.

Once you catch the ferry to head back it stops on Kusu Island for an hr. And then back to main island Singapore.

Very well worth a visit to get away from the bustling city life."
Lazarus Island,5,A great escape from bustling Singapore. Bring what you need and bring it back. Water looks nice. A relaxing time overall
Lazarus Island,5,Just a few minutes walk from St. Johns Island. Scenic view with a pretty looong beach. Water is not that clear during my visit but its fine for swimming and frisbee/volleyball.
Lazarus Island,5,"The best beach in Singapore... Nice, clean sandy beach with clear water. Some trees for shading. Toilets a bit far. Kids had a fun"
Lazarus Island,5,"St John's Island and Lazarus Island

I have been to Lazarus Island once before and it wasn't amazing. But last we went there again Sunday and after a rainy morning the we had a sunny afternoon and I realized why this beach is considered the most beautiful in Singapore: fine sand and transparent turquoise water.
We spent a great day there:
- ""visit"" of St John's Island, it's fast, not much to do - see photo of the map of the island
- picnic, and with the many tables available to people it was almost a luxury picnic.
- Walk to Lazarus Island - 20 minutes
- Beach
- Hermit crab's breeding - the water was so transparent that you could see them on the sand and they are easily caught - it kept the children busy for 2 hours 😉

How to get there:
- Ferry - departure Marina South Pier (cab or MRT next door) - 14 SGD per person - see schedule in pictures - attention there are several ferry lines that go there
- Rent a private boat - several hundred dollars

Be aware:
- You must be ready for anything: rain and extreme heat.
- You have to bring everything, no food or drinks on site.
- There are potentially jelly fish, but not seen a single one in the afternoon
- Don't miss the last ferry (left at 6pm with our company)
- 4g is available there! Block your connection if you don't want your children to spend their aprem on the phone!

Good news, there are several toilets on the island, and several shelters in case of rain!

We saw a lot of diving boat that must be nice to do there too.

It was a superb day in spite of the rain of the morning. The children also loved the boat trip which lasts only 20 minutes. We had the chance to leave by ferry and to come back with a small boat limited to 12 persons and much faster."
Lazarus Island,5,Easily accessible via ferry from Marina South Pier.
Lazarus Island,5,"Island barely has any crowd, the water is clean most of the times and you're most likely going to like it.

I would suggest anyone going there to keep waste bags with them, so that the island is kept clean :)"
Lazarus Island,5,"A scenic place for relaxation, shallow clean waters and white sand. Bring some food and drinks"
Lazarus Island,4,"Love the clear blue water. The beach is cleaner than the mainland thanks to an indian cleaner Uncle who sweep and clear the beach of rubbish and seaweed in the early morning. Avoid coming in the afternoon as the sea level goes down from Kusu, rubbish and seaweed will wash to shore..."
Lazarus Island,5,Beautiful and peaceful plase to rest and have a picnic :)
Lazarus Island,5,Beautiful scenery and nice beaches. Just a word of note is that Kusu Island is not worth staying over 2 hours so take note of the ferry times.
Lazarus Island,5,"Perfect place for campaigns and swimming.. fishing and outdoors activities for FAMILY, friends and everyone
."
Lazarus Island,5,A perfect short getaway from the hustle and bustle of the usual Singapore beaches. The island is clean and calm (so when you do visit remember not to leave any trace of you being there). And bring a mat and if needed bring an umbrella if the sun is too strong or if it rains as the shelters are minimal. The water is clean and clear and you can see fishes swimming happily :)
Lazarus Island,4,"The island is almost intact except that a private ferry pier, some log cabins and the walking lane going through it. There is a nice white-sand beach where people are able to bathe, play games or fly kites. Have to go back to St John if you want to fresh-water bathe after sea-bathe here."
Lazarus Island,5,Quiet and peacefull.. a monthly routine to go..
Lazarus Island,5,Awesome island .. do carry water food and must with the hidden lagoon
Lazarus Island,5,"really a different place from anywhere in Singapore, with few buildings. Easy and not expensive to reach by boat (18 $). Clean and green, with a beautiful beach. Be sure to have your food and water, plenty of, and check the timetables."
Lazarus Island,3,Still upgrading but a wonderful man made island!
Lazarus Island,4,Lovely Island just off Singapore
Lazarus Island,5,"The beach here is extremely clean and water is clear. A good place to hang out with friends or family. Little shelther on the island though, so people should remember to bring sunblock and/or unmbrellas."
Lazarus Island,4,"Nice, small island for exploring on foot.
Please note: the beach has a LOT of sandflies - wear repellent or risk painful and itchy bites.
As other reviewers have stated, there's no development here so you'll need to carry in all your supplies, but it's very pleasant and quite quiet. The main beach had quite a few families and groups enjoying it when I visited, but once you leave the beach area and explore further into the island, it gets very quiet indeed."
Lazarus Island,5,"Dun say never share.
Excellent place for couple to paktor, without getting caught :smirk:"
Lazarus Island,5,Good Place to get away from the hustle bustle of city life..Nice place..
Lazarus Island,5,Waters clean and a wonderful place to spend your free time

Lazarus Island,5,Good boating beach

Lazarus Island,5,Awesome
Lazarus Island,4,something different to Singapore
Lazarus Island,5,Crystal clear beach at South Singapore
Lazarus Island,3,"(Translated by Google) There are no vending machines and no shops on the island... There is only one toilet, and there are few pavilions. The entire island has only weeds and some trees. Except for the beach, there are only some plants that are attractive. There are only one or two cats. This island feels boring after staying for a long time... The worst thing is that there is no pier on this island. To take a boat back to Marina Bay, you have to walk a long way to the St. John’s Island Pier. On a hot day, you have to walk a long circle to reach the pier... Don’t say old age People...Young people can't stand it...If you want to come to this island, remember to bring water and sunscreen.

岛上没有自动贩卖机，也没有商店…厕所只有一个，凉亭又很少，整个岛就只有野草和一些树，除了沙滩之外就只有一些植物吸引人，猫咪就只有一，两只……在这岛呆久了觉得很无聊……最糟糕的是这个岛没有码头，要搭船回滨海湾要走到很远的圣约翰岛码头，大热天要走一大圈才到码头…不要说老年人…年轻人也受不了…要来这个岛记得要带水和防晒霜"

Lazarus Island,3,"(Translated by Google) We went to the island on 05/12/2018, at the moment there is a renovation, and there is only a place on the beach. No gazebos, toilets, sinks, cheap. It's more like a wild vacation, a picnic.
The sea is clean, warm and very salty. At the bottom of the sea it stepped into fuel oil, apparently from ships! I got two feet and a hand dirty, I ate like rubbed it on the grass. Be careful!

(Original)
Ездили на остров 12.05.2018 года,  в данный момент там идет ремонт, и есть только место на пляжу.  Нет беседок,  туалетов,  раковины,  дешевых.  Это больше похоже на дикий отдых,  пикник.
Море чистое, теплое, сильно соленое. На дне моря наступила в мазут,  видимо от кораблей!  Испачкала две ноги и руку,  Ели как оттерла об траву.  Будте аккуратнее!"
Lazarus Island,5,"(Translated by Google) We move on foot from pier. Nothing except the beach. By the way, the road near the back cove is not connected, so it is a dead end.

Lazarus Island,4,"(Translated by Google) Take a ferry to St. John's Island and walk from there. Because a ferry on weekdays is 2 flights a day, you need to be careful about the time.
There is no place selling food or drinks, so don't forget to bring it with you.
The beach is very calm and beautiful. As it is not crowded at all, it calms down.
I wanted to swim, but when I entered the sea, my body was hurting and could hardly enter. It might be Zoea, but there were also others swimming, and I was uncertain because I had no symptoms.
There are also a lot of sand flies.
I was bitten even though I was using insect repellent.
Because there are many mosquitoes, insect control is essential.

Changi Beach,5,"We drove all the way here and spent a lovely evening by the water. The place was relatively empty - though there were some people who were enjoying the view and having a picnic. The car park is located right next to the beach, which was quite convenient. We parked and walked about and enjoyed the scenery and the sunset. A memorable evening indeed. The sky became dark grey and we left before it started pouring."
Changi Beach,4,Low tides are one of the best at changi beach. When you are visiting do watch out your steps while walking on the beach bed. Also do not pick any marine life.
Changi Beach,5,"Amazing place.
Well connected by cycling track.
Superb place to enjoy sunset with family and friends.

Changi Beach,5,"Serene, calm, quite and beautiful.. Perfect place to spend your evening..."
Changi Beach,5,"One of the less crowded beaches in Singapore. Lovely place to soak in the water and watch the planes take off/land just above your head.

Can get crowded, so go early (before 10 am on weekends) to get a good spot under a shady tree."
Changi Beach,5,Best place for picturesque sunrise view. The take off and landing of planes also give a sense of excitement during this covid time when travel is not possible. A good park with all the basic amenities present. Do read up about the historical significance of this place as well.
Changi Beach,5,Nice places to have a walk and enjoy the sea breeze.
Changi Beach,5,"Long stretch of sand beach. Despite many people it’s relatively easy to find spot with safe distancing from others. Bring a deck chair and a drink, great way to relax and enjoy the sea view in the evening."
Changi Beach,5,Nice place to hangout with friends.
Changi Beach,5,"A relaxing park located at the far east of Singapore. Enjoy the scenary, village lifestyle by seeing the old fishing boat ferrying passenger..

Prominent statue of the Inscription of the island. Is good place for a picnic with family and kids. Must have a car to reach changi village and walking distance to park."

Changi Beach,5,"Out on a late weekday morning, along the peaceful stretch of Changi Beach Park. Not crowded, with a few families enjoying the beach.

Spotted a Hornbill in the tree, saw 2 otters swimming in the channel.. wow what a day!

Learnt the neighboring island was part of British defense outpost and the site of the changi beach massacre during the Japanese Occupation.. this place is rich in history, yet there is calmness.

Cross the pedestrian bridge to get to changi village and have your nasi lemak! Or to continue onto the coastal walk on the opposite bank. Have a chat with the fishermen on their catch. Just chill…"
Changi Beach,3,"Not so crowded in the weekdays,  nice and sunny."
Changi Beach,5,"Spring tide on the dawn of 26/6/21 drew me to visit the intertidal zone of Changi Beach which I have heard much about but have not personally witnessed. It was an eye opener for me to spot the rich diversity of marine animals nestled among the seagrass exposed within the brief window period of a low tide. One can only imagine an even richer diversity of marine life deeper into the sea. I was grateful to meet a man named Mr Kiew, who is a nature volunteer with NParks and provides educational information to the public on the marine creatures they have spotted. For me it was a fascinating experience when I tilted a sea shell to a side and out emerged the beautiful claws and legs of an orange striped hermit crab which then tried to return its borrowed home to an upright state. Nature’s creation is awesome, with every living creature having a purpose in their existence, and there’s so much to appreciate that all of us co-exists on the same planet."
Changi Beach,5,"A good, peaceful getaway.  Spent a nice day with family."
Changi Beach,5,"Best place for Walk, Run or bike riding for family. the park is awesome and evening visit is the best either nice breeze or watch flights landing/takeoffs"
Changi Beach,4,Nice place to hang out when the weather is nice. A good crowd was there engaged in various activities but not too crowded to feel like its cramped. Very relaxing. Theres a big hawker center right beside the park which is a plus if grabbing a bite is on the agenda.

There are a lot seagulls flying & gliding on the sky, flock of pigeons, nice large green field, palm trees, trees, a cafe in the park. You can see some boats & their activities at the jetty too. And it's pretty near Changi Village for those who love to explore some culiners"
Changi Beach,5,Nice place to chill after a meal at Changi Village. All amenities have been upgraded for the public to enjoy here.

Changi Beach,5,Lovely view
Changi Beach,5,"Come in the evening where the crowd sizzles out . You will find time almost stands still without the rumbling sound of the motor boats , just the waves hitting against the shores in a rhythmic  pattern calming your mind ."
Changi Beach,5,"Beautiful beach, great weather. Can see planes as well"
Changi Beach,5,"A family-friendly beach and park. One of the best beaches in SG as it looks cleaner than ECP and Pasir Ris Park beach and less ships in the horizon. The restaurant at the entrance — The Seagrill serves luscious food and drinks, the Cheval’s Singapore Sling cocktail is a must try!"

If need to get food, can walk over to Changi village across the bridge."
Changi Beach,5,Great place for relaxing. Lot of eatnary nearby. Well connected with public transport.

Changi point  jetty is near by, the scenary is much nicer than east coast with many boats around"

Changi Beach,5,"A nice and great cost area for walk, cycling and riding. Weather was just nice and there is a bicycle rental shop (including those bike with child seats) just beside carpark 1.

Changi Beach,5,"Changi Beach Park is a place I truly enjoy visiting. The sea breeze is absolutely windy and strong. The place is very clean as well. It's a great place for families and friends to come for outdoor activities.

You can bring along your own food, tables and chairs to have a picnic. Some of them also bought speakers to play their music while enjoying quality time with each other.

There are many empty spaces for people to play frisbee and ball games.

The sand it has allows children to build sand castles. Children can also rent bicycles, roller skates to play in the park. There is also playground for kids and adults to enjoy.

Couples also come here to take their wedding photos.

Some come here to swim in the sea.

There are also very good food in Changi Village which allows people to have a good meal after enjoying the meal.

Beside Changi Beach, there's also a ferry terminal where you can see ferry passing by. As it's also near Changi airport, you also get to see airplanes flying pass once in a while.

😞"
Changi Beach,5,Our favourite beach ever
Changi Beach,4,Nice place where I did some of my photoshoot. Best enjoyed during weekdays to prevent crowds.
Changi Beach,3,"I like it but there were a lot of rocks and
I just slide on top of one while i am boarding and"
Changi Beach,5,"I went there on a weekday, coincidentally, that day the wind was very strong. No crowd, good scenery and good food nearby."
Changi Beach,4,"The deep blue sky with shining stars seems extremely brilliant.
It looks like a huge chess board full of chess pieces.
Beautiful sky with picturesque constellation can be infectious, which makes people feel its splendor and tranquility.
Never expected to capture milky way at Changi beach, Singapore."
Changi Beach,4,A beautiful place to unwind. Rest relax and briskwalk enjoying the sea breeze and watch low flying aircraft. The food prices at the hawker centre is reasonable.

Changi Beach,5,"Nostalgic Place which has been Upgraded
Used to go to this beach when it was all undeveloped- no running tracks, carpark or playground.

Now that it has all those, the charm of the wild is lost but you get some convenience.

Beach still looks inviting and it was wonderful weather today - sunny but wind kept it cool."
Changi Beach,5,"It's lovely here, right next to the Changi Village hawker centre and Changi ferry terminal.

In the morning it is incredibly peaceful and beautiful, you will see the occasional jogger or fisherman (or maybe a lone kit) passing by. Otherwise you can really tune out and wind down here to connect with the world and escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre

As a rite of passage when visiting Singapore, you definitely should make a day trip and come to watch the sunrise on the beach and then take a ferry to Pulau Ubin."
Changi Beach,4,Beautiful sunset available here!
Changi Beach,5,Beautiful and serene
Changi Beach,5,"Nice sea view...
Relaxing and enjoying your weekend!
Good for picnic ..."
Changi Beach,4,"This is my next best beach, especially during covid. As you dont encounter rude sda here.
Be careful when the tide is out, beach is not good a swim because of the mud. Best when tide comes in as the mud will be further away.
Always keep your eyes out for fishing hooks scattered around. Quite a few irresponsible anglers fish there and make the fishing community look bad by behaving like idiots."
Changi Beach,5,All time favorite any time of day or night... must visit
Changi Beach,5,"It's actually a escape from the urban Area. There's a great Hawker there with good food, bread shop and accessories shop n so. It's a great place for the family. At one part(changi beach carkpark2) of the beach, you can lay down and watch the ✈️plane to land at close range."

Cyclists also use the area but we'll defined pedestrian and cycling path keeps everyone safe. Cyclist were also at a sane speed of course. Was really windy and cool. So it was a nice walk and chat.

We visited in December 2020 mid week, with the park quiet making for a relaxing time."
Changi Beach,5,Took a sunday afternoon stroll along the beach walk to clear my head. You can ride a bike or a scooter or just lay on the grass and enjoy the breeze... Some people might prefer fishing along the shore. Whatever the case its a nice place to relax and unwind

Changi Beach,5,"I agree with others that an early morning visit is really a great time to watch the day unfold over the sea and be carried to the shore on platinum tinted waves that burst into gold as they unfurl along the pale sandy beach. In addition, there are paved paths for easy cycling or jogging, plus picnic and bbq areas. Many shade trees or fun sun, your choice.
I would recommend water shoes for wading. I would not swim here, though, as this is a major shipping thoroughfare and oily seas are sometimes an issue. Consider bug repellent as mosquitoes or sand flies are occasionally bothersome."
Changi Beach,4,"A nostalgic beach which was once very popular to all Singaporeans. It is still a great hangout for malay families as offer space n privacy in this long stretch of beach. A beautiful scenic place that offers tranquil n relaxation from the hectic   busy life if one enjoys fishing or tanning .

Changi Beach,5,"Nice and breezy, Best cost free relaxing area"
Changi Beach,5,Great breeze and peaceful
Changi Beach,4,Enjoy quiet seabreeze.
Changi Beach,5,"Easy access, windy & still able to see plane flying across at close view. Can go for nice meals at changi village within walking distance. 😄"

Changi Beach,5,Great place for a walk.
Changi Beach,5,Nice Beach Park. Well managed!
Changi Beach,5,Very peaceful be place to go for the weekend. Do note that it is hard to get a bus on weekends if you are going to the edge of the park close to ALPS (Only bus service 35 ends early)
Changi Beach,4,"Singapore's only natural beach with the best seafront view... An unpretentious hangout (but no less popular) for beach lovers, cyclists, Airplane enthusiasts and foodies too!"
Changi Beach,5,Nice windy place for family outing activities. Easy access for car park !
Changi Beach,4,It's clean. Windy. At night you don't see the trash and listening to the waves is a good way to while away. Bonus points for the planes that fly overhead to land and take off from the nearby airport.
Changi Beach,5,Amazing. Unexpected. Aeroplane landing view is amazing.
Changi Beach,5,Cool and relaxing place
Changi Beach,5,"Very relaxing place . . Good for fishing , exercising , breeze walking , kite surfing and also small group gatherings"

Changi Beach,4,"One of the beaches that you can visit to relax, sometimes quiet and sometimes also crowded"
Changi Beach,5,"nice, not crowded. maintenance a bit low on beach, so the beach is a bit dirty which makes u feel natural. different from other beach of singapore."
Changi Beach,5,Less crowded than other parks and you can easily find a place to sit and watch everything unfolding around you. The proximity to the sea means there is a constant breeze to beat the Singapore heat as you watch plane after plane arrive at Changi Airport.
Changi Beach,4,It's a really great beach park especially at the end of the year when it's usually overcast and very very windy. Nice to just stroll along and enjoy the sea breeze and the waves. You can also view planes taking off from the Changi Airport runway nearby. There's a Sea Grill bistro by the beach at which you may enjoy a meal and enjoy the views. Further up shore near the hawker centre is the famous Melaka Chendol which is certainly worth the calories sacrificed
Changi Beach,5,Nice place to go with family.... easy access to lot of shops and eateries......maintenance was quite good also .......
Changi Beach,5,one of the awesome places of singapore. you will find a quite and peaceful sea beach there. best for campaign.

Changi Beach,5,Peaceful windy breeze
Changi Beach,5,It gives us a view of aeroplanes flying from Changi Airport.
Changi Beach,4,"One of the lesser known parks in SG. Not much people visit here, even on Sundays (when I visited). Near one of the airport runways; it is common to see flights taking off/landing from this spot. Frequent (every 10 min) public buses to nearest MRT stations. Place is near SAF ferry terminal. Hence, many of the landmarks around here are not allowed to be photographed. There have been urban legends of paranormal activity and bodies washing up though..."
Changi Beach,5,Nice place to go for a morning walk.
Changi Beach,4,A very relaxing place. Love the breeze.
Changi Beach,5,Clean and beautiful... It has been ages that I was here.

Changi Beach,5,One of the most fun places to visit with one of the best food courts nearby this place is perfect for anyone.
Changi Beach,4,Super.  Just don't turn up very early morning unless you enjoy seeing campers and undies drying.
Changi Beach,5,Convenient as there are bustops and amenities around..
Changi Beach,5,"It may seem like an ordinary beach. But I love this place. There are many good things about this one - you should start from the right most point, where you can see the aircrafts passing over your head for landing, you will feel like jumping to touch them each time 🙂 (pre-covid Ofcourse, and don’t sigh, there will definitely be a post-covid period too).
As you walk toward the left you will see families having picnics, there are many bar-be-que pits, kids play area, people with their hooks in the water waiting for a catch. beside the crows, mynahs and pigeons you can easily spot cockatoos, hornbills and parakeets. I particularly like to climb up those wonderful trees,as it takes me back to my childhood. The left most point in the park, an oval shape beach, is my favorite part, it’s a good point to spot otters too. It is also the area from where you can catch a ferry to the wetlands in pulau-ubin just by crossing a foot over bridge. Please go and enjoy !!!"
Changi Beach,4,"Nice beach park in Changi Village, close to Changi airport. Good opportunity to take a stroll along the beach. There is a ferry terminal close by which offers rides to Pulau Ubin."
Changi Beach,5,Loved this beach....one of the best place for a Weekend evening..watching the flights ✈️taking off is a sight to eyes.

Changi Beach,5,Beautiful and very relaxing place. Walking here is really very pleasant.
Changi Beach,5,I ENJOYED A LOT
Changi Beach,4,My favorite beach park in Singapore. It's small and less fancy that the others but in being that way is a bit more enjoyable
Changi Beach,5,Low human density makes it a good place for beach goers to relax. Its always good to relax there once in a while.
Changi Beach,5,Excellent views of landing aircraft.
Changi Beach,5,"Scenic sea view. Waters and sand so so but main focus is wind and of course, food. And theres always flyby of lowing flying aircrafts. Bbq pits and gazebos. You can swt trnt tok with a free permit."
Changi Beach,5,A good place to chill during covid-19 phrase 2. Bring yr beach stuff and enjoy the sea
Changi Beach,4,nice view
Changi Beach,5,Come and experience the other side of Singapore.. The one that is not pretentious and real.
Changi Beach,5,"A nice breezy place for playground, sandplay and plane watching. The plane couldn’t get any nearer at this place."
Changi Beach,4,"It's very windy, also gateway to Pulau Ubin. It's very nice you can go picnic there with your family."
Changi Beach,5,"Whether windy or still air, the park is a great walk with lots to see, hear, do. Have a good time here with people you hold dear."
Changi Beach,5,"Strong and Nice Wonderful windy, feel very peaceful"
Changi Beach,5,"Nice beach, but can get crowded"
Changi Beach,5,"Went there on a Sunday afternoon to cycle and to get some fresh air. The sky was turning sour, but the wind from the sea was crisp and felt good. No huge crowds on the eastern side of the SAF Ferry Terminal, which made it an ideal place to cycle without being overwhelmed by people wandering into your path. After all that effort, head to Changi Village Hawker Centre for dessert and drinks. There is enough going on there from morning till mid afternoon."
Changi Beach,4,Nice and tranquil park to see bumboats heading out and ships heading into East Johor Straits.
Changi Beach,3,I kind of miss the sea breeze and were there for an afternoon walk and makan. Beach is clean and water as good as you can get in spore. Good for family outing and picnic away from the city.
Changi Beach,5,I enjoy most is when you see the plane closer before going  to land.
Changi Beach,5,"As usual during public holidays lots of people gathered around together despite the COVID-19 rules & regulations.Strolling,cycling,jogging & etc the usual routines of everyday workouts besides others taking the breezes of the winds along the beach with families & friends....."
Changi Beach,1,Nice beach rilex2 bbq
Changi Beach,5,Changi Beach Park is one of the oldest coastal parks in Singapore where you can spot airplanes landing and taking off while enjoying the beach
Changi Beach,4,"Really peaceful and relaxing, and extremely beautiful especially at night. Best part is that sky is always lit with airplanes flying close to the beach"
Changi Beach,4,"Nice place to take a stroll.
Best part is see viewing planes landing or take off.
Lots of playing options for kids
Quiet and serene, except for occasional planes passing overhead, as the beach is located beside the path of planes approaching Changi Airport.

Facing Pulau Ubin and Tekong Island, this beach is rich in history. It is one of the places where British allied forces tried to repel Japanese forces during World War II.

On this beach, the sook ching massacre or purification killings were done by the Japanese military on Chinese civilians suspected of being enemies.

Now, it is a place of recreation where people spend time with their families and friends."
Changi Beach,4,"lived in singapore for 4 decades and have not stepped onto this beach before. although small, it's gorgeous. beautiful deep water and white sand.
it could b becoz of the facing or a land ending.
the shady trees and lawn like grass patches make it an idyllic beachfront park. the area is also steeped in WWII history.
would b better if there were more offerings of F&B in the vicinity, but then we could easily walk to changi village nearby."
Changi Beach,5,Beautiful sea view and delicious hawker food there! You can watch the plane up and down all days
Changi Beach,4,"Changi Beach Park....its basically a place for you to getaway to...if you don't live near the place.
I had my dinner with my family at the Hawker Centre nearby before going to the park to talk a walk. It's amazing how theres alot of beach areas for you to play in. Also theres a park connector leading there, so if you are adventurous...try reaching there from Pasir Ris Park."
Changi Beach,5,Great for cycling and sightseeing.
Changi Beach,5,Open to all ages... surrounded with  affordable good food. Chillax places
Changi Beach,5,Nice place for jogging

Changi Beach,4,Best place in  Singapore to watch airplane landing is at barbecue pit #8 in Changi beach park
Changi Beach,4,A nice park for a slow walk after lunching at Changi Village hawker.
Changi Beach,5,"Relaxing beach. Can spend 4-5 hours on weekends to refresh. Children have sand and play area. Can watch planes and ships. Cycle, ship and plan can be clicked in one picture. Drinking water available on beach. Cycle can be rented. Kayaking boats also available. Ferry terminal which cost 3$ per person to nearby islands."
Changi Beach,4,It's a very nice and peaceful place for people to enjoy and tour around. The environment is really good with a beautiful beach.
Changi Beach,5,Old families village since 1950
Changi Beach,4,Good place to hang out and enjoy your evening
Changi Beach,4,"Come here before full sunrise and enjoy alone time with nature. One can also enjoy the sight and sounds of flying airplanes. By 8am, more people are starting to come. After that, have a delight on local foods and drinks at reasonable prices! I was so amazed at my coffee of less than a dollar as of this writing. Normally kopi costs a dollar and few cents. To wrap those nice things, the public transportation is very convenient, the bus stop is just outside the food area."

Changi Beach,5,Beautiful park with a fitness corner and playground (with 4 swings)! Great place to bring the family to view airplanes landing too :)
Changi Beach,5,its a beautiful place
Changi Beach,5,"Nice park, easy to get there but hard to go back if you live south of this place due to the hills. This park is the only park that I know that has a continuous PCN of 36km towards gardens by the bay, a good place to train for long distance events if you need to. Plenty of toilets and a nice view of the one of a kind trees that you will encounter there and will not see anywhere else(except for Coney Island)

Btw one tip, visit this place at the weirdest of times like raining, I will promise you the view to the sea is spectacular."

Changi Beach,5,"There's is so called a bar/restaurant along the beach and maybe quite pricey. But overall, there are more great local delicacies at Changi Village and you can take a boat to Ubin from there. Just enjoy the walk at the beach!"
Changi Beach,4,"Nice place for a leisurely stroll with family or your GF/ BF/ BFFs with the soothing sea breeze and chill vibes this place gives, works wonders for the mood. Weekends sees multi-generation families pitching tents or laying mats on the sand and simply lazying under the shades provided by coconut trees. Best part of this beach in my opinion is near the vicinity of car park 1 and 2, where The Seagrill Bistro & Bar is located, here's where the bicycle rental can be found, and a decent meal and ice cold beverages (bonus: happy hours for almost the entire weekdays) are within reach on hot sunny days (PSA: choice of alfresco seating so that you can be near to the sea to soak in the breeze, or indoors seating available for you to chill.)"
Changi Beach,5,Nice white sand beach and very close to eatery and public transportation

Changi Beach,5,relaxing my mind
Changi Beach,3,No fish XP
Changi Beach,4,"This is a fairly long stretch of beach with cafes, playgrounds and bbq pits nearer to the Changi Village portion. The waters here are generally deeper, hence as you walk further, there's none of these amenities but rather parking spots, pavilions and benches. Most of them used by anglers... If you look down from the barricades lining the pathway, you may see man made hexagonal structures that encourage growth of various types of marine life."

Changi Beach,5,not bad
Changi Beach,4,The only downside are the toilets
Changi Beach,4,"Great place to go cycling, go jogging or spend time with family and friends. You can sit by the beach and watch the sun set and watch planes fly above you, do note that it can get loud because of the planes flying at low altitude but it depends on the season and weather as sometimes the planes will land on the other side of the runway depending on weather conditions and season so that could be a pro and a con (pro: less noise, con: if u came there to watch planes then you’re out of luck) there are also toilets available there and vending machines selling drinks and there is also water fountains. You can easily get mosquito bites there though so make sure to spray insect on yourself before going there. There’s only 1 restaurant there but I’m not sure what they sell, I think it’s more of a bar. There are many parking spots available there and most of the time the parking lot is empty. You can also easily get there by taking Bus service 9, 19, and 89."

Changi Beach,5,"Amazing place to just walk , take pictures or for a family picnic.

Quite near the hawker centre, so it's convenient to get a meal after enjoying the park"
Changi Beach,3,"This is a great place to go and watch the planes coming in to Changi Airport. Its got a great bike trail here with BBQ pits. Sunday is a really busy day down here so you have to watch out for lots of people. There are also bike hiring shops here as well, so if you want to go for a ride along the path, you will get to some quiet areas where you can be alone with your thoughts and the other occasional riders."

You can  observed aircraft take off right above the park."
Changi Beach,4,"It has been two years since my last visit to Changi beach where the entire beach was almost covered by hoarding.

Changi Beach,5,Feel happy to see both ship and areoplane near beach
Changi Beach,5,"Great place to relax. Enjoy the warm breezes and watch the planes approaching to land at Changi Airport. Planes approach at an average of one every 2-3 minutes.

You can also watch the sunrise, swim in the warm waters or just walk along the sandy beach. Where we were (Carpark 1), there are some shelters, benches, a free public toilet with showering facilities, a children's playground and a store selling hit and cold beverages, snacks and renting out bicycles. For more choices and cheaper food and drinks, just cross a small footbridge to get to the Changi Village Food Centre where some stalls are open 24/7.

Some observations to note. The shelters seem to be ""permanently"" occupied by some people though. You can even see their laundry hanging on the trees and bags of their possessions scattered throughout the shelters."
Changi Beach,3,Much of it is boarded up currently which makes life difficult. Good open stretch though. It is better up by Changi Point where the ferries leave. Good open areas for family and kids. It was packed on a Sunday!

Great to do biking, skating, jogging, making BBQ with family or friends, viewing low flying air crafts, etc. After having dinner at the nearby restaurant, then rambling around the Sandy beach while feeling the sea breeze, it's perfect. Sadly, camping is not allowing anymore here."

Temple of Sri Kailawasanathan Swami Devasthanam Kovil,2,"Sri Kailasanathar Swami Devasthanam, or Kapikaawatha Shivan Temple as it is also called by its devotees, is the oldest Hindu Temple in Colombo. Dedicated to the gods Ganesha and Shiva, the temple has been around for over two centuries. It’s also one of the most beautiful temples in Colombo.

History
The temple was built in Maradana, Colombo by a group of Indian Chetti traders known as ‘Thiruvilanga Nakarathar’ who moved to Sri Lanka for business two hundred years ago. King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha ruled Kandy at the time; while the Dutch had taken over the coastal regions and were managing the incoming trade. It was in this environment that the Chetti traders disembarked in Sri Lanka. They were Hindus and worshipped a small Sivalingam that had been kept under a tree by the other Hindu Chetti traders who lived in the area. The Thiruvilanga City Chettis felt that it was not right that there was no Hindu Temple in Colombo, that had been built according to the Vedic Scriptures. So he brought it up with his fellow traders and they agreed to build such a temple.

In 1783 the foundation was laid within the lands of a Chetti trader known as Sri Veerapathran. This same trader also accepted the responsibility of finding the finances for the construction, and the construction work itself. As the group of traders were the foremost and richest people in Colombo at the time, they had no issues; and soon the temple was built. The ritualistic opening ceremonies took place in the proper manner and the Hindus of the era in Colombo started visiting the temple regularly.

At the time the temple was called ‘Captain Gardens Temple’. The name was gotten due to the Dutch officer who was responsible for overseeing the trade operations in the area of the temple. He was called Captain, and the area he stayed was called ‘Captain Gardens’.

The Features
The temple has been created by skilled temple architects and sculptors straight from India; and maintains the classic Hindu temple look that is rarely seen on Sri Lanka. The colorful main tower with its detailed sculptures, intricate lotus-carved main door, solid stone statue masterpieces and other such aspects make the temple a beautiful sight for sore eyes. In addition to the main shrine dedicated to God Shiva; a number of shrines to other Hindu Gods and Goddesses encircle the main sanctum.

Included in these satellite shrines are shrines to Ganesh, Skanda, Dhurka, Vairavar, Ambaal, the nine planetary bodies, Kali, Brahma, Sandeswarar and many others. Visitors have to take off their footwear and wash their feet before entering. They are also not allowed to take photos of the insides of the temple, unless proper prior approval is gained.

Today Kailasanathar Swami Devasthanum is one of the most popular temples in Colombo, with its devotees numbering in the tens of thousands."

Hort Park,4,Nice park with a diverse type of plants within them. The English Garden is very nicely maintain. The pool at the main entrance has some tortoise. Popular area to hold wedding reception and also wedding photo shots. Highly recommended to come with kids and enjoy a lazy morning or afternoon here.
Hort Park,5,"Such a beautiful and serene place for a walk. Good place to walk the dog too. We were there for a stroll this morning (been here many times) and there was quite a lot of people. After all it’s a Saturday. Easy parking, lots of shade, even if it’s hot, it’s quite shaded by the trees and plants. There’s also a cafe and a restaurant. Lovely place all in all."
Hort Park,5,"The beauty of nature and the lush greenery fills this place, leading you all the way to Kent Ridge park. I am most impressed by the toilets. Very picturesque and CLEAN even on a weekend. Thank you to the janitors who tirelessly keep it clean and comfortable for visitors :) The park is spotless as well.
Walked here during night time a few times and it was quite safe but won't recommend walking alone. There are some migrant workers / gardeners working at the gardens despite the blazing sun. Do consider getting them some cold drinks from the vending machine nearby (photo 10) if you have the means to. We got 2 cold can drinks for them for only $2 and they were very touched! Let's appreciate our unsung heroes whenever we can 🤍"
Hort Park,5,"Got there late around 8 pm at night. It was quiet and the lighting creates a different atmosphere than in the day.  Had a nice, relaxing walk around the place."

The area and toilet and diaper change is very clean too. Definitely will come back soon!"
Hort Park,4,"Would suggest to take the trail walk that lead to Henderson Wave but if u would like to see difference garden that lead all the way to Kent ridge park, this would the way as all along the way there are differences theme garden n children playground too, n glasshouse that house some very colourful beautiful flowers... Good for a family outings..."

Easy parking.  There are currently two restaurants.  The park can also be connected to other places"
Hort Park,5,"You can access this park via its main entrance at Alexandra Road, side entrances along Pasir Panjang or walk down the gentle slope and stairways along the Canopy Walk at Kent Ridge Park as it is connected. The beautiful but long walkway winds down the ridge like the roads that wind down the mountain in Italy.

There are many thematic sections in this park. Each rather small but most well maintained. The Balinese Garden must be a joke as there is nothing Balinese in it except the two stone figurines at the entrance. There are glasshouses which are research labs owned by Gardens by the Bay and they offer a free tour.

Hort Park main building is quite impressively surrounded by a Silver Garden, a beautiful lawn, two restaurants and a retail outlet selling plants and garden needs.

There is a multi purpose hall facing the lawn and quite a grand entrance driveway if you want to arrive in style and have your wedding there. It is no wonder that Hort Park has won prestigious awards from overseas.

From here you can walk across the Alexandra Arch and onto the Southern Ridges boardwalk through a Forest Walk all the way to Henderson Waves, Telok Blangah Hill, Mt Faber, Harbourfront, Vivo City and Sentosa."
Hort Park,5,"Located in the Southern Ridges, HortPark connect Kent Ridge Park with Telok Blangah Hill Park. This picturesque park is full of flora and fauna.

From there you can walk in to the many different themed gardens inside. Plenty of good photo spots with a few playgrounds inside. Perfect place to bring your kids or walk your dogs. Walk all the way to the end & you'll reach Kent Ridge park for another set of attractions such as the canopy walk. Would drop by again when free👍🏼"

Hort Park,5,"A nice place for a morning or evening walk. Situated along Alexandra road, its convenient with ample parking.  Bring a bag pack with water and a hat. This park links to the Bukit Changdu canopy walk and Southern Ridge walk. Bring the kids for the exercise and get some fresh air."

Hope you and your friends will enjoy in here."
Hort Park,3,"Best you find a day, start early in the morning and walk visit from kent ridge park to mount faber park, exit at near harbourfront exit. There is vivo shopping mall and harbourfront MRT. I take 5+hours walking visit for this journey, if you are able and up to it."
Hort Park,5,"Originally I thought I would be hiking in a forest like at MacRitchie. Boy was I wrong! This park is more of a mini botanical garden 😄
The garden is very well designed and maintained. You can see orchids that are 100 years old! It is very family friendly.
This park is about 1km long, but it connects to a series of other parks."

It is connected to Kent Ridge park and the Southern Ridges, so those want more workout can go beyond the park. Th park itself is a wonderful place to chill out and spend quality time in a beautifully landscaped garden."
Hort Park,5,Have and always be my favourite go to for a cheap but oh so wonderful place for rest and relaxation. And you will still gain additional knowledge here about the flora and fauna if you have the time to read.
Hort Park,5,"Great outdoor visit for those who enjoy outings. Weather is sunny and hot. Under the many canopy trees, you get to enjoy soothing breeze with dancing butterfly and sound of birds. If you are a mosquito magnet, remember to apply insect-friendly repellent (lemon grass type). Kids enjoy the playpark."
Hort Park,5,"Go the often as it is a nature jewel in our city!! Very well maintained it provides an atmosphere for all type of visitors and functions. Various walking ways, different themes. Never boring as the same plants look different just by the change of the light."

There are beautiful blooms for photography too."

Hort Park,4,"Nice place to go if Ur looking for a more natural place to go compared to gardens by the bay. Relatively more ulu seeing u have to walk up the hill from the bus stop. Not sure what's the crowd like since I came at night, but pretty sure it was somewhere around botanic gardens level the previous time I came. Not the best idea ever to come at night since it's kind of hard to see anything. Flower gardens were the only thing I could capture."

Hort Park,4,Attended a wedding here. This is an ideal backdrop for a wedding. It has a nice lawn with greenery as background. The nicely manicured garden come out nicely in the photos. Ample space with air-condition for guests to dine in.
Hort Park,3,"Edit - The Nature Playgarden is currently in total disarray due to lack of maintenance (29 Dec 2020). Signs are missing, tools for children play are missing and the whole place just looks totally different from the manicured garden that it was when opened by the minister. Hopeful it is temporary and under 'upgrading'.

The Host Park itself is still nice with a newly opened cafe and nursery.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Great place for children to room around on top of nature. Let them walk bare foot in the ground. The new Nature Playgarden is nice.

The amenities are also good. Toilet and shady places to sit."
Hort Park,4,"Nice and relaxing place to walk. Not too crowded, with a lot of different types of plants. It's walking distance to Vivocity. But there is not much shelter so it quite hot."
Hort Park,5,"Highly recommended. Whether you are in Singapore only for a few days, HortPark is a must see destination and every tourist and locals have to reserve at least several hours for this beautiful place. To save your time and simultaneously to see maximum places of the park, it is recommended to start your walkway at the Alexandra Arch bridge and finish it at VivoCity shopping centre"
Hort Park,5,Gardener day out event is awesome. Offers many indoor and outdoor plants at affordable prices. Must go!
Hort Park,5,"I love this park very much. Very peaceful and wonderful gardening, clean and green location, calm and nice to walking, jogging, children's favourite nature themed playground, many varieties of plants, flowers, fruit trees, nice Photography views. Excellent location. School holidays time I and my friends, children's go there.
Long days after I go there. Really Amazing and fantastic gardening hub."

Hort Park,5,Amazing place. Perfect for dogs and family. Not too crowded as well. All amenities are clean.
Hort Park,4,It's been a long while since I last visited Hort Park.  One of my favourite park in Singapore. They are constantly changing the themes for each plot.  However I must said it seems to be growing more tropical produces now and a reminiscent of old kampong days.  Seems to have lost a bit of shine of of its heyday of beautiful plants and flowers few years back.
Hort Park,5,Was at Hortpark Day Out. Quite crowded. Is an good event. Will be there when next one comes.
Hort Park,5,Wow. Very cool. Thanks Singapore government or some privatized branch of something or another!
Hort Park,4,"Liked that the vending machines are payable with ez link card and cash. Toilets are accessible and it's a beautiful park. Never engaged in the visitor services so couldnt rate them on that. The lifestyle corner gives you a break you needed if it ever gets too hot. Overall, good review"

Hort Park,5,What a beautiful place! Lovely place to take a walk in. It's connected to Kent ridge park and you can start walking at Hort park and walk into Kent ridge park and the southern ridges.
Hort Park,3,A very leisurely place considering in the middle of pandemic. Got to wear mask unless engaging in strenuous exercise. A long walk to the pond area. Lots of map along the way so you will not go missing..:) Plant and fruit trees along the way. Breezy now in Jan 2021. Nice restaurant where you can have a meal after all the walk..
Hort Park,5,"I love this place for family shoots. Clean, neat, and spacious."
Hort Park,5,So many interesting horticultural exhibits and activities. Very well maintained and showcased.

The design, nonetheless, is unique with thematic gardens being cultivated.  Love the well aged trees here too."
Hort Park,5,Lovely place to come for hiking and walking. Lots of place and nature here. Those who like plants will surely enjoy. It's in-between Kent ridge park and mount Faber.

Hort Park,5,"I like exploring parks, this Hort Park offer 2 different paths to explore,one is from the earth trail means harder more nature walking ground,feels like passing by forest. The other one is passing by the metal bridge which gives the view from a higher place. This park leads me to the handersen wave bridge."
Hort Park,4,"A well maintained park with many different sections devoted to different types of horticulture, try to do as part of your southern ridges hike!"

Hort Park,4,Came here for department team bonding. The food didn't disappoint at all. Nice place to explore and learn more about plants...

Hort Park,5,Nice place to Jog
Hort Park,4,"Its beautiful and green. But in Singapore's weather, it is better to visit the park in the evening or early in the morning. It can be quite stifling in the afternoon heat and humidity to walk the park unless you are a sun person. However weather in 2019 is better so don't miss your chance. You may cross the Alexandra bridge to go over to the tree top walk at Telok Blangah Hill Park."
Hort Park,4,Very well organized with many variety of plants. Very relaxing place for family outing
Hort Park,4,Good place to go if you're a nature lover and tight in budget.

Head upslope to venture to the Henderson waves for amazing nature scenics at this little city. Place is pretty accessible with the nearest MRT Labrador Park."
Hort Park,5,"Tucked in amongst the skyscrapers is this gem of an educational resource for the kids and inspiration for adult gardners. The best way to get there is along the Southern Ridges walk from Mt Faber via the Henderson Waves, the Forest Trail and the Anderson Arch.

Hort Park,5,"HortPark, part of the Southern Ridges that comprises Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Park, is a one-stop gardening resource centre that brings together gardening-related, recreational, educational, research and retail activities under one big canopy in a park setting.

It is also a knowledge centre for plants and gardening, providing planting ideas and solutions, and offering a platform for the horticulture industry to share best practices and showcase garden designs, products and services.

Every month, we collaborate with our industry partners and members of various gardening groups to organise gardening activities for the public. School collaborations are also run extensively to initiate gardening awareness and nature appreciation among young children.

Gardeners' Day Out, a monthly event, is an extension of our mass outreach efforts. It provides interactive and fun-filled gardening activities to cultivate the spirit of gardening in everyone. Great plant bargains and offers are also available at our Gardening Bazaar, which is held at every edition of our Gardeners' Day Out.

At HortPark, we also actively promote the recycling mantra, ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"". If you have any gardening equipment or magazines to give away, do drop them off at HortPark. Other visitors may just find some use for them.

HortPark is popular with gardening enthusiasts, families, and community groups who yearn for a tranquil environment in which to relax, and is frequently visited by visitors who enjoy taking nature walks along the Southern Ridges."

Number of mosquitoes seem to be a lot though and I've never failed to get some lovebites.

It's a must-go place if you are hiking through Southern Ridges. Beyond it, go up to Canopy Walk as well for a great view!"

There is a unique spiral staircase that leads you down to the mini garden surrounded by a variety of function/ exhibit rooms.  At atrium level,  beside the toilet there is an artificial green ""eco environment "",can't remember the exact term,  that serves to promote the green movement.. At the corner of the atrium,  is an upclass restaurant, Vineyard..  Not yet tried though.. Do let me know if its good 😝"
Hort Park,5,Hort Park is a gem for garden lovers and families with young children. The silver garden is particularly lovely and the children's garden is wonderful fun.
Hort Park,2,"First I have to applaud to the contractor taking great effort mending the park. My children live the  environment. I have to give separate rating for the. A 4 star for them.

But 2 star who ever is in charge on the part. Knowing Singapore want to be a smart nation. But spending technology wisely to enhance productivity should be the focus rather being window dressing.

All these it’s our tax payer money. I wonder who is the “smart ass” suggest to use such a luxury product to mow such a small plot of lawn?

Firstly From various website show the autonomous mower should be range from $4,000 to $8,000. Does it justify to spend so much to lawn such a small plot? Is it efficient enough compare over a manual landscape technician using a hand held trimmer ?

If you want to impress please use a smarter way don’t make a fool on us for Singapore."
Hort Park,5,"This is a small but well-managed park. There are many bit size plants and some orchids inside* there are enough shades to make this a nice and comfortable walk. Prepare to spend up to 2 hours.

There is a restaurant called The Vineyard. The ambience and food are good for a quiet and relaxing meal."
Hort Park,5,An interesting place with lots of small gardens with some great ideas you can apply anywhere.

Hort Park,4,"This is a very nice horticultural park. It isn't that extensive, but it's a nice greenery area in the middle of Singapore. There is a retail section as well, and there's a very pretty restaurant on the grounds. So it's a place of calm that's worth walking around if you are nearby."
Hort Park,5,Beautiful Park. In night so bright.
Hort Park,4,"My first visit after hearing positive feedback. Was enjoying nature at its best when I heard loud chatters from a woman and her 3 young daughters. I was appalled to see the mum leading her brood to 'rummage' the shrubs for caterpillars 😳, even pinching lime from the plant😳.
They came equipped with a little pink container (matching their pink Reebok attire) for their caterpillars and insects. Container was held by the father!
No wonder I read visitors' feedback that they don't see butterflies coz of selfish people like them.
What a way to educate their young.
Hortpark should have enforcement to nab such visitors."
Hort Park,4,"Beautiful park, many flowers. Lots of benches to sit down and relax. Connected on both sides to other parks. Not a very big park."
Hort Park,4,"A small little green space that NPark is cramming with little activities. Vibrant and green, so do join in on some of the little green fairs, animal or pet carnival. Ample parking which somehow can be inadequate at times and it lacks stalls selling food and drinks. :)"
Hort Park,5,"My friend's wedding reception was held here! The olace was really inviting and the staff were polite.

The food spread for cocktails and dinner was AWESOME!!!"
Hort Park,4,nice park for families

Hort Park,5,V green and a good place for walking
Hort Park,5,"This place is underrated in the expat community. That is a beautiful place with plenty activities todo such as botanic discovery, walk run, gardening workshoo playground for kids. There is a lot of shadow compare to other parks in SG. The whole area is great deal with jubilee bridge, gillman barracks, mount Faber. Go early in the morning or at end of afternoon."
Hort Park,4,"Apply mosquito repellent and sunglasses. I came during the mid-morning and it gets progressively hot. Perhaps the next time I will come during the mid-afternoon instead. For those who are a bit adventurous, you should consider the top of Kent Ridge Park as your starting point. There is free parking. Taxi can reach there easily. From there, it is just casual 15 minutes stroll downhill."

Hort Park,5,"I was walking the Southern Ridges from west to east and this is one of the parks on that way. The part I saw in this park had many little gardens -- some flower, some vegetable, some experimental. While there is a building here, I did not enter it. There are drinking fountains and toilets, both free."
Hort Park,5,Great place for a nature walk. The starting point has some places to eat and vending machines. Recommend using the toilet there as there are no toilets during the journey. Total time to Faber Peak is around 1 hour.

Hort Park,4,Good place to stroll or Jog.
Hort Park,5,Nice and quiet place.

Hort Park,2,"Hort Park is hot....after walking all the way from Mount Faber.  Seems it is also hot with wedding couples for location shootings.

Drinks and snacks kiosks is a thoughtful idea. But wished there were some food outlets as well.

A good place to introduce young ones to horticulture. As for me, it is my sanctuary on days when I just need to be alone and at peace with nature."

Hort Park,5,"Did a solo 2-hour hike to The Southern Ridges Trail. One of the famous trails in Singapore that showcases the calmness and beauty of Singapore's nature away from the City. Saw lots of squirrels and monkeys during the travel. The architecture of the bridges and walkway are topnotch. I highly recommend this activity when you go to Singapore.

MRT Kent Ridge..Science Park..Kent Ridge Park..Canopy Walk..Edible Garden..Floral Walk..Forest Walk..Hort Park..Southern Ridges..Telok Blangah..Henderson Waves..Mount Faber Park..Faber Peak.

Best DIY hike in SG."

Hort Park,5,One of a kind
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Singapore’s only natural hot spring park, with charming and relaxing vibes. NParks has done a great job with the landscaping and the plants here are lovely. Suggest coming earlier in the day when it’s not so hot as the water is really hot! You can also bring some eggs to cook at the egg cooking section"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"good place... hot spring... water in Singapore.. no need go other countries. .. gate closes at 7pm.. ideal time after 4 pm..

nice and small eating place.. affordable price nice guy too."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"This is a simple and friendly place, off the beaten track, at the end of a 500m pathway through flowery gardens.  The foot bathing area is small and under the sun, so bring your own bucket for soaking your feet in a shaded area. The mineral water is soothing and there is something about sitting in the open air, relaxing and healing with others, especially the elderly, that makes this an authentic experience."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Visited there but closed for maintenance.  Surrounded by army base. Not too bad place to rest only occasional roaring noise helicopter circulating around the areas. 👍😊
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"First time here and I was impressed at the renovations that were made here. It was very crowded when I was here; there were many families enjoying the hot spring water with one another. I was really impressed that the visitors actually lined up to take turns to dip their feet in the pool. Most of them also brought their own basins and pails to scoop the spring water to dip their feet somewhere else. Talk about being responsible and considerate!

The park is also lined up with beautiful flowers with their name labels displayed. Some of the flowers are really unique and hard to find anywhere. I was really impressed at the flowers and some fruits that are still growing. Definitely will come back here prepared with basins too!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Very small park.  Interesting to see a hot spring in this hot climate island.  Pls bring your own pails if you want to soak your legs, otherwise you have to join the queue."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"clean and well designed. Water is very hot, must queue to dip your feet, but please wash your feet before dipping. Or you can take your own pail and dip it separately at a corner while waiting your eggs to be boiled."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"What!
There is a hot Spring in Singapore.
No way lah!
And it is really hot 🔥.
You can boil eggs here and enjoy the yummy half boiled eggs. It may be at least same or Evan better than ones you have in coffee shop.
Besides, you can also feel how Singapore pioneers really love the spring. They push up around the pool, shower freely beside the fausage, and really relaxed among the laugh and gassip. They deserve it since they built the roads toward the days we are now.
Bring your own basin and towel. Come early. Put you feet in the hot water. Enjoy it♨️"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"From Sembawang MRT station, take bus service 858 opposite the station for 6 stops where you will arrive at Block 114, followed by about 7 minutes walk to location.
First time there, totally unaware there is such a beautiful Hot Spring Park as From what I know formally it's was just with a single tap.
Entrance leading to the park is beautiful with the flowers along the way with an eatery and a clean common toilet.
Quite a number of visitor and many equip with own pail and big tub.
Hot Spring are actually good for our health, had a 20 minutes ""foot bath"" feels really relaxing.
There are HOT and also COLD water point for one to mix if found water temperature is too hot for comfort.
Egg boiling point where you could cook your own egg.
Many plants and flowers and even with a fruit garden.
A relaxing place for family outing but do take care of kids as water is HOT !
There is a need To ensure SOCIAL DISTANCING !"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The only hot spring that you can find in Singapore. Pls bring your own towel and bucket.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,1st time revisit after enhancements of facilities. More beautiful and spacious
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Such a nice place! To bad.. Temporarily closed due to pandemic..
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Interesting place to visit with family and friends, for a hot spring experience. The new cascading pools collects the hot springs water and allows the temperature to step down for different users. Along the path towards the spring have many local plant, floral walk and fruits trees on display for the public to gain knowledge from. Bring your buckets to avoid the long queues for the limited seating for the foot dip."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Visited this twice so far and love the experience. Free foot soak why not? Highly recommend that you bring your own pail so you don’t have to wait to for available seats at the foot soak area. Besides, I find it too hot to soak directly."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,This hot spring park is within walking distance from Chong Pang and is very popular with local especially weekends. A nice place to enjoy a hot foot spa. Best to visit on weekdays morning to avoid the crowds.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The Sembawang Hot Spring Park features Singapore's one and only hot spring and it is always crowded every day.

Best time to go is during mornings and evenings but that is when the crowd are there to enjoy the hot natural spring water so it gets rather congested. The park has limited shelter so it can get rather hot when the sun is right on top.

There is no parking available so visitors driving there will have to park at the nearby HDB carpark at Blk 114 Yishun Ring Road. From that carpark, it is about a 300m walk the entrance of the park.

The place for feet soaking is quite limited so most visitors will bring their own buckets to scoop up the water and soak their feet at the various shelters that they can find.

Overall, the park has just been redeveloped so it has a better layout with toilets and a small restaurant within the park."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,A very serene and peaceful place to visit . With fauna and flora that's colorful and refreshing.  The hot 🔥 spring really does have healing effects to me and I would assume it would be good for all who try it. Be very careful though as there are different levels of heat . Excellent
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Pls update the site if the place is closed! Wasting the time all the way to there....!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,A newly renovated hot spring park. The place is quite small with a path with flowers on the sides to the main hot print bath area. So surprised to see so many people enjoying hot spring under the hot sun. It is an interesting place to see but may not come back again.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place to soak your feet feels so good..
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"I have a good time with my parents. Most people brought their own buckets. I rent. 1.50 per bucket for 11/2hr. I will definitely bring my own buckets next time. The eatery provide a selection of food, coffee is nice, hope they can provide a few hot cooked vegan food."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place for a Sunday family outing. Its beautified since the earlier days and many species of flowers reside there now. And the designated locations for eggs boiling and communal leg soaks are great.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Written on: 01/12/2020
It was surprising to learn about the Hot Spring ij Singapore. The path leading to the Hot spring is beautiful with flowers blossoming. It was there during the Phase 2 of the Circuit Breaker (Covid19 pandemic) in Singapore and social distancing was encouraged and had to wait for someone to move out of the pool to get in. Swimming or full body immersion seems to be not allowed and only immersion of the foot is allowed in the main pool. People usually bring their own buckets to draw water from the main pool and dip their feet on the benches provided around it. It seems like a popular family outings. One end of the pool is hotter than the rest."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Amazing real hot spring park in Singapore. I am so happy it did not end up in the military compound during Chong Pang Camp redevelopment. Nice development to NEA to spruce up the place. Recommended for both local and tourist alike.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Discover it by chance when we were cycling from Yishun dam to Gambas Ave. Would say it better than my expectation of the place.

The nearest parking would be the HDB beside it. No parking at that location. Spotted a cafe beside it. It was Halal certified. From the main road it was just less than 5 mins walk or lesser. You can spot alot of folks carrying pails, thats a good indication you are heading at the right direction. Opens 7am to 7pm daily.

Bring your own pails and dipper (scoop) and eggs with container."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Not very crowded.  Good safety distance. Place to cook egg is need to share. Should have more water outlet.
Only have a few seats to get your legs in the hot spring. Else you have to take your own bucket to fill and do it else where."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Neat small hotspring park behind the Khatib camp. Favourite among the locals living around the area - they come here to soak their feet, cook eggs and generally have a good time. Remember to bring your own pail, eggs and other things you may need. There's a cafe and restrooms near the entrance."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice place! Great that the government/ relevant agencies decided to revamp this place. Very family friendly and teaches the kids about nature.
Just wish that visitors will follow the signs that have been erected that. Spotted many getting rid of the water in the plants when the signs obviously said not to.

The place provides pails and scoops, some bring their own.
Bring your own items if u want to cook eggs, there’s a special station for it."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice natural hot spring to visit, can rent the bucket from the nearby cafe, can bring your eggs for cooking as well"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Just want to share 7 learnings after visiting Sembawang Hot Springs: #1. Nearest carpark is at Blk 114 Yishun Ring Road. #2. Instead of bulky, unsightly pails, experienced people brought water bags to fill the spring water and soak their feet. #3. Eggs at most would be half boiled eggs BUT it has to be submerged in running hot spring water over half an hour. If you are not staying that long, don't bother bringing the eggs. #4. The spring water is drinkable. You can bring a container to bring some home. #5. Useful to bring small towels (like the good morning face towel) to soak up the spring water and wipe or wrap your limbs. #6 Useful to bring hot water bag to put over your aching body part. #7. Soaking my feet with hot spring water for 30-45 mins is therapeutic! I had consistent pain in my right heel, but after soaking, the pain was gone, my feet felt lighter... however it was only for a day... my pain came back😩"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Feeling really energetic once done this activity..
Good for blood circulation.
Advice to go the early in the morning.."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Close to nature . There is a cafe and toilet here .
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Came for the hot springs, stayed for the park!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Been there many times.

But when I was there on Monday 15/2 around 5pm was surprised with empty ponds.
Need to collect hot water from egg area.

Any update on the ponds? Is it back as normal?"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"It's a crowded place. Recommended items to bring for a better experience: bucket, water scoop, towel, eggs, containers for eggs cooking, bowl and spoon. My eggs cooking failed, definitely need longer cooking time than 20mins.
I did not enjoy my visit, but saw lots of others who did. Some half naked uncles were seen 'bathing' with the water, many were happily enjoying their foot bath. No safe distancing was observed though."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"A little off the track but thankfully still relatively easy to get to, just needed some walking. Glad to have this place not sealed off despite all the hoohaa a few years ago. First time here but turns out it is a really nice little place to spend some family time. Saw some people bringing tubs for kids to soak in, pails to soak legs. Pail rental is available of it is too much of a hassle to bring your own. Strict timing to close at 7pm. The spring water is real hot though, 70 degrees Celsius. Takes a while before it cools down enough for soaking, occasionally caught a whiff of sulphur, quite a number of people brings eggs to cook in the natural spring water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Hot place to gather with family and friends due to the heat from the weather as well as heat from the hot springs. U can take buses from Yishun which is about 8 stops and walk into the park, which takes about 7-8mins depending on how fast u walk. They dun provide u with soaking basins, so I highly suggest u bring ur own."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nostalgic place over 20+years before it was converted to park.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Very nice place. we have to bring our own bucket or mugs to have a hotwater massage, hotwater will heal your skin problems. Have to be very careful while placing our legs in the water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Like this place so much. The pool is small but is OK, you can bring your own pail and enjoy foot bath in the park.

If you want to have foot bath in the pool, you can consider to bring your own umbrella 🌂 coz there is no shelter and expose to direct sunlight~

Remember to bring eggs to cook perfect half boiled eggs within 30 to 45 mins. The timing depends on the water flows you got."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Relaxing...its free to enjoy the hot spring , be careful of the hot water flowing out of the tap , young children should not carry the wooden pail fill with the hot spring water. Parents please ensure safety as it will cause harm to you & the children. Enjoy."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Insufficient seating place nevertheless it is very well maintained and a nice place to chill out
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"If you would like a ""Sauna"" and relaxing place, it'll be here!
Bring a bucket along so you don't have to Q, or prefer hygiene, then you can collect your hot bucket of Hot Spring Water and steam your legs/feet.

Won't recommend to bath in the water. Can also cook Half-Boiled eggs. Would definitely revisit again and again!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Cool place to check out! Never knew we had hot springs in Singapore. It got pretty crowded on the weekend so we didn't try soaking our feet but it looked like it'll be really comfy. Bring some eggs along to test out the dedicated egg cooking section.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,The spring water temperature range from  45 to 70degC. There is a small cafe and toilet facility is available.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Wonderful experience here. Better to bring your own pails.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Things to note :
Maintenance days falls on Monday and Thursday, between 11am to 2pm, whereby they drain out the hot spring for cleaning purposes. During this period, there’s barely any water available so take note to avoid this timing!

It was a 5 🌟 experience solely because we were given free pails to continue our experience during the downtime! Special kudos and thanks for the uncle for this! 🙏🏻

There are varying degrees of water, ranging from 45-50-60-70 for different level of heat tolerance! There’s also heated pebbles available, which many uses to place on their body.

We also made some soft boil eggs like everyone does and it was awesome 🤤

It is crowded even on a Monday noon, so do avoid weekends if possible! Will probably revisit with parents for a free exposure!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Can cook eggs and soaked my feet in warm water..and thanks to very good uncle he let  me use his bucket...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Clean n very refreshing. Get to soak my feet n use the hot stone to relieve some stiffness.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"A place to chill after work, have a hot soak on your feet after a long walk.

After 18 months of works, it is indeed a place worth going to chill and to soak your tiring feet into the hot water.

Brought the kids there and they had lots of fun playing with the hot water and also a good experience to soak their feet in it.

💦 🦶🦶 🦶 💦"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Cozy place but please do come prepared (bucket, pail, eggs, soy sauce, bowl etc)"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Can relax put on legs inside the water and nice place too
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Nice place to relax. Bring your own mats, pails for personal comfort as weekends are crowded. Bring your own eggs to boil via the pipes provided at a corner."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Great place to relax with a hot foot bath and delicious hot spring cooked eggs.
It's just a bit far from cetral Singapore and better go there eqrly to grab a shaded area."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Free and well-maintained. Can be crowded. Important to bring your own pail.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The only natural hotspring in mainland Singapore (The other one is in Pulau Tekong). Recently renovated with the cascading hotspring fountain and park. Many benches available here to sit down and enjoy the scenery as well as to soak your feet in the hotspring waters. Remember to bring your own pail/bucket or basin as there are non provided. Free public toilet and a small cafe are also found within the park.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"I did not go to the old one back in the day but I heard it was just a tap and a few buckets. Based on that, this is a huge improvement! Everything is quite new and clean. After going to many parks in Singapore, this is really quite unique to this place. I wish there were more shady areas as it can get really hot on sunny days. It’s sad to see that people still dump the hot water in the garden even though the signs clearly ask to pour it into the drain"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place to bring elderly. Wished that they used the spring to make a pay-to-use onsen on top of the this free-to-use fountain.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Nice place. Not too crowded. Abit inaccessible. Need to walk about 400m from nearest car park. If it rain, there is limited shelter. Otherwise it is a good experience."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Sembawang Hot Spring where you can bring your own containers to collect the hot spring and deep your feet for a ""Hot Spring Deep."" You can bring your own eggs and container to cook your eggs using the Hot spring water. Can walk and explore the nature and Sembawang Park ."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Singapore’s only hot springs park, for a taste of Japan. Closes strictly at 7pm. No parking available here so the nearest carparks are at the HDB blocks nearby. Bring your own pail so you can soak your feet at your own leisure along the benches.

You will be greeted with beautiful flowers along a short walk from entrance to the hot springs park. The waters start from 70 degrees to 40 degrees. The optimal feet soaking temperature is around 40-42 degrees. You can also soak your feet at the communal area, but do wash your feet first.

There’s also an egg cooking station whereby you can place eggs under running tap for maybe 15 mins so it cooks to an onsen egg texture.

Can be quite crowded on weekdays evenings and weekends but an interesting activity for sure!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Japan stands out most when you think of enjoying a hot spring bath or dipping your feet into a bucket of steaming hot spring water.

Here in Singapore, the newly revamped Sembawang Hot Spring Park brings you a place where you can dip your feet into a bucket of steaming hot spring water, literally right in our doorstep (Singapore).

There are different temperature flowing hot spring water ranging from 70 degrees C to 40 degrees C.

You can also bring along fresh eggs to cook in the hot spring water too.  A word of advice though, you need to cook it at least 30 minutes or more.

My first trip there with my family was very enjoyable.  We brought along our own pails and basins instead of using the wooden buckets available at the park.  It is your choice.

Its a park suitable for the young and old, but please make sure you do not let your young children play with the water themselves to avoid being burnt.

Last but not the least, the sides of the path towards the hot spring has many beautiful flowers too."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Very Nice experience.

Semarang Eating House - Food  is very good"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Good soaking session... limited seating area. Crowded. No shelter.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"First time here, this place is planted with various flowers species which really caught my attention along the way to the spring park.
The hot spring is really hot. Quite an experience in this place."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"A good place to soak your feet, a lot of bucket need to wait when crowded. 70°C to half cook the egg need 30-40 minutes under running water.

The pool of spring base on your needs from 40°C when yiu cold sit down, 45°C etc"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Amazing see the nature’s magic of hot water from down under the earth . 😇
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Cheap thrill... Nice place and fun to cook eggs and soaking tired feet. Feet felt lighter and less painful. Though was unable to obtain a real hard boil egg even after 1.5hr of egg soaking in the 70deg C running hot spring water. However the taste is still great. Im not an egg yoke person, but I enjoyed the cooked yoke with mild runny white and (self prep) slice cheese. I will be back..."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Tks community & gov making great effort to revamp & maintain this nice park.  Facilities are well equip.  Many beautiful colorful plant along the pavement fr entrance.  Hot spring really hot, u hv option of 70, 60, 50 degC to suit ur personal preference.  45degC just nice for legs.  Remember dont over soak.  20 min just nice."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Natural hotspring! This park only has 1 restaurant and the hotspring, and some plants, nothing else. You will see quite a fair bit of people here, soaking their feet, and boiling the eggs using the hotspring water. Remember to bring your own eggs and pail if u want to soak your feet! Otherwise you can soak it in the communal one, which isn't the most hygienic in my opinion, though the high temperature probably kills off the bacteria. Worth a visit!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Awesome Place. Please bring umbrella when going there..😀😀
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice community park, the only hot spring in Singapore!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,What a find... clean and easily accessible on foot NO PARKING ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PLACE.. also there are no close or convenient bus stations nearby... however all the efforts to get here is worth it
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"We went at 7 in the morning on a Sunday and already it was crowded. Nonetheless it’s a relaxing and uncommon activity in Singapore (and free!) so head on down when you’re in search of something to do! When soaking your legs, there is a side that is less hot to start off with as you acclimatize to the temperature before heading to the hotter side. There are definitely helpful regulars/pros who will be able to guide you along, as they did for us. You might also want to bring your own bucket/towel to enjoy at a corner of the park when the main area gets too crowded. We really enjoyed the experience!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Free hot spring but too crowded. Can rent pail from the cafe at the entrance. Bring your own pail. No drop off / pick up point nearby and nearest car park is a 10min walk away.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place to visit in the morning and late afternoon when the sun is not so strong. It is a hot place. Remember to bring eggs to cook in the hot spring water and pails to soak your legs with the hot spring water.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Government had done a good job, it's well design, very clean and comfortable. Most important is free for public.
The Sembawang Hot Spring.
Thank you to all the people that had put in their hard work and make this place for all of us.
Only issue should be raining, there are very minimum shelter in the areas. Also far from the carpark and public transport. So be prepared for a raining day. There are one small coffee shop at the entrance.
Remember to bring your eggs and umbrella.
Wooden bucket are free for all to use."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Great place but pity that it's a little small so it gets extremely crowded! Bring your own eggs, cooking utensils and soy sauce."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice little hot spring, never expect to find one in Singapore! The public queued in an orderly manner to wait for their turn. Some would bring their pails/containers to soak their own feet. You could bring along some eggs to cook with the hot spring water. A very good experience!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice hot spring with great variety of flowers
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Singapore own hot spring. Open from 7am-7pm. Usually packed. Please be considerate and don’t go into the foot bath pool.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Steaming hot water from 45-70 degrees celcius, rumoured to be hot enough to cook an egg (do not attempt to eat it though) 😆

Sulphur smell tells of its authentic hot spring nature. A local onsen that has been renovated from the old taps to a waterfall like pool structure that you can sit and soak your feet in, at the lowest section which is also the coolest and most suitable for contacting your skin. It’s water is believed to have therapeutic properties so it is common to see people who bring their big tubs and soak their entire body in. Do bring your own tubs if you want to sit around and soak, as there are limited seats at the spring itself.

There is also a local cafe at the entrance of the Hot Spring for your dietary needs or to quench your thirst. But do not that there is NO PARKING available so for drivers, the best is to park at Blk 114 Yishun and walk over."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"SEMBAWANG HOT SPRING PARK
Very nice place"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Arrived at 8:30am on a Sunday morning and the park was quite crowded. As no parking is available at the park itself, closest carpark would be at the Yishun Ring Road HDB blocks, which is a 7min walk away from the park. Signages on the road are pretty clear - if in doubt just follow other pedestrians carrying a bucket🙃

There are very limited seats of you want to sit and soak your feet at the main fountain area - approximate queue time is between 15-30 minutes, depending on how crowded it is.

We brought our own buckets after reading tips online. A kind uncle taught us to fill the bucket with some cold water (available from two taps) before adding hot spring water into it. The coolest water is a whooping 45 degrees celcius - definitely too hot to soak in immediately if not diluted.

Also brought our own eggs and a container to cook them in. We easily found a spot at the egg cooking station. Water there is about 70 degrees celcius - for softboiled eggs, 17-19 minutes would be just right!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"First time there, took a wooden basin to collect spring water from tap was too hot. Waited for 20mins to let it cool down. After soaking for 15 mins, all my dead skin were gone, feet became very smooth. All the tension at my feet were disappeared"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Peaceful surrounding with lots of flowers along the way to the main water collection points. Nearest carpark will be at Blk 114. After which, it will be a 10-min walk to the park. At the footbath area, there are different temperatures of the water. There are very limited seating area hence do avoid peak hour to avoid disappointment."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Good place for relaxing, recommended"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The only Hot Spring in Singapore, recently re-opened for public.
Can be conveniently reached by Private or Public transport.
Park  Entrance leads to narrow strip of passage leading to Hot spring, the main attraction.
Cascading pools are built so as to let water cool down to comfortable levels so as to able to enjoy.
Pool is small, so feel lucky if find a place to sit directly in to it. But ample space with wooden pales all around are provided. Therefore can sit as per convenience and enjoy the Hot spring dip.
Best time to visit shall be in morning or evening during normal days, or anytime on overcast day.
Duration of 1 hour is enough to enjoy the Hot spring.
Basic facilities with a small cafe is a plus.
Park Closes by 7pm.
A good experience, if never had similar."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place for all.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Have  morning  breakfast and
own make half boil  eggs
.Quiet  same as breakfast
with Ah Mrng at the zoo."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Very small n crowded... not much park to walk. Small cafe for lunch. Good experience for hot spring. But need to wait
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Here, Enjoy a foot soak at the edge of the cascading pool where water gradually cools as it flows down four tiered pools! The pool mimics the hot spring in its natural state, where overflowing pools of hot water form after emerging from the ground. Water emerges at the top at 70°C and will flow out at the final pool at 40°C, which is the optimal temperature for contact with skin."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Bring your own pails to collect hot spring water for foot bath. No shelter at the common hot spring pool so it will be very hot under the sun, with steaming spring water in the pool. Expect long queue as this attraction is popular with visitors."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Small but great place to relax. Can jog here... Can soak in ""hot spring"" water!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,It’s good to enjoy foot bath.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Interesting experience, never seen a hotspring before. It's open air so it's sunny plus the water is hot. Would be better to have some shade. Limited seats here though so come early if you want to soak your feet in 50 deg water"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,nice little cozy corner in Singapore. With egg cooking corner
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The only hot spring park in Singapore, which is small but still worth a visit. It is a good idea to bring along a pail, a towel and some eggs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Free entrance. Wheelchair users friendly. Sembawang hot spring park can be crowded during holidays. There are: foot bath, hot spring water  collection point, educational zone, dining, and good to appreciate nature and heritage."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice place to chill, foot hot spa, cooking eggs. But have to bring your own barang though."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Fun to cook soft boiled eggs! Newly renovated and super crowded today, but it's much much much nicer than before! Also have walking direction signs at the bus stop and BIG Nparks signboard at entrance, so the place is easy to find.

I would recommend to buy eggs to cook at the cafe, but remember to only use water from the 70°C taps at the left side of the hot springs or eggs won't cook. The central fountain is only 60°C at hottest, so it's not suitable for cooking eggs. Cooking takes about 20-30 mins, and I recommend cracking the eggs back at the cafe so there is sauce and pepper to eat with. Also recommend to leave the eggs under the dripping tap if you don't have a lid to cover your eggs as the wind is quite strong and the water can cool quite fast.

Wooden basins are provided for soaking feet, but due to the sheer number of people I was unable to soak my feet. Some people brought their own pails and equipment, and I thought that was very smart too."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,The hot spring pool is healthy for foot bath. Some residents/visitors simply cook their DIY hot spring eggs there.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Very hot place as little shelter, but it is better after the renovation. Need to bring your own pails n scoops for soaking your feet."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,A great improvement to attract more visitors to Singapore's natural parks. Be prepared to bring your own tubs or pails in case it gets too crowded especially during weekends due its popularity.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great place to visit!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Renovated few years back. And became amazingly nice. Can get very crowded. Pick your hour
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The only hot spring in SG.
Well renovated for public use"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,More better got rent 1 room for soak whole body like at hot spring water Bandung
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Relax and enjoy..
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Interesting place to explore. Strongly encouraged to bring along your own pails or tubs to soak your feet with the hot spring water. Limited shelter so it's better to bring umbrella too in case it rains. There's a public toilet at the entrance and a small cafe (air-conditioned) selling a good selection of food and drinks. Rather enjoyable!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,A place that provides a unique experience for the family. It's hot!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The only hot spring in mainland singapore. The other hot spring is at Pulau Tekong, which is not accessible to public. After renovation, the place is much cleaner and with equipment for us to boil egg and soak our feets. Very relaxing. Some more, it is free. And there is one cafe available. A pity that the hot spring closed at 7pm."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Recently renovated park, small in capacity, possibly only hot spring in singapore"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Fantastic old historical place. Do visit it before the renovation starts. Not much signage but you will find a path way to the hot spring and once you are there just grab a pail and chair to soak your feet.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice to visit during mornings 8-9 am gets a little crowded during weekends. Also be mindful of the different water temperatures , nearly burnt myself :c provides buckets and ladles for personal use"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Sembawang Hot Spring Park is quiet garden tucked away from the city in a peaceful area near in an industrial region. It gained a lot of traction by the media, which garnered it's near 1000 reviews on Google Maps.

However, I feel that it is quite overrated. The Hot Spring itself is comfortable, sure, but is easily replicated at home with warm water. The main highlights would be the educational signages about the water and the local flora and fauna, but I'm sure most Singaporeans would not care about this.
It may not be worth it to come here if you do not live nearby."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Interesting place, a bit out of the way. No parking available, I would suggest parking at Chong Pang market and walk about 1.5km.

These Bus lines stop near Sembawang Hot Spring: 858, 969.

Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Nice place for family after renovation. The water a bit smelly, i think because of the sulfur. Water too cold to cook eggs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Nice and clean, water is way too hot to dip the feet in. Recommend coming here with buckets so you can enjoy on exact temperature you prefer."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Thumbs up turning this place into a park.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Bring your own pail as none was provided. The park was fairly crowded and the hot spring area is small.

There is an egg cooking area to make osen eggs. After 1 hour, the eggs are delicious."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Soaked my feet from the hot water overflowed. Understand there will be development to make it a tourist spot with facilities and food around.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,It is relaxing to my feet. The people are many even in the morning.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Nicely renovated. Best to go during off peak. Bring your own bucket as no more for loan due to covid.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Crowded but not too crowded. Still able to enjoy !! Will visit again on weekdays to enjoy the peace and footbath😊
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"No carpark at this location. If you are driving, park at the nearest HDB and walk about 200m to this park. Walk through a garden and a small field, you will see 2 hot water points. 50 degrees celsius pool for feet dunking & 70 degrees Celsius for cooking eggs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,A thoughtfully redesigned area with some shaded areas and ample buckets for people to soak their feet in. The water in the lowest rung of the pool is not that hot and can accommodate maybe 10-12 people sitting with their feet inside.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"It was closed due to covid. Please be aware of d cyclists, some were riding too fast..."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Had a good experience by soaking the legs on the hot spring water. Felt rejuvenated after a long walk at macRitchie reservoir. Improves blood circulation. Got separate tap for boiling eggs. A must visit place in Singapore.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Enjoy a hot spring at Sembawang Hot Spring. Please bring your bucket and bathing Scoop to scoop the hot water into your bucket. Sheltered seating areas are limited. Do come early or off peak hours.
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,The old hot spring park has closed down. New hot spring park is still being built. The temporary hot spring site has two pipes for visitors to use. It can be quite crowded at times. Need to wait to collect water. This temporary place is not good to visit. Better to wait for the new hot spring park.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Nice view, good scenery but with the amount of people there hogging the hot spring seats and water like they're paying for it."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Went there on a Sat noon. So sad forgotten to bring eggs! Great place to just chill and soak your feet in the HOT ground water. Bring some snacks and a portable fan if you're coming at noon, it can be pretty hot there."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Free hot spring but no car park nearby.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Compared to a decade ago, it has definitely improved. The various pools and numerous seats available. There is an area specially for cooking eggs, but you have to bring your own container to cook it in.

Other than the hot spring, there's a tiny cafe next to it for those not wanting to get scorched by the brutal sun. The menu there is simple. They seem to have containers for sale too, for those who forgotten to bring their own and do not want to use the communal ones"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice experience
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Our own little Singaporean gem in beautiful Sembawang. Water hot spring is really hot! Don't play play. Look at my lobsters...hehe!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,The place is well designed. Ample sitting area surrounded by a beautiful landscaped garden A small oasis for urban dwellers to unwind.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Hahaha it is just overwhelmed by the swarm of people flocking to this newly renovated place which is so much nicer than the previous setup. At least now you have decent water pool of different temperature and a foot bath pool (a little too small for the size of crowd). The place smells of egg too as everyone is cooking soft-boiled egg. Npark provided wooden buckets and scoop for people to use, and they setup tentage to shelter from the sun. But already some of the wooden bucket not able to hold water. Nevertheless Kudos to npark for this family friendly setup!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Definitely a unique place.

The idea is really great but something needs to be done about the smell of over cooked eggs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Nice place, the only hot spring in Sg. The place is quite small ( where you soak your feet ). Can rent a basin if you want, very affordable. There is a place to eat if you are also hungry!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Upgraded, renewed one and onlu hot pring in SG. It is worth the visit, however crowd is expected (no joke) and if u are really keen to soak ur feet, better to bring along ur own apparatus to avoid dissapointment. Basic amenities (washrooms and a small eatery)are avail on site. Overall a nice hot spring park in SG."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice place to relax with friends!

Cook a few eggs, use the buckets provided responsibly!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Walking distance from our house. A very simple setting..pls dont expect Japanese Onsen ambiance. Fun free thg to do in SG
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"There is no carpark here, nearest carpark should be at blk 114, 115b multi story carpark, 115B Yishun Ring Rd, Singapore 762115. Is 5 min walk from this carpark and there is ramp access. Don't recommend if it is rainy day, limited shelter. Recommend to bring own small pail or makeshift pail like using a plastic bag/ocean pack. Alternatively you can queue at the common pool but the queue is quite long, won't recommend common pool although its convenient. You can also rent a pail from the cafe beside. Needless to say the water is hot, 40°c up to 70°c. Common pool is 40°c still quite bearable. Toliet is very near, well builded facility."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Best place to relax during the weekend
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"A quite unique place in Singapore where provides a pool of hot spring to rest your feet. Not easy to access by the public transportation nor the self driving as there is no parking in this premise plus there is military facility just next door. The water itself has a special smell of sulfate but the temperature is comfortable. A spotlight is there is a cafe called SEH, Sambawng Eating House which provides quite reasonabily priced beverage and toasts."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Good place to relax though it maybe crowded as the place is not that big. Also the place is about 10 mins walking distance from nearby bus stop.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Super crowded now. Come early. Paddle pool is nice.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Bring along mosquito repellent.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"my family and i went there just to see what the hot spring had to offer and we realised that we were supposed (not compulsory) to bring buckets to scoop some water from the hot spring to let it cool down. the water had different temperatures at different heights, the tallest one was 70°c , the medium one was 60°c , and the most bottom one was 50°c. even though i went to put my feet into the coolest one, 50°c, it was still very hot so i would recommend people who want to come here to bring buckets to cool the water down. it was also quite hot and sunny when i went there so perhaps bring a umbrella in case."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"14 Sep 2020.
Main fountain under maintenance.
Still got somewhere to fill in hot water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Sembawang Hot Spring is currently suituated at SAF Camp.  The only hot spring in mainland Singapore. The water is heated deed underground. People can just seat around to soak their leg. There is no toilet facility.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Google Maps urgently need to update the walking directions to the hot spring.  The directions in the attached photo are NOT the correct way to the hot spring.
The entrance to the hot spring is off Gambas Ave about 150m west of the Gambas Ave/Sembawang Rd junction.
(The 5-star rating is for the place. Google Directions get zero star in this case.)"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Bring your own pail n silicon glove if there is.. The water is really hot unless u hv tolerable hands..
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Interesting place, maybe NParks should open the one on Pulau Tekong as well"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Lovely place
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"After renovation, the facilities were much better. Now have pails available and seats. Nearby also have toilets :)"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great time spends on foot spa & ppl there are open to socialise
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Very nice place.. especially the restaurant/cafe there. Definitely a good place to go...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very relaxing place especially with pain problem get apail along n warm the area you feel pain willrelief you pain .can shower goog for skin n body.Try this no harm.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"So much effort has been put in by Nparks. Sembawang hot spring is the Natural Jem of Singapore.The choice of fruit trees,shrubs and all other plants reminds of the past,(kampong days).
The only draw back is there is no proper drop off spot or a car park...mainly for elderly."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Let's hope that the Authorities would develop a Japanese style Onsen (dipping pool) one day.....
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Amazing place.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"I could not believe it is real hot spring by just looking at it. But hey its Singapore you are not cheated. Leaving the quest of real or not I started enjoying this place. Such a soul soothing warm feet bath. Eggs can be cooked. Water is hot upto 70deg. More than 60deg be carefull when you put legs in, it's real hot guys. See my panaromic photos have fun."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good facilities but no parking on site. Bring a bucket so you can soak without waiting for a spot.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good for when you need a relaxing DIY foot spa. Just bring your own bucket. You can also boil eggs there.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Still can improve for transportation wise for mass pubic frequency of visiting & enjoying for weekend outdoor activities.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Very nice and toasty water, ideal for soaking your feet. Conveniently located near a newly-built café for some snacks after soaking your feet.

Well-maintained with sufficient signage and facilities for collection and use of hot spring water

Sembawang Hot Spring,5,relaxing and therapeutic
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"It is a fascinating place. The hot spring is truly hot 70 deg C and smells of rotten egg sulphur. There were quite a number of people there, seems like everyone had a pail to draw the water and soak their feet in it. Some brought eggs to be cooked in the hot spring water. Thankfully a separate section is provided for the egg cooking away from the feet soaking people. It is rather small so don't expect too much. The surrounding park is pleasant. There is a Chinese restaurant at the entrance. Unfortunately for drivers, the nearest car park is a 10min walk away, at the nearest HDB block."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"In case you got questions,
Got vending machine selling cold drinks, Panadol,battery, got toilet here, got free drinking  water dispenser outside toilet, got bicycle bay, and sembawang eating house."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Try to avoid weekends. Crowded. Need to queue for enjoying the hot spring.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,This place has turned into a hot spot even for the youth...now it feels that the hot spring is too small n shelters are not enough.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"3 週前-
Very nice park with hotspring foot bath. area feels cooler than an air conditioned room at the park area. hotspring area had pails tubs and buckets for the public to use.
There are proper marked and designated areas for the amenities and facilities, clear instructions on the etiquette etc."
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Too many people. Cannot really appreciate the place and water due to the large crowds and feel very rushed. Got a lot of 'experts' who volunteer their knowledge on cooking eggs and even how to put your feet into the water...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Interesting place to explore, bring your own buckets to collect hot spring water. Simply dip your feet in, relax and enjoy."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"It free the most important , nice environment with bird singing , 100% relaxed , an excellent place to chit chat . No disruption."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Great family outing. Too bad I reach a bit late so its scorching hot. Remember to bring your own pail or container. Egg is a must bring to experience boiling soft boil egg. Bring bowl and spoon as well .
After that we went to the cafe here . It has yummy food and yet very affordable price. Kudos"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Quite a fun place to visit.
Pls bring your own pail or basin."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"During weekdays, it’s less people and enjoyable. Too many ppl in Weekends as usual. Hot spring foot spa is too hot for me and I can’t submerge my feet fully. But very nice spa."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Open area with many hot spring taps for public to use freely. You can soak your feet and even cook eggs.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Go early. 9am is Late...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Springs are closed for a while but the park is beautiful
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,it's very hot so do wear sunscreen but other than that it's an ok hot spring btw the water is very hot and u can cook eggs there ✨
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Best place for family to hang out but this park do not have car park so need park at neared HDB and walk 5min
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Singapore's only Hot Spring which is actually operating currently. Mostly Elderly and Children with Skin Conditions come here to get the hot spring water as they believe it is helpful in curing conditions and promotes blood circulation. You can bring some eggs to boil or just come to have a soak. Absolutely free of charge. Food can be purchased nearby at Chong Pang Market for convenience.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very nice park for a quick couple hour get away. Little shade so hats and an umbrella might be a good idea.
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Boring place. Walk all the way under hot sun here just to see a few pot of hot water...
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"A place to enjoy the hot spring without leaving singapore. The only thing that is not very convenient is, there is no carpark. Should have a carpark there so that the elder do not need to walk so far."
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Came from the East to visit the park early this morning but park was closed. Should have updated the site to inform all. Disappointed.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Fantastic place to soak your legs, or to cook your half boil eggs as water temperature reaches 70deg C. But afternoon sun is real  scorching hot. Too less planted trees. Crowded in the evenings and weekends. And remember to bring umbrellas."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Small park with hot spring, the only hot spring known in Singapore. Hot spring area for soaking feet is quite crowded so you could bring your own pail for soaking. There is an area for cooking onsen eggs as well. The place is clean."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,I like that there were different water temperatures so we can try it out... Am deciding to go once a month with my family now... Really a great experience
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Crowded and people didn't abide by safety distancing rules. too many kids as well .
Recommend to come during off- peak hours to enjoy the solitude and peaceful scenery.
Bring your own eggs to make poached egg"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"All the buckets are gone, everyone brings personal pail"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Small park look gd aft reno. Saline hot spring open from 7 to 7pm . There is small cafe for breakfast . Need parking. . Nearest cp is chong pang oppo db barrack
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"try to bring your own pails to the hot Spring source as there are only 6 seats, and always 10+ ppl in the queue - roughly 20-30 mins queue.

among the 6 seats (highlighted with yellow tapes due to covid 19), the 2 ""seats"" nearer to the heart source (of 70 degrees C) will be way hotter than the rest of the seats, so ideally, the 3rd seat from the hot stones will be the most optimal for your leg soaking session without cooking your legs like Shabu-Shabu

hot spring is closed from 7pm to 7am, a staff will start chasing people out at 645 because he needs to lock the place by 7pm
visited on 29-8-2020, Saturday"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Don’t miss this place must go this hot springs in Singapore next time when I can come back home to Java I will explore more
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Now there is no buckets to use.  Please remember to bring your own or loan one from the eatery nearby.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very kampung feel..not big of an area
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Open 7am to 7pm. Free of charge. Highly recommended!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Free hot spring foot bath.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,There's a cafe there to rent buckets from.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Visited in July 2020 (Phase 2 of safe nation). It's nice to have social distancing, therefore not as crowded as before. You MUST bring your own pail, because they no longer provided that nice wooden ones -- because people stand on it, break it, or brought it home :(

The maintenance uncle said he find it gross to use the common foot spa area. He cleans it twice a week. Better to use your own pail.

The whole area looks very nice."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place for footbath.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Well kept beautiful park, fun to try to cook eggs in the water at the Egg Cooking station! Water too hot to keep feet immersed at the footbath area though. Interesting information boards and tasty snacks at the cafe. Fun couple of hours"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"A beautiful park wif alot of beautiful flowers and  people, a small cafe, the big hot spring.."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Small, clean and well kept but limited seats and shade"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Free of charge for entrance
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Very crowded at 7am.
Seats, buckets, pails etc free for public to use.
Many bikers rest here for chit chat."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"It's free, no entry charge."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,great...
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"3 stars as this is written from the perspective of a mommy with young kids, non-resident in the nearby area (not to mention am probably guilty of being a helicopter parent). The level of enjoyment just doesn't worth the effort to lug the kids from other parts of the island to enjoy the hot spring. There's no nearby carpark, you are at the mercy of the elements (we did wonder why the whole hot spring area cannot be covered) and the hot spring is simply too small to cater to big groups of people. I think the place is designed with the nearby residents in mind. Also you have to brave the busy main intersection to access the park from the nearest HDB estate. Still the hot spring is a little gem in its own right."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,A lot more can be done to spruce up the park and harness the hotsprings. Currently just a basic tiered pool w limited seating and a few running taps at the egg cooking station.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,So good
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Beautifull first time ther ti just take phoyo but i put my hand in the boilling water almost burn mu hand a good experence will go again other day thks god
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Enjoy a nice and relax Sunday morning with my wife, we boiled and ate half boiled eggs, chit chat with people from all walks of life, the young and old people."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good. Wheelchair friendly.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"When driving to Sembawang Hot Spring, do take note that there's no public carpark at the location.  The car needs to be parked at the nearest HDB carpark in Yishun and walk over. The walk isn't so bad, it's around 300m - 500m walk.
The park is nice, with a little food outlet, vending machine and toilets. But it's pretty crowded over the weekends with most people either boiling eggs, dipping their feet to relax or sometimes soak totally in a tub they bring from home..
Overall, can a pretty nice place to walkabout a little and feel the heat from the water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good place. Crowded and as usual some selfish people. But great place
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Beautiful surrounding. Popular place for free hot foot bath.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The water was really hot, which is nice. You could borrow a bucket from the restaurant at the beginning. All in all a nice experience."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,First time visiting this only hot springs in Singapore. Very meaningful trip to go with my family!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Amazing place and free. water has sulphur smell. after one hour your skin will feel smooth. pails and chairs donated, recommended to bring your own in case place is crowded. the taps flow non stop with 85 degrees water. during the japanese occupation, this became a japanese onsen!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"A bit crowded. Hot, which is good and bad lol. Remember to bring own bucket and can try eggs boiling with thermoflask and spring water"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,I bring my own chair and own pail.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,A little crowded though but a great place for a family chillex. Remember not to leave your trash ya.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,We made a quick trip to this place after some time well spent at the nearby Admiralty Park playground. The kids loved seeing this natural phenomenon and were quite intrigued by the sulphuric smell and the fuming hot water! Im glad to see how the Government has developed this place and made it a picturesque site complete with food and washroom facilities. Dont forget to borrow a bucket from the restaurant to collect the hot spring’s water and dip your feet. Very relaxing!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Rather small park but nice. Can dip your legs in the hot water and relax and also rent buckets as well.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Still opened as of 18feb. The cement pavement and tap water area still remain untouch as of the picture. Some reno works around the area.
The water is very hot to touch with bare hands, do wait for some time to cooldown to wamer temperature.
Plently of pails and seats for public use.
Do note to bring your own plastic bags for trash and no toilet in vicinity. The closest is at chongpang."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Natural hot spring but it super crowded on morning. Do come on cooling time to enjoy. Bring your owned tong as the public tong was not enough or spoilt.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Singaporean style onsen (hotspring). Kampong feel... heard government has plan to develop this site. Thumbs up for preserving this place.
Note: Nearest carpark abt 600m away, Yishun HDB Blk 114.

Things to bring:
1) Pail/tub, at least 2. To tahlak the water to your desired temperature. (Depend on luck, you may find some shared one here)
2) Chair. (Depend on luck, you may find some shared one here)
2) Towel
3) Egg. If you feel like having some hard/soft boiled egg while enjoying your onsen."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"A hidden gem in Singapore, not known by many. A very good place for relaxing over the weekends. A few points to take note,
- No parking spot, just a small space for drop/ pick off. Nearest parking area will be the blocks around Chong Pang. Walking distance is 15- 20mins from there.
- Pails and chairs can be found there.
- Place is opened from 7am to 7pm."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Dropped by to enjoy the serenity of the park, with all the beautiful flowers and plants that were used to be so common during kampong days. Brought down memory lane especially for my parents. However, do note that the hot spring side of the park is always crowded with people anxiously trying their means to get the hot water. I even saw some people took the rock (can they even supposed to do that?) from the hot water while carrying it around. Yes I do see that the hot water is of a natural source but it seems some people treat it like its some kind of a super magical water for them.... Gosh..."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Wonderful place to have a little get away to soak your tired feet!! Just bring your own containers to soak your feet if it get too crowded. Big container to soak your feet small ones to cook your eggs!!!!! Bring a towel too...😀😀
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very small place just like Singapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Singapore's only Hot Spring Park !
Steep in history as you soak your feet in natural spring waters at this public park.
No Car Park, take a bus or cab and a leisurely stroll =)
Bring your own pails, there are no pails provided other than a communal pool which may see long queues on weekends.
Cafe offers pail rentals or purchases."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Went on a Sunday. There is a small cafe just at the entrance where you can rent a bucket if you came unprepared. Else, many visitors brought their own buckets, foldable chairs to enjoy soaking their feet. Remember to bring eggs too! Thr is a cooking station there for eggs..."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Hot Spring. Spotted this lovely White Bunga Telang at the garden walkway.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,It okay a good place to sight seeing however a lot of old ppl at the side using the water... recommended to bring your own pail if you want to dip your feet for detox.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,A few minutes walk from nearby carpark.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice and warm on a rainy day!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Great. It is free. Need to park at HDB & walk 15 min.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"A bit of a walk from the nearest carpark or bus stop, but worth the visit!
If it's your first time, remember to bring your own foot pail or scooper if you don't want to queue for the foot dipping pool. You can even bring eggs to soft boil at a dedicated 70°c tap, but be advised the wait is approximately 40 minutes.
There are also a limited number of sheltered seats, so check the weather before your visit or go in the later afternoon hours, an average visit is about one and a half to two hours long.
Otherwise, enjoy the flower and plant gardens at the entrance and take your time dipping your feet, it'll help to increase your blood flow!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place but too small the area. Plus no proper drop off and pick up area.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Accessable, serene,and a place for all races and all ages, must share with someone."
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,"Poor design of cascading hot spring pond, so shallow and only few seats for soaking legs. Water very dirty n not flowing. Waste taxpayers 's money on the poor design. No brain design."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,A very interesting park. 1km walk from the nearest carpark
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The best and the only hot spring in Singapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Well done NParks to rebuild the whole facility for better use to residents. Note I think the ""Caution"" signs in the pools can be bigger or fonts larger. Many asking me in public how travel there? Here attach my map. Hope to clarify. There's no buses to the hot spring. Must alight at the bus stops besides the army camp in Yishun Chong Pang. Don't expect to take a taxi as driver won't stop at the park entrance. Must walk from bus stops to the hot spring. Bus numbers are 167, 856, 858, 859, 969 and 980 usual buses."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Fantastic therapy for my knees. Yet to bring my tub. Water is so hot. That you need to have a bucket and smaller bucket to teh tarik one way to cool water. Bring containers to collect water n bring home for your love ones.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Pleasant community gowhere, a good place to chill with family"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very rare nature giving to have such natural hot spring in such a small island nation. It is neatly maintained for public recreational use.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Too damn hot. Go in the early mornings
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Mum & aunt had a good time soaking their feet
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very crowded on a public holiday. But still enjoyed the experience of dipping feet into the hot water
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,If have better places to go.. Don't come this place.. Badly design waste of tax payer money.. Nothing much difference from b4 renovation beside more flowers... Singapore gov and npark please wake up.. Money not burn like this
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Free local hot spring
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,It's currently closed for revamp. However there taps located outside the perimeter fence so you still can get some onsen eggs done. They will be back late next year. The pokestops / portals sembawang hotsprings and laughing Buddha mini shrine cannot be reached for now. Only yishun sembawang heritage trial can be reached if you walk into the slip road to the right of the original hot spring gates.
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,"Those irresponsible half naked Users fill up their portable bathing pool and bathing in open public view then pour them all onto the slippery floor.

No one bother to wash their pail before scooping another round of hot spring water and contaminating the pool.

Dun expect to be very hygiene as it’s public users with different hygiene standards.

Otherwise go overseas and pay for private clean onsen."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place to soak your tiring feet in hot spring water and most important it is free 😊
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Should have more bigger and more hot spring,let us to have metal pot to cook egg like army type pot."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Bring your own pail, towels and scoop"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Waa surprise surprise. Great place, didn't know this existed so near home."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Could have done with more shelters..  but nice to have a hot spring to soak your tired feet.  I guess many visitors live nearby..
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Crowded af. Seems like the hot water can kill the virus as safe distancing ain’t happening here!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good place to hang out..
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"See news got wooden bucket for public use, but I dun see any of it...."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"First time visiting. Great place done up to accomodate people. Separate stations for those who want to soak feet, collect water and cook eggs.

Only thing some people are irresponsible and seem uneducated to follow guidelines and to maintain proper etiquette while using the facilities. Some are using the pool area to cook eggs and to the extent the eggs crack and pollute the pool.

Best to avoid peak hours/periods."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,A nice place to visit. It is free. Bring your pail if u do not want to share with others. There is pail rental if u need. The cental area should build a shade instead. Bring a mini pool for the kid is good idea.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Well defined space! Interesting experience.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very interesting to have a natural hot spring ♨ in tropical Singapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place for a hot water dip.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Haven't been there before ..today just went nearby and realized. Umm.. will die die go there someday.. serious will go then write another review. Heard my friend said very relaxing.. final review akan datang..
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Not enough shades,n place to sit. Too crowded"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Most people are regulars, mostly seniors. They will point out to hot spring virgins like us the different temperatures to your liking. Ask around for the not-so-hot sources, the hot sources need sometime to cool down before you can dip in.  Bring sunblock if you intend to stick around longer."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Coming here first time and really impressed, the kids enjoyed it so much!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice garden... close to nature. A place to chill and wind down....
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The place quite small so need to queue up.  V hot tho,  went on sun Morn 9am and a lot ppl"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,I’m really glad Singapore has this Hot Spring Park. While we are named the most expensive city in world - there are many places of interest that are free to visit. You just need to know where they are hidden. Let me know know what you think about the place too. 🥰👍 #SingaporePlacesofInterest #TrulySingapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Had a great experience there. If you do not want to bring your own bucket, you can rest one for 1.50 - 2.50 for 90mins with $5 deposit for each bucket"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Fascinating that there is a hot spring right smack in sembawang! You will notice regulars with their buckets collecting the abundance of hot spring water.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"First timing coming here after a friend reco, worth it! but be careful there are certain pool where the water is boiling hot~~"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"This place is a bit crowded during the late afternoon probably is because it is cooler. With the social distancing measures, you need to queue to dip your feet in the water. So it is highly suggested to bring your own water bucket for dipping. It is unfortunate that some folks ""soak their feet forever"" and disregard those queuing up behind. As for the ""onsen eggs"" you need patience to get it ""right"". Most of the folks let it soak in hot running spring waters. The spring water has sulphuric smell. Is really hot. It amazing to experience hot spring in Singapore. Check out the photo. Somehow the eggs tasted a bit salty, but still tasty. The egg white still very soft and watery, while the egg-york firm. Just slurp in one go!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,"too many ppl,the soak leg area dint set a time,all those ""kia shu ""1 dont leave the space for ages,i saw some prc and a couple sit there over 30min also dont get up even long que,then we saw an empty space finally  just sit down about 3 min the npark lady come and ask us get up say social distance(i understand this periond we need to,but why chase those just came one and not those who use the space so long one ,she just anyhow pick ppl then those sit for long 1 still dont get up,are they a vip there??,!!!),then the boil egg area also ,an auntie take a few super big container and keep standing there and get the water other ppl dont get a chance to try ,so so dissapointed,all the way from pasir ris to sembawang just to experience this🙄"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,For knee and ankle pain must try.Do it for 30 min. you will feel the difference.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,For me hot spring is very strange.IMHO need to improve  this beautiful place
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Quite organised and family friendly. Although I personally think that it would be better with more shades.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place to visit for weekend
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Beautiful place ever since it got revamped. Though it's very crowded on the weekend do bring along your own bucket as it will be hard to get hold of the communal bucket on the weekends.

Also there isn't a parking space in the compound, you'll have to park at the nearest hdb blocks and make a 5 minutes walk to the spring."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The water is really hot... Although the place is undergoing renovation, but can still access the hot water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good place for family and friends  to go.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great for family bonding and with health issues
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice organised location and sitting/resting area.

The down side is no carpark nearby. Nearest carpark is about 300m away. No actual shelter for rainy days too.

Bring your own water pail/container to soak your tired feet, as the waiting time at the foot bath could be up to 30mins on a weekday.

Bring some eggs to cook at the hotspring for the kids.

Water temperature is about 70 to 45 degrees."
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,"A small park with a small hot springs, limited space for seating, very hot water and weather, limited shaded area around the park. It's just too hot to withstand the weather and the water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,The one and only natural hotspring in SG. Don't expect naturally forming pond though. But the restaurant food is excellent for it's price.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Bring your own bucket seems to be the trend
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Funny place to go in Singapore ! Do not forget your bucket if you want longer treatment! Water is so hot.. what a pity that it’s never snowing in Singapore...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Water very hot
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Unique place in Singapore as you hardly get hotspring here. Well renovated, with tubs and pails for soaking your feet if you are not comfortable with the main area where everyone soaks their feet in.

There is a separate tap for get the water for cooking your eggs which is quite well thought.

The lack of parking area is a little troublesome for old folks or handicapped community, a small driveway for dropoff would be great."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great place. One of a kind in Singapore. Free entry.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The one and only in S'pore. Too bad no toilet there, make sure you finish your business before going there."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nearest parking is Block 114 and Block 115A HDB then have to cross. Walk along Gambas, don't turn on the first left after bus stop. Prepare to walk about 10 min from parking. Bring your own pail and bucket"
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Too crowded Covid19 pro active area
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Its a good place to visit.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Newly opened after renovations, this place is a gem in the north. There is now a floral walk, cascading pool and cafe! You can soak your feet by the cascading pool where the hot spring water flows down from the top. The park also provides buckets and ladles which you can use to soak your feet if you cannot find a space by the pool. You can also bring eggs and cook it in the smaller buckets - just be sure to place them under running hot water."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"This is the only hot spring that we have in our nation.it should be widened & constructed more spaces for tourists & people to utilize this facilities.It seems like too crowded with too many people in this premises, especially during the weekends many old & young residents walk into the hot spring to relax in themselves with less benches & shelters from shading under the hot sunny days."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great enjoyable and relaxing place
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"It is a somewhat small park with a unique feature, the hot springs. Surroundings are quiet as it's it's mostly surrounded by a military camp. There is a nice variety of flora for its size. It is also considered a regular park so you can bring your dog in for a look/sniff. I didn't see any signs forbidding the soaking of your dog in the hot springs. However, I doubt it is polite to let it do so.

Although the opening time is 7am, you will be able to enter slightly earlier. In my opinion, the cooler weather, soft lighting of dawn/moon light and the general peacefulness before 7am, make it the best time to enjoy the hot
springs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"This place is a bit off the beaten track to get to, but it is worth a visit. The gardens around the park have an array of different plants and flowers. The pool itself is small, but there are plenty of wooden buckets around if you want to spend some time soaking your feet. There is even a station to draw water if you want to cook some eggs."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"The experience at Sembwang Hot Spring was cathartic. Great place to rejuvenate tired souls, especially does with sore feet. There are communal pails for sharing. But best would be to bring your own personal pails for hygiene reasons. Bring a tiny one for scooping.

Just be mindful that there isn't any parking at the hot spring. Nearest parking option is most probably at the nearby HDB flats."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,There are pails for rent at the cafe. Nparks has removed the free wooden ladles and buckets for public use.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The hot spring is the only one in Singapore . After rebuilding the area with a small beautiful stream and nature park . The place seem to be thriving with birds.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Must bring your own bucket...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Didn't bring eggs to cook... Would be give star if taste is exceptional!!! 😋
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,"Need to improves
Surrounding."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,One of the hot spring in Singapore. Recently open to public and NPark beautify it with plants and flowers.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very hip place to visit for a hot soak outdoor.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,It wld b nice to hv some trees to provide shades
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Cosy but the water is approx 70 Celsius.. bit hot
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice place good for family outing. Bring a pail along
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Natural hot water! The only one in Singapore...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,nice place to visit but please let us have a carpark or at least a proper drop off point!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,nice hot spring and good place for stroll
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The one and only hot spring in SG
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Clean and nicely built park. It is a small park, the main attraction is the hot spring."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The current place is soooo much better than before, much more accessible, cleaner and family friendly.

There are proper marked and designated areas for the amenities and facilities, clear instructions on the etiquette etc."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place to spend time.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,Closed 8 - 30 May...
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Relax and enjoy the hot water
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Weekdays are Good to Go, not crowded.
Weekends can be tedious, bcoz no parking facility & it is crowded."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Overcrowd during sat & sunday.Water pails with eggs are used to occupy the water pipes every where.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Good water but very limited shelters very warm la
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Clean and well taken care off. Hotspring water is between 45degrees to 70degrees.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,"A very quiet and peaceful place to visit (depending on what time you visit the park). It is normally crowded with elderly exercising in the morning. I've been there once (as I live 5 mins away) since the opening of the hotspring to see what all the hype is about since there is a hot spring.

I was quite disappointed as the park was smaller than I expected, but i would say it is clean and quite refreshing. My friend and I prepared to cook some eggs but it was not cooked even after putting the egg in the hot water for some time. What a nice way to waste an egg! HAHAHA It is nice for a one-time visit just to see what all the hype (on social media) is about but I personally would not visit it again.

I also do not see the benefits of putting my feet inside the hot spring with twenty or thirty other people. Maybe this place is just not for me.

Tip: There is no direct bus/ bus stop, but you can alight at the bus stop (bus 965) near Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School, walk straight, cross the traffic light, walk a little more and you will reach your destination."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,No car park here. Only can drop off. Park at nearby 5 mins walk from HDB Yishun Block 114 or 10 mins walk from Chong Pang market.  Bring your own pair as have limit seat pool side.  With your own pair you can find a shaded area to sit down.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Often crowded. The queue always long, should bring or rent the tub from the coffee shop."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Ok good..
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Must visit
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Nice bring own pot, egg cooking"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,very nice park with hotspring foot bath. area feels cooler than an air conditioned room at the park area. hotspring area had pails tubs and buckets for the public to use. you'll need to bring towel to dry your feet and slippers to change into since it quite a long walk from the bus stops near by.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very crowded during weekend.. best to go during weekday...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Natural hotsprings and therapy for your legs. Salt Rich hot water
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Cool place to bring your fam along to cook onsen eggs using the natural hot spring water. Saw people bring their own black soya sauce and pepper to enjoy the eggs.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"only 3 stars as the place was not friendly to family with babies or family with elderly where the elderly have problems walking long distances and/or climbing.

not enough shelters and no loading and unloading places as it is next to the camp.

the place easily attracts 100 over people but the place maybe only good enough for 30 to 50 people."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Great natural outdoors.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Definitely need to boil longer than 15 minutes.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Rem bring uncoooked egg
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"It's peaceful, nice and quiet.."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Bring ur own bucket!!
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Very hot place, insufficient shelter and very inconvenient location."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Too hot
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,Too much people in the hot spring and doesn't have social distance.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,So many flowers at entrance and walk way. Got public toilet there and can bring eggs to cook. To eat.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Airy n beautiful
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Cosy garden, relaxing. Also with toilet and a cafe!"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,😃
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Too crowded and some people skin problems also go, not hygeine"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the mess the kids created. It is supposed to be a footh bath not a swimming pool. They threw the hotspring water out of it. Such a waste. Dirty feet all over. Some kids had diapers on. One was naked. There is no control. The shelters were also insufficient. For today got tents but once removed only left with 3 shelters which does not really ward off the rain. Wonder how long the foot bath will last if every weekend is like that.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Unique. Great for the family
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice to have a hot spring in Singapore..... Takes a bit of effort but worth the walk. Nearest car park is about 400m away.
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,No parking for motor and car...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Getting crowded. More benches and shelters.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Super Super crowded now, after the renovations so I'm a little waery of recommending this place to everyone. But, I suppose when the hype really dies down and its less packed with very unruly people, it could possibly be a place to relax and wind up with the family."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"Hotspring water endless flow
...rare experience in Singapore"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"My previous review was lost: It was the last day before the place was closed for redevelopment. The environment was raw and rustic, crowded with community mostly living nearby bringing their own plastic pails, buckets and even bath tubs. One woman was washing clothes and others were sneering at her. Another woman was giving out home-made curry puffs, and eagerly chatting with everyone as if the place would be closed for good. Such was the kampung-like scene.

NParks and the designer (who?) did a great job in redeveloping the place, making it more family friendly. Existing trees were kept, even the small building that houses the well was renovated; the entrance path was landscaped, and the entire place much more lush and conducive. Wonder if the old local community are back and happy?"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Hot weather. Hot water. Very crowded. There is a small cafe selling local food.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Very good experience.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Many wanted to go there especially the senior citizen & ppl with disability unfortunately there's no parking lot provided
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,NOTHING BET NATURE CREATION. Real medic to my foot.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,Cloudy water at the common pool. Not enough bucket to cater to the crowd and some buckets are broken. No parking available.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Lack of shelter and the pond for soaking can be bigger.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The only in singapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Only place in Singapore with a hot spring.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,Generally okay place to enjoy some hot water and hot springs - it is properly utilised.  Unfortunately the place is rather hot and there is not much shade so bring a cap or an umbrella
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Beautiful place
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Was just outside as it was part of the round island route walk of 155km
We had a night walk & couldn't go in. Will be back next trip"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,To soak your tired feet and relax with the hot spring water
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Fantastic stress reliever
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,epic eggy smell
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Place to Feel the power of nature and  have a foot hot spa to heal your leg pains 😊
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Very nice
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Visited the new, renovated park. Really beautiful park and I think the renovation was excellent.

There are pools where you can soak your feet in the warm spring water. (For first timers, slowly put your feet into the water, instead of directly dipping your whole feet in at once)

You can also bring eggs to cook at the egg cooking station, just remember to bring your own container.

There's also an open lawn, toilets, and a café there.

Overall, great place to visit and relax. Best time to go is in the morning from 7-9am, or in the evening after 4pm."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,OK good
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Not easy to locate this hot spring as the signboard was removed. There was no indication that the main gate beside the fenced up camp area is the entrance footpath to the Sembawang Hot Spring. There was a notice beside the gate informing the public that there is no lighting in this park area. Anyway, we managed to find it after walking up & down along the fence twice. After entering the main gate, walked along the footpath to the Hot Spring. There was a signboard at the end of the footpath. The hot spring was quiet and gave us a peaceful feeling.  The spring water was very hot. The water temperature at the central area was about 80 degree C and can easily cook eggs. So be extremely careful when soaking your feet. The spring water at the side area was about 40 degree C. Still abit hot for soaking feet, requiring some cooling before we soaked our feet. The caretaker was kind to open the gate of red brick building because it was about to rain. There was a water pump and a hot spring well in the building. I was told the pump delivered hot spring water to all the taps in the open areas. We soaked our feet, we can feel the increase of blood circulating to our feet. Nice comforting feeling. Great place to visit but have to be cautious as the floor (around the taps) was very slippery (especially wet algae area). Enjoyed a free relaxing feet spa. 👍👍👍👍"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Beautiful 😍
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Good design. More shades should be erected along the perimeters where the seating logs are located.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Ate half boiled egg the old way without any cutlery.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The only hot spring in Singapore that I know of, unbeatable."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Family spot
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"How not to enjoy SG own natural hot spring? Too bad it's not as a Japanese style onsen for a whole body soak. Still glad it's free to use. However lots of people are not practicing hygiene and basic onsen rules. 40deg pool is very dirty. Kids splash those water everywhere or putting these to 50 Deg pool, it's disgusting. Elderly are also seen soaking full body in the 40 Deg pool."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Awesome place...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Singapore's only natural hot spring. It's open to public at certain hours and you can use the hot spring to boil eggs or soak your feet in publicly usable pails. No entrance fees.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Sembawang/ Gambas Hot Spring
The one and only hot spring in Singapore. Mostly extract elderly. Water here really hot.

Last update Sep2017"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Cool place but is hot
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,"The cascading pool, the overall infrastructure is an improvement from the previous. But this landscaping renovation had a major flaw! Many tall trees were chopped off for whatever reason? Last time was more cooling and have canopy, the renovated park now is very warm on a hot weather with only 3 small shelters, the only tallest trees to block off the sunlight in the morning has limited space if is on a crowded day. The 3 shelters are too small to accommodate more people. The wooden pails on day 2 opening are already damaged and not enough to go around as it is too crowded. People choking up the hot water tap point to boil their eggs under the running boiling water. Improvement is in a good way but more bad points surface out. Is good experience but way too crowded for now"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Fun place to soak your feet in smelly hot water. Recommend for a date. He/she will definitely smell like some delicious rotten eggs after the date.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Enjoy the hot spring washing the leg.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Free
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Love this place!!!! The cafe there looks good!!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,The bathing egg in the hot spring.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice and clean. Very well design.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nature at its best!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Its a nice and natural hot spring place to visit and experience....Wooden basin were provided for the visitor to soak the feet(the effectiveness of water quite good).Im just disappointed with some visitor that boiled the egg inside the basin and leave it unattended.This stopping others to use the basin and its more to hygien matter.Further more,there are some peoples bring the socks and wash it...Hopes peoples will take care of the place for everyomes goodness.The hot spring guard should provided with a loud speaker to make announcement so its will be more clear and easy for everyones."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Natural hot spring located in Sembawang,Singapore. Easily reachable through bus from Yishun MRT. Alight at bus stop Opposit blk 115B. Its just 100-200m from here though on google map, distance is apoearing more than we km.Since its  natural hot spring it  has certain healing properties."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place in a city like Singapore
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Open  at 7.00 am
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Water is hot.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Went on weekday 11am-ish and there's already a sizeable crowd.
Overall it's quite a small place but it's cosy and surrounded with lush greenery.
The water from the cascading pools have different temperatures so it depends on how heat-sensitive you are.
There are buckets and ladles available to dip your feet or cook eggs, but please be considerate and wash them before returning.
Hope everyone can exercise proper hot spring etiquettes and not take free things for granted."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,the hot spring was a little to cold even it was 45 degrees on this lovely sunday afternoon. Anyways i would always prefer petting the giraffes! ..Also throwing away your garbage was not allowed so 3/5.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The only hot spring found in Singapore.  There are 3 spring water points.  Centre outlet is the hotest.  Need not bring any pail or containers as there are quite a number of them there for your use. Simply love it.
Sembawang Hot Spring,2,"Very crowded ! Should build bigger, is a good place for singaporean to relax"
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,Spring over crowded.. place 5mins can walk finish.. waste time.. total waste of taxpayers money.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"A must-go for all Singaporeans, young and old! The only active hot spring in Singapore. Enough said."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Very shocked to see a hot spring in Singapore! This place is open for public free.
It's not like the hot spring you see in Japan, the hot spring here is in piping no pool. Many local will bring their own pail to soak their feet."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"You expect to see a natural spring with water flowing freely but once you reach there, the water is extracted using taps. You're supposed to fill the water in the buckets available and sit in the seating areas.
The water is naturally very hot and you can smell Sulphur.

I was disappointed because i thought there would be a stream flowing, only to find the natueally heated water coming through taps"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Nparks should have done more to make more shelters for the sitting areaa & provide a larger cafe. Even the main area could have been given a large umbrella-type shelter
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Free hot spring water, one and only one in Singapore. The other hot spring outlet is off limits from the public."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,I think they need to improved. What i see there is no proper place to have our feet to soak in the hot spring. May be they could make a few bath tub. seperately so that we can take  sauna. Toilet for shower & changing room. I ever been to hotspring at Malacca  Gadek hotspring. There is a stall or restaurant  and big screen for entertaiment or tv programme.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,U need to bring a pail
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Like it great little spot for a little fun
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The water was quite hot but once you dip your feet in you won't regret. Get there before this one also gets commercialized and perhaps ticketed
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Free admission, relax, natural unlimited hot spring water flowing out from tap. Just bring a tower or few egg to cook. ^-^"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Don't expect too much!
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Free entrance. Good for cook half boiled egg and foot spa. Self bring the bucket.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"Erase all your spa fantasies - there's nothing fancy about the natural hot spring water here. Then again, there's no price for helping yourself to any of it, either. BYOB (bucket) if you like."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,A good place to have your legs soak in hot spring water. Bring some tumbler can last high temperature water and can bring natural mineral water back to drink.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"It is a place for local wanting to have a relax and soaking of their legs on some natural hot spring water. Other then it, there are not much facilities and views here as it is encompass by army camps around it."
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,It is a nice place to go. Bring eggs there to enjoy a meal.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Awesome experience...
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good place to rejuvenate.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Nice environment. Free for public.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Interesting place. But many buckets are broken and leaking.
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,It's kind a difficult to locate the place and I think they were under development when we visited this place. Otherwise it's a good place to relax.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Natural hot spring
Sembawang Hot Spring,1,"On a world scale this is one of the most disappointing hot springs. You can’t dip in like a pool, it’s just a few taps with people doing cooking and using buckets to clean their feet. A complete joke of a place. - try press google images hot springs and you’ll see what it should be like around the world."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Natural hot spring in a surrounded area. It has 3 cluster of pipes to channel the hot spring water for easier usage. Chairs and pails could be shared at the location but you should bring along your towel to drape your body and legs after soaking the total in the hot spring water. Best to go early in the morning or later in the evening (not night)
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Nice place😘

Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Hot Springs
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,The only one hot spring in Singapore. You can do your DIY hot water legs spa there. There are container and pails donated by public.  First come first serve. User and visitors are very friendly!
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"One of the 2 natural hot spring in singapore. The other is closed to public.

Going to be redeveloped, but current setup is decent enough.

Boil an egg, soak your feet, or just show your kids the natural phenomenom.

There is no toilet and parking nearby so plan ahead."
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,nice place but sad that our gov. dont do much...maybe more of a residential place where ppl go not to much for visitors...
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,Great place for family gathering. Remember to bring plastic hairs and pails. Also don't forget the parasols.

Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Good place for relaxation! Can spent upto one/two Hours! No need to bring backets can get it there upon request :)
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"Its Singapore only hot spring! This hot spring is used by F&N in the pre-war era for bottled hot spring water named ""Seletaris"". The condo across the road shared the same name and guess who is the developer?"
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,It's an ok hot spring.
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Upgrade from last time I visited after 20year's ago
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Hope that our next generation will be able to see this place!

Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"This is the new Sembawang Hot Spring . A park like , spa like place now !

My previous review 2 years ago are badly irrelevant now.

Will review again if I can go there . ( Now Covid in the air )

Still, if you like to know something of the old Sembawang Hot Spring ( 2 years ago ), read on.

2 years ago , …

The one and only Sembawang Hotspring !
In modern urbanised Singapore , a natural hot spring, who would have thought ?

Disclaimer : if you are expecting to see a scenic pool of hot spring water with great view and geysers gushing out more water periodically , you will be disappointed.

In reality , it is more like 2 tiled washing areas , each with a pipe that flows out hot spring water.

The water that gushes out from the pipe are real . It is bona fide hot spring water . ( It was laboratory tested way back in the 1920s by the locals...)
It has a long history . It was a real hot spring pool in those days though. Older folks in their 70s and 80s has memories of this hot spring . My father has fond memories of immersing and relaxing in the hot spring pool in his younger days , around 1950s  .  Later it was filled as the land is needed and the water pipes and pump station are built in its place.

The water from the spring is scalding hot. It is hot enough to boil eggs and cook meat.
It is not advisable to drink the water as it is heavy with sulfur.

Some tried filling containers of the water and soak their feet in it. They say it has therapeutic effects.

Please don't . It had been reported in the papers that some people had their legs becoming swollen and afflicted with serious medical conditions. The doctors  warned in the papers that the high mineral contents are not a cure and should not engage in those practices. But , still … there are those who ignored the warnings and continued .

So , if you are looking to see a hot spring that doesn't look like a hot spring , this is it !"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,One last SG natural spring. Good for family outing and gathering
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,Enjoy your life is a place for hot spring water for your good health blessings with God in Singapore hot spring.
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,"The Sembawang Hot Spring is found near the junction of Sembawang Road and Gambas Avenue, along Jalan Ulu Sembawang. A deserted brick house believed to be part of a former bottled drink factory marks the site.

The spring is currently on Sembawang Air Base grounds, but is open to the public from 7am to 7pm.

The spring water is said to cure rheumatism, and heal skin problems such as acne or psoriasis. Doctors said there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. However, the heat of the water can relax muscles and joints."

Sembawang Hot Spring,5,A relaxing afternoon there. The water is really hot and refreshing
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"The one and only hot spring in Sg. 😖 Sigh, you'd think we'd have kept more of these natural wonders, rather than consider them a nuisance to development and plug them up.  I saw people bringing their own little tubs to have an impromptu ""onsen"" of sorts, for skin problems. OTHER SITES: I saw one that fed into a drain in the lane just behind Upper Serangoon Shopping Center.  I think its been plugged up since- taxi drivers used to wash their cabs there.  There's also some near the polo club / mosque vicinity in Thomson, I think."
Sembawang Hot Spring,3,Crowded.

Sembawang Hot Spring,1,"Visited the park on Friday, Sep 3 2021. It is closed but the website states it is open. What a disappointment. Somebody in charge is sleeping on the job, not updating the website status. 😒"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"(Translated by Google) For the recent coronavirus outbreak! It's a good place to open up small crowds to soak their feet in the near future!

(Original)
为了最近冠病的引响！而开放小人群去泡脚不久的将来会更热闹是个好地方！"
Sembawang Hot Spring,5,"(Translated by Google) 1 It is recommended to bring a footbath bucket and a small bucket for eggs. It is also recommended to bring raw eggs or quail eggs. It’s better if you bring a folding bath tub!
If you don’t bring a footbath, and you sit by the pool to soak your feet, you may be too close to other people, or there is no place to sit! It is recommended that there be no more than 8 people at a time. So it is difficult to wait for a vacancy. If there is an ""X"" sign on the seat, people are not allowed to sit! You can soak your feet anytime you have a bucket without waiting for the position!
2 It is recommended to bring a cloak or jacket. Usually, your clothes and pants will get wet after soaking your feet or visiting. It is easy to catch a cold or bellyache when the wind blows back home! Towels must be brought!
3 Bring some water to avoid thirsty!
4 Bring a pair of slippers,
5 Good sun protection! Bring an umbrella!
6 The place is not big, the tour is over in ten minutes! Don't come in a hurry! It must be calm down and enjoy slowly!
7 It is recommended to bring two more masks, as you will sweat when you soak your feet, and the masks will get wet!
8 It is not easy for the elderly to soak for too long! Replenish moisture in the right amount!
※※※supplement:
On Mother's Day on May 9, 2021, some families went sightseeing and found that the government has closed this place. Please pay attention! Don't run in vain! ! !

1 建议带泡脚桶和放鸡蛋的小桶，也建议带上生鸡蛋或鹌鹑蛋。如果带上折叠的泡澡桶更好！
如果不带泡脚桶，坐到池边泡脚，有可能与其它人靠太近，或没位坐！因建议一次最好不超过8人。所以很难等到空位。如果坐位上有“X”标志，是不允许坐人的！有了桶什么时候都可泡脚而不必等位置！
2 建以带件披风或外套之类，往往泡脚或游览后基本上衣裤会湿，回家时风一吹很易着凉或肚痛！毛巾肯定要带上！
3 带点饮水，以免口渴！
4 带双拖鞋，
5 防晒要做好！带上伞！
6 地方不大，十分钟就参观完了！赶时间的不要来！一定是静下心来慢慢享受！
7 建议多带二个口罩，泡脚时出汗，易弄湿口罩！
8 老人不易泡太久！要适量补充水分！

2021年5月9日母亲节，一些家庭去观光，发现政府已关闭此处，请大家留意！不要白跑一趟！！！"
Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"(Translated by Google) Sembawang Nature Hot Spring Park, the bottom layer, the water temperature is 40 degrees, which is very suitable for soaking feet. But pay attention: there are also up to 70 degrees, which can be used to scald eggs or bird eggs. On the other side, the scalding area, the time is about 30 minutes or more, because even if they are scalded for more than an hour, they cannot be cooked until cooked. , Be careful of hot hands👆. On the foot soaking side, the highest layer is 70 degrees, and then each layer down is 60, 50, 45, and the lowest layer is 40 degrees. You can sit down and soak your feet comfortably.

Sembawang Hot Spring,4,"(Translated by Google) Unless you lived, you wouldn't even know it existed, let alone come. It is the only natural hot spring in Singapore.

It's a long way from the center of the city, but it's close to my house so I came here. Even though it is a hot spring, there is only a footbath facility. Everyone puts on a parasol while bathing in the sunshine just below the equator, and now they wear masks and enjoy footbaths, but it was crowded from daytime on weekdays. The population density was pretty good, but did you think that the relaxed atmosphere of enjoying the hot springs as you wish while keeping a proper sense of distance should be like Singapore?

This person, who came to the star, never entered the bathtub except when traveling, so it was comfortable enough to take a footbath.

I happened to be absent, but there is also a cafe where you can eat drinks and light meals.

街の中心からはだいぶ離れたとこですが、ウチからは近いので来てみました。温泉と言っても足湯の施設があるのみです。赤道直下の日差しを浴びながら、みんな日傘をさし、なんなら今はマスクを着用して足湯を楽しむわけですが、平日の昼間から賑わっておりました。まあまあの人口密度だったのですが、みんな適度の距離感を取りつつ、思い思いに温泉を楽しんでる緩い空気感がシンガポールっぽくてよいなぁ、と思いました？

来星してこのかた、旅行の時以外に湯船に入ることがないので、足湯でも十分に気持ちよかったですね。

たまたまお休みで行けなかったですが、飲み物や軽食を食べれるカフェも併設されてます。"

Warm reminder: It is not advisable to soak in the hot spring for too long, 15 or 20 minutes is more appropriate, especially if the elderly take a long time to soak their feet, it will cause sweating, palpitation and other symptoms. Diabetic patients with concurrent blood vessels, heart disease and heart failure , People with low blood pressure and often dizzy should not use too hot water to soak their feet or stay in the hot spring for a long time. People with severe eczema, dermatitis and rotten skin wounds should not try to go to the hot spring. Girls who have menstruation or pregnancy should also try Go to the hot spring, and remember to remove the metal jewelry from your body, otherwise you will find that the jewelry soaked in the hot spring has been vulcanized to black! Although there are free wooden barrels for everyone to use in the park, I still feel that Bring a small basin to install the blister feet, which is relatively sanitary, safe and clean.
The top layer of the hot spring pool is specially used to soak eggs for the masses. You must take the foot bath water on the bottom layer first, and the second layer can be used. The elderly must lift their feet into the warm pool, and it is best to have young people around them to help them. In order to avoid accidental falls, you must first determine whether the heat of the water temperature can adapt. The water temperature in the lower layer is 40 degrees, and the upper layer should be about 70 degrees.
When entering the park, you can use the hot springs to soak your feet. All the wooden buckets provided by the park are free of charge, but please remember to put the buckets back in place after use, so that others can use them.

温馨提醒:泡温泉不宜泡太久，15、20分钟是比较恰当的，尤其是老年人泡脚时间过长的话会引起出汗心慌等症状，有血管并发的症糖尿病患者，心脏病心功能不全，低血压经常头晕的人都不宜用太热的水泡脚或长时间泡温泉，有严重湿疹皮肤炎与皮肤有腐烂伤口者，也尽量不要去泡温泉，女孩有来月经者或怀孕也尽量不要去泡温泉，还有记得把身上的金属饰品摘下来，不然你会发现被温泉水泡过的首饰，已经被硫化成黑色的!虽然公园有免费提供木桶给大家使用來泡脚，但还是觉得自己带个小盆子去装水泡脚，比较卫生安全干净。
温泉池最上面那一层是专门给群众泡鸡蛋用的,要拿泡脚水在底层第一，第二层都可以，年老者要抬脚进入温池中，身边最好有年轻人扶住以免不小心摔倒，还有要先确定水温的热度能否适应，下层水温都是在40度，最上一层应该有70度左右.
进入公园使用温泉泡脚，使用公园提供的木质水桶全部都是免费的，但请大家用完后确记把木桶放回原位，让其他人可以使用。还有……泡完脚后回家一定要用清水把脚洗干净， 或冲个凉😊喜欢这个视频给个赞呗!👍

HarbourFront Centre,5,"Despite Harbourfront being around for decades, it doesn't show its age. However the place is quite dull compared to VivoCity and if not for Cruise Centre and Don Don Donki, Harbourfront would be practically empty. I guess the crowd comes from the offices during weekdays."
HarbourFront Centre,5,"Harbor plus shopping area which visited by many tourist.
This place is big, clean, well managed"
HarbourFront Centre,5,"Most popular harbour, its busy at weekand"
HarbourFront Centre,5,Mall adjacent to Vivo with cheaper parking but a decent selection of stalls nonetheless.

HarbourFront Centre,5,"One of my favourite places to just travel to and watch the seaside view from the observatory in harbourfront centre. The view overlooks harbourfront jetty as well as Sentosa. If bored of sitting, you could take a short walk from harbourfront centre to Sentosa while enjoying the weather. Great place to just chill and stay away from all the rush and hectic times. Harbourfront centre is also a port enabling people to travel to and fro Indonesia via ferries. Used to be busy during pre-covid days but now is very quiet due to lack of ferrying activities."
HarbourFront Centre,4,A very huge facility. A lot of things under one roof. My favourite spot was the cruise viewing point. Loved watching the big cruises and ferries docking.
HarbourFront Centre,4,"It's a bit old, bit connects directly to VivoCity which is newer and up to date. They do have some great stores in HarbourFront and that's where you can board the ferry as well. Overall it's not bad."
HarbourFront Centre,5,"People this is a mall with class and style.
All your needs are available and the staffs there very helpful with whatever you want to buy.
Bought some dresses for the MRS and kids they were just lovely."
HarbourFront Centre,5,"One of the best Best Denki store in the country. Go in, talk to the sales and more often than not you'll walk away with a good deal, if not great deals. Don't buy online until you've checked in with them."
HarbourFront Centre,5,With the introduce of don don donki i foresee this mall will not be as quiet as before. 1 of my best selection for shopping without massive crowd. A great selection of food at the top floor too. Setting off to batam or bintan also quite a great place to board ship from. Hope covid is off soon and we can go for our much deserved trip eventually.
HarbourFront Centre,5,Good place.
HarbourFront Centre,5,The place connects you to the most exciting places in Singapore! It is also main avenue entry to harbour side of the country. While visiting Sentosa islands you travel through HarbourFront.

HarbourFront Centre,4,Don donki packed food reasonable 👌
HarbourFront Centre,5,"Harbour Front Centre (HFC) houses the Ferry Terminal that serves southern-islands-going travellers and also Batam Island. However, travellers hoping to go to the Indonesian island have to wait a while longer as the border is currently closed.

Nevertheless, the HFC is an attraction itself; notwithstanding its more glamorous neighbour — VivoCity. With tens of retail outlets — such as Cold Storage, Raffles Medical, Vivian & Sean, and the Kopitiam — HFC is the place to go for groceries, healthcare, fashion apparels, or quick-bite dining. It is comparatively vast, clean and cozy.

Getting there is easy, as the Harbour Front MRT station is just a hail away; while buses from Jurong, Bedok or Buona Vista also service the nearby stops.

At the moment, one can utilise their SingapoRediscover credits to visit our southern islands, such as, Kusu and St. John's. Ferries leave the Harbour Front terminal periodically. Please check the tourism board's website or its authorised partners' for more information."
HarbourFront Centre,5,"A place with multiple attractions. Listing a few below:

1. A big shopping mall

But not the kiosk food in the middle lane at level one

I was back here on Jul 3 and Jul 14 as I needed to go for my medical appointment at Alexandra Technopark so I stopped to have my breakfast. As usual, my order will be kaya butter toast or crunchy peanut, hot honey lemon and 2 eggs. Sometimes I ask them for refilling of hot water as the honey was quite sweet and they were not grouchy about this.  The staff at this outlet works hard and they are polite to customers.

HarbourFront Centre,3,"There's nothing much in this building, beyond a transition towards Vivocity. The shops are old or non relevant, and the restaurants are expensive or mostly fast food centric. If not for the fact that I needed to visit the bank, I highly doubt that I'll be here."

Tg Balai is about 1h45min ferry ride to the West. with around 80000 residents it is more laid back than Batam and has less tourists - hardly any Ang Mohs unless the SAIPEMshipyard has a major project and people from Italy etc are coming for work."

HarbourFront Centre,2,Had a female Singaporean/Indian Immigration officer that asked me more questions than any officer ever in my 30+ years of Int'l travel in 34 different countries. At 59 1/2 years old you'd think I would of at least got one respectful smile from her. Not a good welcoming to Singapore. I had only made a 10 hour tour of an offshore drillship.

Sentosa Golf Club,5,Solid place to play golf
Sentosa Golf Club,4,Food is surprisingly good. The local stuff is reliable and I just had a very satisfying reuben.
Sentosa Golf Club,5,300k Members only golf club. Colonial vibes. Championship course will come with championship difficulties level. I'd say this the most difficult course to play in Singapore.
Sentosa Golf Club,5,Lovely game with lovely people and substantial funds raising for School Pocket Money Fund by Citi Charity Golf.
Sentosa Golf Club,5,"Best golf course on the Island and the world!!  Picturesques. The sun,  the greens ans the Sea!!  And beautiful bunglows all around."
Sentosa Golf Club,5,Well maintained golf range. Went there once with my colleagues. Was a good experience out from my usual club.
Sentosa Golf Club,5,"Probably the best golf club in Singapore next to SICC. I love its location with views of the sea and beautifully maintained golf course. It is very popular with golf tournaments as well.

Just a little tip that many do not know! You can actually go for a meal at their golf terrace cafe. It is at the most glorious spot overlooking the entire golf course. Also very popular with the golfers before or after a game of golf. The food is really quite good, portion size is also  quite value for money. Non-club members have to pay a surcharge of 10% to eat there but I think it's a small price to pay because the food is good/affordable and the views sitting there on the terrace  almost makes you feel like you aren't in urban Singapore!"
Sentosa Golf Club,3,Customer service from the front desk should improve. Members or non-members should be treated equally.
Sentosa Golf Club,4,Scenic venue
Sentosa Golf Club,5,Awesome place for golf and food's pretty good too!

Sentosa Golf Club,5,Where else to get this quality in singapore. Nice if you can afford it
Sentosa Golf Club,5,"The Golfer's Terrace at Sentosa Golf Club offers a number of must try dishes. The rojak is excellent -- ingredients are fresh, while the gravy is fragrant and thick. The seafood olive fried rice is a favourite, ditto for the chicken rice -- well-seasoned and soft chicken, yummy rice and served with vegetables and ginger/chilli/dark soy sauce."
Sentosa Golf Club,5,A place to relax and enjoy some golfing.  Beautiful peacock walk around freely. Food price is on the high side since it is a club.
Sentosa Golf Club,5,Very nice place.  Services are great.  Staff are friendly.
Sentosa Golf Club,1,"It was horrible! My car was surrounded by red ants and when I called a few workers, they all just stared blankly and said ""Whatever"" or ""Not my problem"" I got covered by red ants! Food was quite bad,  expensive and low quality."

Sentosa Golf Club,5,
Air Force Museum,4,This smallish museum is free to enter and includes a few different aircraft mostly under cover. There are also a few floors of exhibits including interactive exhibits here which are very strongly air conditioned. This is a reasonable location to visit on a wet day if you have an umbrella to get to the main museum. Expect to spend a bit less than an hour here
Air Force Museum,5,Interesting display of planes and helicopters. Good information about RSAF and it's capabilities too!
Air Force Museum,5,Fantastic experience.  A very well maintained museum with some decent static display aircraft.  Also has a small theatre that tells of the Singapore Air Force.  2nd floor has displays of the different squadrons and missions.  If you have a hour or two to spare well worth the visit.  No cost to enter has a gift shop that sells water also. Glad I went.
Air Force Museum,5,"Interesting place, after that you can go to see the jet fighters during the landing"
Air Force Museum,5,"Do you want somewhere not crowded? And/or your kid like air force stuff? This is the place for! Some more it's free!  Do not set your expectation so high then you might be able to enjoy whatever there.

For parents, if you do some study about air plane before go down, you can easily spend 2 hours with your kid. Take a look every single piece of air plane and talk about it. I recommend to take a look half of ground stuffs then go to theater at o'clock then 2nd story (enjoy some cool air) after that finish rest of ground stuffs."
Air Force Museum,4,Awesome museum to learn about military air crafts and the RSAF through their very interactive displays. There’s even a flight simulator. There is an open gallery with aircraft displays and a couple of very interesting galleries spanning across 3 floors. There’s a gift shop too. Free parking.
Air Force Museum,4,Would have given this place a five star rating if they allow me to have the food in aircon comfort. And if they do not cook with MSG. There is some kind of wow factor about the exhibits.
Air Force Museum,5,Not a crazy selection of planes but if you are close by 100% worth stopping in to check out. Some stuff you won't see elsewhere and the retired airforce guys are great to talk to. It's free and really quiet most of the time it seems. Can hear jets taking off in the background if your lucky which is cool.
Air Force Museum,3,"Not somewhere you would visit unless you have young children who are thrilled to see real fighter jets and helicopters. The outdoor gallery with these real size planes are great although much more can be done to spruce up the place. Some indoor gallery displays and interactive panels were dated, broken or just tired looking."
Air Force Museum,4,It's a pretty good museum. A lot of information regarding planes and many planes and air force related weaponry on display. The interactive displays were not working when I went though.
Air Force Museum,5,Really nice place to see and show aircrafts. These are full size and not samples.
Air Force Museum,4,"Pretty quiet museum. Walked through the entire exhibition (on the second floor) and there was not a single person. The exhibits are really nicely designed and have a lot of interactive functions, great for kids. They offer a lot of information about the air force and allow people to understand how it operates, as well as its history.

They exhibit a lot of old planes that the RSAF used to operate. It would be nice to see an F-15 or F-16 displayed there.

Would be nice to be able to have a working flying simulator here."
Air Force Museum,3,Interesting museum that provides the history of the Singapore aviation. Opportunity to get up close with the old planes on display at the outdoor museum and an air-conditioned display of past aviation artefacts at level 2.
Air Force Museum,4,"A nice place to spend a couple of hours exploring Republic Singapore Air force's history. There's a small theatre, modest display of retired planes and drones, and nice walk through gallery on the second floor. You can head off to tai seng road for a nice lunch afterwards ie ten mins drive"
Air Force Museum,5,They have a great exhibit of all kinds of planes over the period. I loved it. They also show a short film about history of plane building. There is no entry fee.
Air Force Museum,2,Lots of cool and old stuff. But pretty boring and small. Can be done with in 15 minutes.
Air Force Museum,5,"Happen to find out about this Museum from a website and decided to visit it. There are planes that the RSAF used in the past. We can touch it and take photo with it.

The museum has both indoor and outdoor where you get to learn more about the history of RSAF.

A nice place to bring your little ones"
Air Force Museum,4,Great musuem for military aviation and RSAF history. However it lacks of facilities that would certainly make the place more interesting. Museum is filled with static aircraft which served RSAF in the past such as the E-2C Hawkeye AWACS and Fighter aircraft such as the A4-S Skyhawk and Hawker Hunter. Only worth visiting if you have a car or is nearby as it may be difficult to get in by public transportation as waiting times for buses can be quite long.
Air Force Museum,5,"Great place to spend time with your family. Kids will love it because of the exhibits outdoor. Going there by public transport can be a little challenging. There two buses going to the museum (Service 90 and  94) there only one service during Sundays (Service 90). Huge carpark with parking is free ( based on my visit).

Admission to the Museum is free but need register your admission with the reception. Indoor exhibits consist of two levels. If you are lucky you can catch the 10mins video screen about RSAF on level 1."
Air Force Museum,5,Has some good interactive exhibits for kids. Entry is free and takes an hour or two. My son loved the big screen game.
Air Force Museum,5,"Fantastic displays, friendly staff, and free entry; well worth a visit."
Air Force Museum,4,"Not much stuff to see, quite remote place. But still ok for students or kids. Free entry btw."
Air Force Museum,5,Awesome place for explore about the Singapore air force aviation.
Air Force Museum,4,"The Air Force Museum is located beside Paya Lebar airbase.
It is easily accessible by bus and car via the old airport road.
Nearest MRT will be Eunos on the East-West Line.
U can hear the roaring sounds of the jet engines taking off for exercises constantly when you are hear.
I throughly enjoy every visit here as I help out for events at the AFM throughout my NS life."
Air Force Museum,4,Small but cool collection of aircraft. Only a short bus ride away from Paya Lebar MRT
Air Force Museum,4,"The kids love this place. Good open spaces to run around. Things to see, even interactive videogames to play. I'd love to see some F-16 and F-15 displays but yeah it's great!"
Air Force Museum,5,Nice displays and exhibits
Air Force Museum,5,Good place to bring kids around during weekends. The officer there was nice.
Air Force Museum,5,A fantastic place to explore for those who wants to know more about the history of the RSAF!
Air Force Museum,3,"Went to have a look with the kids as it was opened on Sundays. Unfortunately they don't seem well prepared to entertain visitors on Sunday, e.g. no staff manning both the info counter and reception, the shop was also closed. Could be better if the displays allowed visitors to sit in the cockpits."
Air Force Museum,3,Good to learn and see about the air force planes.
Air Force Museum,5,Good experience for kids!!!
Air Force Museum,5,Interesting mesuem.
Air Force Museum,4,Great place for aviation enthusiasts!
Air Force Museum,4,Went there quite some time back but the place is very nice. Managed to learn a lot more about the air force. The museum also hosts some shows at certain timings so keep a lookout for that.
Air Force Museum,5,An excellent museum to understand the Singapore Air Force and their history and capabilities.
Air Force Museum,5,"Nearly every school holiday will bring my kids there for a visit at least twice a year. Constantly the place is being upgraded and the displays are being updated. Great effort and the place is clean, indoor is fully air-conditioned."
Air Force Museum,5,Nostalgic..
Air Force Museum,5,My kids loved this museum. Small but still educational and fascinating. And it’s FREE
Air Force Museum,5,Great experience
Air Force Museum,5,great place to bring your kids for an eye opener of fighter jets and information about planes. equipment could be better maintained as there were quite a handful not functioning. must visit is the souvenir shop but you could get some of the air plane toys outside for a cheaper price.
Air Force Museum,5,Very awesome! Not many people know about this place and so it is rather quiet which is a good thing. It is something for the family to do and explore for free!
Air Force Museum,5,"Quiet place to appreciate Singapore Air Force history. It consists of airplane display outside the museum, airplane display on the first floor and gallery on the 2nd floor. Nothing is on the 3rd floor. There is theatre to show short video on the first floor. Entrance is free but you need to register as a visitor."
Air Force Museum,4,"Was there on a Sat morning and it was near empty, only about 5 other visitors. There are ample parking lots if you are driving. Pretty cool display of many planes and you can touch and take photos with. There is a souvenir shop that sells many toys related to planes... duh. The level 2 gallery was pretty informative. Overall can spend 1hr there, the kids will enjoy the place."
Air Force Museum,5,"Great museum! Free to entry, which is good for family and kids activity. Able to bring the knowledge and historical story to the next generations."
Air Force Museum,5,"Quiet, open air, free museum. This isn't a world class flight museum by any means but it is pretty neat to learn about the uniqueness of Singapore's air force given their small size and get close to several planes and helicopters."
Air Force Museum,5,"One must go to places in Singapore if you are an aviation enthusiast. Many displays of older fighter jets that you can go up to and TOUCH(yes no barriers but advise not to touch).  Many interactive exhibits in the museum even though it’s small. There are nice outdoor exhibits too with even more planes and helicopters and a big Early Warning aircraft (The one with the circle on top). If you are lucky, you may even see a big plane cross the road at there is a taxiway form payla leabar Air Force base time the ST engerning hangers. The best part is, it’s FREE!!!"
Air Force Museum,4,"Quiet and low crowd,but got interesting history and interactive station for youth"
Air Force Museum,4,"Good for killing an hour or so, especially if you're already in the area. Current fleet of jets on display doesn't include any models that are actively in service, so if you're looking for the latest and greatest, best look elsewhere. Historical exhibits are well above average in quantity - they knocked this part out of the park."
Air Force Museum,5,"Great place to visit and friendly stuff to answer all your questions, even called taxi for us, highly recommended."
Air Force Museum,5,Excellent well kept museum. Easy to get to using public transport. Free entry. Small so only about 2 hours needed to see everything. recommend.
Air Force Museum,3,"Good place to learn about the airforce history or what little history we have. Number of old retired aircrafts are laughable. The only good part is the second level where the air-conditioned, small items museums area. Place is free to visit, full of parking spaces, good for family trips."
Air Force Museum,3,Was looking forward to my visit there with high expectations.  It's a chance to see all these jets and aircrafts after all! Left feeling a tad disappointed though; maybe more could be done to bring to live the past glories of those airplanes on the ground floor...
Air Force Museum,5,Super nice...good for family outings and kids to explore aeroplanes :))
Air Force Museum,4,"1. Decent small museum.
2. Free entry.
3. Multiple aircraft and helicopter on display.
4. Souvenirs available at small shop, cash only.
5. Small shows at theatrette.
6. Multiple interactive displays at floor 2,3 as well.
7. Group tours available.
8. Fun if you Interested in Singapore air Force history.
9. Plenty of photo ops."
Air Force Museum,4,"A good insight into the Singapore Air force's history. If you're not a plane buff like me, it'd be best to visit the museum on the second floor. The first floor consists of displays of which I am not very interested in."
Air Force Museum,5,Cool place to visit if you want to learn more about Singapore's air force and aircrafts.
Air Force Museum,4,"The Singapore Air Force Museum do not have any enterence fee for locals or tourist.  It is not a major museum in Singapore, and not popular by tourist.  They displayed lot of aircrafts here, but not very educational.
The museum itself is spacious, with lot of different aircrafts exhibited here.  And they have a tiny cinema as the introduction of Singapore Air Force.  Not much interactive exhibitions here.  But as here is far from city, it's a good place for kids to play around"
Air Force Museum,3,Good
Air Force Museum,5,Fun day out for kids. Spent about two hours at the museum exploring the exhibits. Lots of planes to see and take pictures with.
Air Force Museum,5,Interesting but small.
Air Force Museum,5,Amazing to see real fighter jets and helicopters on their outdoor display. It free entry.
Air Force Museum,5,It's a great place to see history. There's always not many people. So it's a great place to visit minus the crowds. But it's not easily accessible without a car.
Air Force Museum,4,"Nice museum with a few planes for you to see. THere are a few interactive attractions that allows you to play games.

If you have time, to visit this place especially if you are around the corner."
Air Force Museum,4,Althought it's small but a good place to tell story to your kids.
Air Force Museum,4,"The Air Force Museum is a physical embodiment of the history, heritage, and values of the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Since its inception at Changi Air Base on 1 September 1988, the museum has come a long way. Today, it stands in a compound next to Paya Lebar Air Base and creatively combines original artefacts with interactive media. The museum provides an engaging hands-on experience that breathes new life into the RSAF story for all ages."
Air Force Museum,4,Interesting place to view different types of airplanes used by RSAF. Worth a visit
Air Force Museum,2,"Since we don't show the screen to our child, all the second floor was useless to us. I was really hoping that we could get into at least 1 aircraft but they are all closed.  Therefore, there was nothing much to do for us."
Air Force Museum,4,Good for kids to explore with both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Many of the Indoor simulations are down when we visit. A bit disappointed for the kids.  The area is not that big to spend a great deal of time there.
Air Force Museum,5,"Small but excellent museum, well worth a visit."
Air Force Museum,5,Fun day out for kids. Spent about two hours at the museum ...
Air Force Museum,3,"The simulation was fun, with the requirement of teamwork and communication. Not a lot of visitors though, very very little in fact. Some of the display has malfunctioning audio. But overall, still impressed with the display."
Air Force Museum,5,A good place to bring children to learn about the history of the Singapore Air Force. The plane models also make for great photo opportunities!
Air Force Museum,5,"Cool models, great for photo taking and posting in social media"
Air Force Museum,4,"Nice spacious exhibition areas. Ground floor level: display of decommissioned Jets and helicopters. Upstairs exhibits traces history, mission and information of RSAF."
Air Force Museum,4,"Free place to bring kids and spend time with for about an hour or so. There are big aeroplanes, helicopters, interactive displays and more to see."
Air Force Museum,5,"Very educational. Provides a good history of the air Force, and the kids love walking around and looking at the various aircrafts and helicopters."
Air Force Museum,4,A quiet museum that not many people aware
Air Force Museum,4,Free! Not crowded and enjoyable to visit. Little video games and such inside but many of them not working anymore
Air Force Museum,4,A good account of the history og the Air Force. Exhibits are working. Kids will love the interactive games.
Air Force Museum,5,Brilliant. Apart from the absolute bell-end of an air force member getting over zealously officious over who could sign the visitors register. An excellent museum to understand the Singapore Air Force and their history and capabilities.
Air Force Museum,5,"Nice exhibits, plant aspirational seeds in children (and adults alike)"
Air Force Museum,4,Good place to learn about how air force in Singapore used to be. Just a little bit small
Air Force Museum,5,RSAF museum showing the history of our air force. Really cool place with quite a handful of live display of previous generation air crafts as well as an indoor air conditioned exhibit with more displays. The guide is knowledgeable and is engaging as well.
Air Force Museum,5,It is a nice museum for kids to get introduced to history of Air force of Singapore.
Air Force Museum,5,Excellent! I wish they could have more modern machines.
Air Force Museum,3,"Nice museum for kids to see real planes. On the downside, the interactive booths weren't working well and ending up frustrating my kids."
Air Force Museum,4,Good place to learn and appreciate the air force. Kids will love it
Air Force Museum,4,Kids had an awesome time playing with all the interactive displays
Air Force Museum,5,My first visit was in 2006 and I was 6 years old back then.is been 12 years since i last visited and this museum made my childhood days so awesome!👍
Air Force Museum,4,This is free place. We can bit enjoy.
Air Force Museum,4,"Exhibits finally overhauled in the past few years. Compact museum which can be fully sampled in 30 minutes - 1 hour, so factor that in before you make the trip down."
Air Force Museum,5,Knowing the history of the RSAF.  The aircrsft static displays are well maintained.
Air Force Museum,5,Awesome place! You can touch every plane. It's not very big but worth going there.
Air Force Museum,5,Great for kids who love fighter jets. It's free too!
Air Force Museum,4,Small place but nice to stand so close to a fighter jet
Air Force Museum,5,Try the game on level 2 it's very interesting. We spend 1hour playing the game.
Air Force Museum,4,Place of nostalgia. History of Singapore planes. Kids friendly and educative
Air Force Museum,3,Nice aircon place to see the Singapore Air force progress but not much excitement. FOC admission and parking.
Air Force Museum,5,My grand son enjoyed the place
Air Force Museum,4,"Interesting places for kids that loves aviation history or like airplanes. Not so far, but you need to use both MRT and bus to go there."
Air Force Museum,4,"A quiet place to learn about Singapore Military aircraft. Via public transport, just take the train to tai seng mrt, and from there take bus 90 to this museum.

The museum itself is quite windy, due to the super high ceiling, so it's also a good place to take shelter from the sun.

For the kids, it is quite a fun place with all the planes and helicopters, definitely will be an unforgettable place for them!"
Air Force Museum,5,Love the fighter jet simulator but other than that exhibitions were told short and lack of sufficient captivating content
Air Force Museum,5,Fighter jet simulator is interesting. This is a nice place to visit.
Air Force Museum,5,Admission is FREE! The place is a little ulu (deserted/in the middle of nowhere). Only Bus can get you near there. The place has a wide array of planes and helicopters to show. There is a 2nd floor where you can play some games and learn more about different planes!

Air Force Museum,5,"(Translated by Google) Although it is not a large-scale translation like the Smithsonian, it was displayed so that the induction part and the warhead part of the infrared missile (probably aim-9) could be seen, and the cockpit (instruments etc.) of the fighter aircraft could be seen The glass is cloudy, and there are reflections of sunlight depending on the time of day. If you like military, you can enjoy it.

スミソニアンの様な大規模な訳ではないが赤外線ミサイル(恐らくaim-9)の誘導部分や弾頭部分が見えるように展示してあったり、戦闘機のコックピット(計器類等そのまま)を覗き込めたり(ガラスが曇っており、更に時間帯によっては日差しの反射もあり、結構見辛い)と、中々見応えがある。ミリタリー好きな方なら結構楽しめると思う。"
Air Force Museum,4,"(Translated by Google) A facility to understand the history and role of the Singapore Air Force. Successive fighter planes and helicopters are lined up outdoors, and the facilities inside provide easy-to-understand explanations with videos and gimmicks. The air force base is next to it, so there is a facility for people involved, so it has an atmosphere.
The shops are small, but we are satisfied with the original products. There is no exhibit for Singapore Air Force, F15 or F16, which is said to be the strongest air force in ASEAN, but I am satisfied.

Air Force Museum,5,"(Translated by Google) It's free, but you can see the history of the development of the Singapore Air Force. Hawker hunters have suddenly switched to the F-16, began to deploy the F-15 SG, and have a history of rapid modernization. The greatest attraction here is the exhibition of the TA-4SU with individual canopy with F404.
I was training the F-15SG at the Air Force Base next to me.

There are some exhibits on the second floor, mainly models and videos. It may take an hour to visit the museum, two at most two hours. Apart from being small, there is nothing wrong with it.

Attica,1,"If you get used to European clubs, better mind this place. It doesn't matter how much money you give to the bartender. They expect the rest as tip. The club closes at 4 am. At 3:50 they ask you to finish your drink, no matter how empty it is. If you don't follow the staff, they get super angry with you. Even the music was very cool, I will not come again."
Attica,5,"Had a great night out at this place. The layout of the place is really interesting as one side of the space has a bar, bottle service and a dance floor. The other side also has a dance floor too. The atmosphere was fun and welcoming and unlike some other clubs, had room to move around."
Attica,5,Very nice Club in Singapore with always an awesome crowd there. My first to go when in Singapore. Nice interieur and alsways playing nice music. Yaaay!
Attica,5,"I had a really good time here, our Singaporean friend took us here and even got free entry. The club was brilliant, the music was just what made our last night in Singapore.

If you like RnB and House/Techno then this is the place for you. The vibe was also very good, everyone was having an amazing time"
Attica,5,"Really great staff working there. Staff are very well mannered and entry into the club was hassle-free and fast! Tho there are more foreigners inside the club, it makes you as in you're not in sg! Gr8!"
Attica,5,Nice environment. A club with good music and lovely dancefloor. We got free entry on the day we went. Had a good time!!
Attica,4,"A nice big club.

Music is great. Alcohol is decent (in terms of price and choices)

Crowd - mix of local and foreigner.

however it is too bright for a club."
Attica,4,The music and crowd was really good. The atmosphere was amazing. We really like how big the place was. There are lockers in the club to put our bags in and the bae tenders are very nice and efficient. We went on ladies night and got twelve free drinks each. So we were very happy with the place.
Attica,5,Pretty decent club
Attica,5,Home away from home
Attica,5,"Atmosphere was great! Music much better inside as compared to the outside area. You see all most of the crowd flowing towards the inner area.
Been there a few times and would definitely going back again.

However the quality of the customers really need to improve, came across some of the customers that ask for free plain water, don't even want to pay for bottled water.

Hindering the bartenders from serving paying customers like us. In my opinion, bartenders are there to serve alcoholic drinks."
Attica,2,"Always ask till what time bar is opened before entering. They do NOT tell at time of entering the club. They do sell $50 8 drinks till last moment and they dont tell you that bar will be closed in half hour or one hour. If you dont use your 8 drinks coupon in that one hour (suppose if you entered at 2am), those drinks coupon r wasted. If you go before 00.30 and go for $5 drink, you'll probably end up waiting in queue only. Music is OK. Inside club is more happening compared to outside."
Attica,4,"Great place and music!
Though the carpeting and the sofa needs a massive change out due to the stench!

If you're there for the music: great place

If you're there to open bottles and sit at the sofa: the odour of the carpet will definitely turn you off!!"
Attica,4,Great club to drink and have a great time with friends. They have divided the club into 2 halves with 2 different dance floors and two different DJs which gives you a option to choose which one you prefer.
Attica,4,Good music to dance to but starts to feel repetitive after a few visits. Still a club I enjoy and great for first timers.
Attica,4,"All I can say when I was here: ""It's paaaarty tiiiime!"""
Attica,5,Plenty of room to dance and walk about with not bad of a crowd
Attica,4,Im so sad this place is closing down. they played mainstream pop that was familiar to most and my friends and I loved this place
Attica,5,"Excellent club with 2 different rooms, a pure electro and a more pop electro. Awesome decoration in the second one."
Attica,4,Service is quick and the drinks are great. Music sound quality is good:)
Attica,1,"Forst time to be in this club, so i observe things which make me disappointed and not to think to back again... 1st, The attitude  of security is very poor, no cooperation, no professionalism at all. 2nd , the bartender did even bother to provide back the change, this noted by my frnds too. Thats bad experience got"
Attica,4,"Great bar tenders, ok music and sound system, spacious with lounge sitting areas, central location"
Attica,4,Really good music. Alcohol can be affordable when promotions are going on.
Attica,5,"Very nice club, with pretty decent DJs for usual partying. Pretty fun to go there"
Attica,5,"Amazing place for party! Lights, DJ, and space is just awesome! 😁"
Attica,4,The classical paintings are hella cool B)
Attica,1,"Summary:
-  F might probably stand for Fraud.
- There are many better clubs
- Biggest deal breaker: their staffs.

Rude, unprofessional and bias bouncers against guys or non-big-spenders entering the club. The club promoters were really nice and helpful to let us have the Fclub Experience by giving us a pair of GuestList ticket for me and my girlfriend to try out. Since we had free entry, we were planning on spending that money on the drinks inside and getting hammered.

Unfortunately things went sour real quick when i met those rude bouncers. Up front, before we enter, for no good reason, they split us up into male and female. Letting the girls in with just a simple glanced at their IDs while i had to wait for whichever bouncer is kind enough to check the guys' queue.

The queue was barely moving until, guess what, the period for GuestList was over. The bouncer still let us (guys) in without a word despite showing him the now-expired GuestList card. Wow must be a nice guy uh? Nope! Once ive walked passed the entrance, there's a dark corner alley where a bouncer stood still in the middle, blocking the way and demand you to pay for cover charge.

I then went on to explain to him nicely that I've been let in by his colleague at the door and showed him the ticket. He just starred back at me and raised his voice ""I dont care, if i said you pay, means you pay. Don't club if you don't have money"". And when I did not take our my wallet for payment, other bouncer came and pointed the way to leave.

Just wow ... I was stunt that fclub Singapore would hire such unprofessional bouncers to welcome their party-goers. Such a waste of the Fclub brand stained by such low quality services.

Funny enough my girlfriend was already outside waiting coz she didnt see me in the club and there was lots of army boys inside.

After we drank at Zouk (to cool off my steam) and we met club Avery promoter and took a short Grabride there. Alcohol was reasonably affordable, music was great! And the bouncers were really approachable.

Spent a total of 280SGD there alone but would gladly spend there again than Fclub."
Attica,4,The atmosphere is good but music is relitively average.
Attica,5,"No.1 Best club ever. Just patronise F. Club, will sure enjoy being there. Thumb UP 🎊🎆🎇✨🎈🎉🏆🎖👍👍👍👍👍"
Attica,4,"Good club featuring one edm stage and a hip-hop one. Popular with locals, the bouncers tend to get selective when it's nearly full house and force you to buy bottles. Dance floors are also pretty small."
Attica,5,Love the place!! They have two rooms with two different music vibes. One of my fave clubs in Clarke Quay!
Attica,4,"Nice club in clarke quay, happening and good looking people here"
Attica,3,A big club. But I don’t have another feeling for it.

Remarks:"
Attica,3,This club is overrated af. Hit this place up if you want to dance with a bunch of drunk guys fresh out of BMT that aren't even fun to dance with.
Attica,1,"Went on the 29th of December, I was ordering a drink at the bar and asked the bartender if he could get me a cup of water as well. He took an empty cup, placed it on the bar counter and told me ""toilet got tapwater"". I then asked him multiple times but he repeated the same thing over and over again. Needless to say I was pretty upset. There was zero respect given on top of poor attitude and service. Left straight afterwards to get water from outside and just went to zouk instead. Music was okay but service is bad. If you plan on opening a table I recommend spending your money elsewhere."
Attica,1,"Had a very bad experience here. We put our belongings in the locker, the person in charge (Yara) issue us a rubber band with a tag number on it. Shortly after, I realised the tag was missing (the rubber band was still intact along with the ring but the tag was not properly secured and it came off). Yara was super rude and she insist that we should pay for the lost tag. I told her that I remembered the tag number and was also able to identify the locker as well as what's inside the locker. She continued to ask us for money else she wouldn't give us our bags, and even asked her manager, Adi, to come over. Adi did not even cared to listen even though we managed to get the correct locker unlocked (we were also able to identify the bags). He insisted on collecting $30 even though it was their mistake that the tag was not even properly secured. I really hope that they weren't trying to pocket the money. Because upon asking for their names, then only they told me that they will bring this up to their management and refund me accordingly. This doesn't make sense. Lesson learnt, never coming back or bringing my friends to this place ever. They'll try to squeeze whatever they can outta you."
Attica,5,Pretty decent club frequented by locals and expats a-like
Attica,4,Was good on Wednesday night with more girls and less guys
Attica,1,"Never picks up the phone, really bad service :("

Attica,5,"(Translated by Google) One person enters after 23:00
Although it was Halloween, I was able to enter the store without saying anything. There was no disagreement at the time of admission. Moreover, there is no charge on this day! Many people dressed up on the floor, but there was no cold feeling like it was rising on the inner ring, there were various races, and there were no scary people and I enjoyed it without worry.
In addition, it was a peaceful audience with zero tobacco and no drunk. Someone spills a drink, and a person who looks like security immediately puts on a mop and feels great. Is it a national pattern?

ハロウィンだったが普通の格好で何も言われず入店できました。入場時全然嫌な感じはありませんでした。しかもこの日はノーチャージ！フロアは仮装した人達が多く盛り上がっていましたが、決して内輪で盛り上がってるようなお寒い感じもなく、人種も様々で、怖い人もおらず心置きなく楽しめました。
くわえタバコゼロ、泥酔者ゼロというなんともピースフルなオーディエンスでした。誰かが飲み物をこぼしたらしく、すぐさまセキュリティの格好をした人がモップをかけてたり、行き届いてる感がすごい。お国柄なのかな。"

Walking around the Reservoir and inside forest is always refreshing feeling."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,"Love the walk. Especially the short part by the water, in fact, over the water. Was pretty sunny and thus hot when we went but it was cool whenever we were in vegetation. Spotted so much wildlife along the way, it was amazing. Colugo, Blue Sprite, squirrels, some lizard like thingy with scales.... ☺️

We parked at Casuarina, lunched and started the walk from that end. Ended at the car park where we could use the toilet and topped up our way before heading back. Many rest spots along the way with benches."

Overall the place is worth visiting !"
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Sunrises for the early birds

Sunsets for the romance"
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,"Scenic park with very manageable terrain and length, even for seniors. Amazing boardwalk leaves u wishing it could be longer. During peak period like weekends, may not be able to linger longer on the boardwalk due to the passing crowd."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"It was therapeutic to walk late in the night along the boardwalk, listening to the sounds of crickets, the croaking of frogs, the dripping sound of water.  And to see silhouette of the leaves and branches cast by the distance lamps...
PC: Alvin Ng; Alfred Ong"
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,Quieter this period but not any less charming. Very breezy and a good spot to beat the humidity.
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Been here quite a lot ever since I was introduced to this place.  It's a super easy trek down.  The walk is covered in trees so you don't really get direct sunlight.  Walk takes about 30 mins with views from trees, to a bit of a dried down stream, opening to the view of the reservoir, and finally to the resting area/ fishing area/ carpark.

It is quite hard to go to this place as there is no near train station.

There can be sightings of monkeys and boars quite regularly."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Beautiful place for a weekend walk and picnic. Although there are limited sheltered areas in case of bad weather, there are sufficient benches along the path to rest if needed."

Park close at 7 p.m. At the end of the walk, is eatery such as the famous Casuarina Prata shop. Otrwise, one can also choose to continue the walk/run to Upper Pierce Reservoir (UPR) which enterance is nearby. Be prepared for a 2-way, 6 k.m..journey to & out of UPR park."

Broadwalk has amazing views of the reservoir and the water is clear. There is even fishing grounds here though some points to take note are posted at the entrance."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"This is my new favourite with manageable trails for every age group, unguarded boardwalk that lead along the clear water of the reservoir. Easy accessibility from Casuarina side if you oob to cover other nature parks like Thomson and Springleaf. We did spot a wild boar, few monkeys and could see fishes in the water. There are tons of insect for macro photography as well."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,They are many good walking trails here. Nice scenery

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"From Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to Thomson Nature Park, the surrounding residents of Sembawang Hill Estate are pretty fortunate enough to live near so many wonderful parks and reservoirs. Amongst them is Lower Peirce Reservoir Park.

The park is decently sized and is definitely one of the most family friendly parks to visit in Singapore for a variety of activities - Fishing, board walking by the water, forest trail walking, catching spiders, monkey watching and yes, even holding a wedding proposal...!!

Fun fact - The geographical centre of Singapore is actually located at the 1st resting shelter that you'll come across before entering the forest trail, do activate your Google Maps and mark the location when you're there..!!"

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,Pretty scenery and mostly shaded. Quite a few monkeys around that appear very acclimated to humans.  Watch your bags!
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Singapore’s second reservoir. It does not feel old at all. Entry via Jacaranda Rd takes you along the broadwalk to the reservoir. The path is generally shaded with the dense secondary forest. It is cooler under the shade. Further down the path takes you to the water’s edge. It is an easy kid friendly walk though not stroller or wheelchair friendly. Coming here gives one a sense of peacefulness and calm. Spot the monkeys, dragonflies and pond skaters along the way. It is a lovely spot to spend a Saturday morning."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,"Virgin forest.
Beautiful view.

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,3,Beautiful sunset
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"The scenery is really nice plus the weather was solid at that time, not too hot, not rainning just chill vibes all around we arrive her at 8.30am so for your future refference. Come here early morning the scenery is really beautiful. There alot of people tho makcik and uncle auntie. But i guess good place for couples too for hiking the trails. Not bad for a run too honestly, people come here to fish there specific fishing zones but honestly some people just dont care about the rules. The toilet here is okay but could be better, its just what you normally expect from a park toilet."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"A lovely nature ,fresh air.."

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,Manageable short walk along the reservoir. Parking was bad so many people parked at the side of the road
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,A quiet place for a morning workout or for exercising. Do be careful with the monkeys and don't feed them or they will be after you (or your food). Do note that there's limited parking on site especially if you come in after 9am on a weekend. There's a park connector which has less traffic and good for a jog.
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Went in via Casuarina Rd. Very walkable with wooden planks and not much hilly slope. Rather short track though with 6,000 steps unless you loop twice. Not that great for running as plank is narrow and there are many families with small kids. Unless very early morning where there is lesser crowd. Great though for leisurely walk."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Beautiful nature place, turn in from Thomson Road (be careful to always keep to the left, as the only road is shared by pedestrian, cyclists and cars), turn on the first left turn, somehow did not see a proper sign board), and up short slop and dah-dah, beautiful lower pierce reservoir, take the time to enjoy the nature, seeing monkeys and squirrels, and enjoy the moment. Will definitely be back for more!"

Limited parking lots nearby or you will need to park at the private estates and walk over to the entrance of the reservoir.
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,The boardwalk there is a must do!
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,"Its relaxing here n the  boardwalk along the waterline is very soothing.  I prefer this to Macritche.  Very accessible location, is within ten minutes walk to the cosy Sembawang Hills Food Centre.  No Mrt but several bus stops and toilets near entrance."

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"This is a very small park with some gazebos and benches. You're allowed to fish here.

Watch out for the monkeys along the road and path."

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"Lower Peirce Reservoir, officially opened on 26 March 1912, is the second-oldest impounding reservoir in Singapore. Built at the lower portion of Kallang River in 1910, the reservoir was originally known as the Kalang (old spelling of “Kallang”) River Reservoir.

It was renamed Peirce Reservoir in 1922 to commemorate the service of Robert Peirce, municipal engineer of Singapore from 1901 to 1916. The Upper Peirce Reservoir was created upstream of the existing one in 1975, following which the older reservoir was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir.

In 1904, the municipality granted approval for the project; two years later, construction commenced. The reservoir, with a total catchment area of 3,007 ac (1,216 ha; including the upper-stream portion of the Kallang Tunnel Works), was completed in 1910. The tender for the projected was awarded to London’s Westminster Construction Company for 967,641 Straits dollars.

The new reservoir had a storage capacity of at least 750 million gallons (3.4 million cu m) and supplied 3.5 million gallons (15,911 cu m) per day, increasing the total daily water supply to some 9 million gallons (40,914 cu m).

The Kalang River Reservoir was officially opened on 26 March 1912 by then Governor John Anderson. For the event, a commemorative stone was specially imported from Aswan, Egypt, and laid at the reservoir. The stone can still be found at the reservoir today.

A decade later, in 1922, the reservoir was renamed Peirce Reservoir in honour of the municipal engineer who served in the position from 1901 to 1916."

After seeing a couple of freshwater stingrays near the Spill way, I emailed and called the PUB Hotline. I'm very impressed by the prompt call back by 2 different staff Zul and Norman to verify and confirm the time and location of the sightings. Bravo!"

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"If you are into long distance running, you can probably start at the lower Pierce reservoir car park and run all the way upto upper Pierce Reservoir on the Old Upper Thomson road( Take a left turn at Casuarina to enter the upper Pierce park). The road has a lot of humps so it's definitely a moderate to difficult effort for runners/walkers but worth it.The view from Upper Pierce is amazing.Must visit. The total running distance back and forth from Lower Pierce to Upper and return would be 9-10Kms and makes for a good weekend long run."
Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,4,"The environment is nice for a short walk, or just sit there and enjoy the fresh air, much better than Macriche I would say. And the reservoir feels quite clean and well maintained.
The shortage I feel is it only has one way, once reach the end have to return back through the same way. Other wise just leave from the residential exit."

Walking along the trail, you can spot small animals like mouse deer looking shyly at you.  Mother wild boars roaming with their children. Suddenly a leader comes, making noise and lead them away. Such an amazing picture you can only see at the cinema. Small monkeys chasing one after another. A baby monkey lost the grip from his mother and fell, but managed to land safely on the bush. Two big cobras wrestled fiercely and one ended up in another's stomach. Strolling along the trail, admiring the beauty of nature is a great pleasure here.
The trail is upgraded and very comfortable for the seniors to stroll. Peirce Reservoir has been upgraded and the garden is beautified with more designed greens and facilities.

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,5,"(Translated by Google) The park is super big in the form of a hill ... but the park is only on one side of the hill, so it is divided into 2 sides ""Upper"" _ going up the hill_ with ""Lower"" _ going down the hill_ named Peirce Reservoir Parks. I am in the Lower side, because if I go on the Upper side, the road will be like a blue wave, I cannot go fast but now I am late, after taking pictures, it will be dark.
Being home to a reservoir and a park, but with the level of nature conservation in Singapore, entering this park is no different than going to the forest. The air is clear, Singapore is fresh, then here to filter the lungs for free 👍 I normally spend time taking pictures of wild birds and flowers, but that day is too hurry. There are many strange flowers that cannot be saved 😢

Mình đang ở bên Lower, tại nếu đi bên Upper đường đi sẽ như sóng lam-đa, không đi nhanh được mà giờ mình tới cũng muộn rồi, chụp xong hình là trời tối om.
Là nơi có hồ chứa nước đồng thời là công viên, mà với mức độ bào tồn thiên nhiên ở Singapore thì vào công viên này không khác gì vào rừng đâu. Không khí thì khỏi nói, Singapore đã trong lành thì vào đây lọc phổi không mất phí 👍 Bình thường mình sẽ dành thời gian chụp hình chim rừng bướm lượn cây hoa lá cành nhưng mà hôm đó vội quá.

Lower Peirce Reservoir Park,1,"(Translated by Google) It was very good, but it was a pity that there was a big sunny day at noon, and there was no way to stay for long. In addition, the beautiful grassland in the past has been dug and devastated, which is very distressing. One more thing is that it was recently discovered that the pool is allowed to ride bicycles? In the past, there was no such thing. In the morning, a large group of young children and elderly people were doing morning exercises. They saw 4, 5 or even more than 10 vehicles from the parking lot. Entrance to the sidewalk pool to compete with ""walkers"". Of course it is us ""people"" who are afraid 😨 instead of riding~biking!
I feel very helpless. When everyone is jogging, they run to the east side in coordination, and to the left side to the west. However, it doesn't work anymore. When the ""Iron Ghost"" arrives, every poor person has to ""get away"" and let the ""Iron Cavalier"" pass first. Please tell me, will you be disappointed?
Please take the initiative for those knights, don't ""foul"", go only when they should go, and don't ride ""iron knights"" with people of all ages and young people to ""snap""!

非常的不错，只可惜到中午就有好大的艳阳天，没办法久留。另外，以往漂亮的草地，都被挖到满地疮痍，好心疼。再一个另外，就是近来发现，水池允许骑脚踏车吗?过去完全没有，早上一大帮年轻的小孩，老人，在做晨运时，看到4，5辆甚至10多辆浩浩荡荡从停车场入口到人行道水池边与""漫步人士争道""。怕😨的当然是我们这些""人""而非骑马~脚踏车""的人啦！
我觉得很无奈，大家在慢跑时，很配合的往东的跑一边，往西的就跑左边。但，现在可不通了，见""铁鬼""骑到，就每个可怜人都要""闪开""一边让""铁骑""先过。请你们说说看，你们会扫兴吗？

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin is an excellent place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore City lifestyle. Take a ferry from Changi ferry terminal (Changi Village) and it cost $4 each person for one way. There are few kampung houses, eateries and renting of bicycle. You can choose either to walk or cycle around the island. Lots of nature to see and enjoy... oh ya... Look at the weather forecast before you go. Make sure it's not raining that day. Highly recommended!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Extremely scenic place and nice 'short' trip away from bustling Singapore. Would recommend renting a bike and exploring the place as it is only $8 for the whole day (depending on which shop you choose). And if you ever do visit, do bring an insect repellant- it will really save you from all the bites plus some cash!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Love this island that's north of Singapore. Take the ferry from Changi point ferry terminal and escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore to the forests and kampongs of years past.

Advisable to rent bicycles to explore the island. Start with east with a trip to Chek Jawa wetlands but also go west to the various mountain bike trails (of you'd like).

Carry cash for all expenses."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,It’s a nice place to trek and cycle. I just discovered 1/3 island in a day. I will come here soon.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Go to Ubin in mid June onwards coz it'll be durian season.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Wonderful place and the island glanced me my kampong memories...
The island is full of greenery with playful monkeys. Perfect place for beginners cyclist. Ubinians (people there are very friendly and they share their personal feelings with tourist.)
The ferry from Changi ferry point terminal to pulau ubin island cost $4/person, extra charges for cyclists.
we also went for Tree planting event under NParks."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Wow wonderful place but I have no time to go
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,3,It is a bit disgusting and dirty but its really fun to bike there!
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Nice place to explore during Covid-19 and travel to other countries is out of the question. The quarry there is really beautiful, but beware don’t swim or fall into the water from great heights. Quarry pond is very dangerous as the water is usually very deep due to excavation."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"A nice place that you can get away to,  from the mad rush of our everyday life in Singapore. Good place to be closer to nature, birds, monkeys, boars, squirrels, etc. Good place to learn about the local fruits trees. It's like going back to Singapore in the 60s.

To reach Ubin, you need to take the ferry at the Changi Village ferry terminal. Boat Fee is $4 one way per head."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Good getaway
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Definitely a good place for nature lover or an escaped from our daily reinforce concrete jungle.
I would recommend to rent a bicycle there. Go to the west part and enjoy walking on the new broadways and visit the viewing tower, very relaxing!!!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great way to get connected to nature by visiting Pulau Ubin. Rustic place to explore either by bicycles or tracking. Lovely layback place for nature lovers.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Good for cycling and nice nature walking
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"This is the best place for one day getaway from Singapore. Lovely place for nature lovers. Hire a good condition bike and ride around. Be careful while riding uphill and downhill as there are high chances of falling down.

We covered 1/3 island in half day. There are coastal boardwalks and this pathway offers beautiful views of the sea on one side and other side can see forests, rocks and beaches.

Must visit Jejawi Tower. Climb the tower and go to the top, it offers beautiful view of the island."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place for cycling and a bit of trekking. Have been there last August 15, 2020."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Nice place for one day outing to explore nature. Located at north east of Singapore, its a 15 mins boat ride from Changi. Boat ride costs 4 sgd. Rented bicycle are available when you get down at the Island. It would cost somewhere between 10-20 sgd based on the condition of the cycle. Eat and drink options limited, only near the entrance. Better to get your own food and drinks. Beware of wild boars, will not harm you but will snatch any food items from you."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Always rustic & old world charm! Come & support local tourism as the folks at ubin are all really genuine honest folks looking to make a living.  It's so surreal to have uncle at kopi tiam doing safe entry checkin & temperature taking!
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"This is a wonderful experience to have if you are in Singapore. Remember to wear comfortable shoes. You can bring your own bicycle or can be rented from here..bicycle rental price for whole day between $13 - 40. You can rent a good condition one for $13. Before you rent the bicycle just go a trial ride and choose which is comfortable for you. There is a long way to ride around the island. So it's better having hand glouse.

Bring some mosquito repellent, water bottles & snacks. There are some vending machines inside the island. Have some cash in your pocket. You can buy fresh coconut drink for $5 on the way."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Lovely half-day “getaway” from Singapore. Thankful that the ferries make it easy to get there and back. Although prices have gone up (now $4 per trip instead of $2 because of covid), it is well worth the trip to this little natural island. You can almost pretend you’re somewhere else (Vietnam... Thailand... Ecuador...) Go on a day with blue skies and good weather, the temperature might be hot but the views will be so worth it! Bring lots of water!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Family enjoyed the day to see something different. $4pp boat ride, bike hire available but we decided to walk the island. Grab a cold drink at the local stores & some food or pack a picnic!"

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great  View!!
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,It is so wonderful and awesome 👏
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"1st time here..

Enjoy the nature here.

Arrived Changi Ferry Jetty around 8:30 am took a boat to Pulau  Ubin Jetty $4 per person.

Rented a bicycle  for $15 per bicycle..they bicycle  for for rent range from.$10 to $25 per day..

Spend good 5 hours in the island..

Go early to prevent  queues  and crowding for renting bicycle.

Caution ⚠️  keep all your food stuff in proper bag (not visible). So that Monkeys  will not rob your food.

While entering  Chek Jawa .. DO NOT leave your bag  on the bicycle.. Monkeys  will go thru your bag  and take whatever  they can eat."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Great place to get back to ""some "" nature in tiny Singapore.

Very very very important to stress the following points:
1. Please DO NOT feed the wild animals.  In fact please avoid bringing food with you when hiking or cycling.
2. Respect the fact that YOU are the intruder here.  The animals here are wild, and WILL attack if provoked, approached or see you eating or drinking.

During our family's trip there, we've seen a lady got attacked and badly injured by a wild boar.  Plus a monkey almost attacked my son, when he lifting his water bottle for a drink.

Other than that it's a great place to go hiking.

Finally please remember that you still need to wear mask, and maintain social distancing (virus don't care about geography!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,A very peacefulllllll place
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Great dayout of Singapore main island. Pulau Ubin has several different gem locations for great IG photos
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin is an island northeast of mainland Singapore. Cycle trails and footpaths criss-cross the hills, going past disused granite quarries and traditional kampongs (villages). Kingfishers and bulbul birds inhabit the tidal flats and mangroves of the Chek Jawa Wetlands. The Jejawi observation tower and a looped boardwalk offer views of this area. Fo Shan Ting Da Bo Gong Temple houses statues of local deities."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great escape fr concrete jungle
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Do note the restaurants are closed during this HA period, only drink stalls are open.

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place to go hiking. Get plenty of water as there will be shops only near the coast. And you have to keep some money handy as there is no atm in the island. It's advised to rent a bicycle and see the whole place. Bicycle rent varies from stores. I rented two bicycles( 4 persons can travel) for 30 dollars.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Nice place to see the beautiful quarries and trees and wetlands.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Nothing beats the walk to nature, Kampong & mountain bike trail."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Wonderful place to enjoy nature and escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Best optionis to rent a bicyle and ride around the island.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin is a nice nature place for family outing. However is the bad choice for taking meal there. The ""fresh"" seafood restaurant price is not cheap with that kind of taste and serving. Bring own food and drink, there are more worthy food at Changi Point hawker center after returning to main land."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Pulau Ubin is another island off Singapore and is a great place for cycling and outdoor activities. We travelled there by bumboat from Changi Point Ferry Terminal. Explore the beaches and mangrove areas on our own and this island is unique because it is home to animals and plants that are already extinct in many parts of the world.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"A place built for recreation in groups,family or individual.  A place for us to remembered our root whete we start from a red dot country from null to being recognise as an organization.👍✌🙏❤"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Amazing and unexpected place. I am not expecting I can get something like this place in Singapore. 100 recommended to jungle, cycle and hiking lovers."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Was here for a trail by EMA. It was quite insightful learning about how 30 residents on Pulau Ubin pay for solar energy instead of running their own diesel generators. Apparently it costs more money to run diesel and the generators sometimes break down. I like the laid back environment here, it's very rustic, but there's also a lot of mosquitoes."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Such a wonderful Island😍
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"You need a ferry ride to reach this place. Cycles are available on rent, we enjoyed up and downhill cycling, loved fresh coconut water, never tasted anything like it before!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Beautiful scenery and wildlife. Ferry tickets cost $4 each way. There are bikes for rental which offer a quick way to get around the island. There’s plenty of stuff to explore so you could easily make multiple trips on different occasions. Sunscreen and mosquito repellent are your best friends as it can get pretty hot in the afternoon.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"There are footpaths and bicycle trails, a good place to hike, cycle and get near to nature. Away from the hustle and bustle mainland. Advisable to bring own water and snacks as provision shops and eateries are near jetty only."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Great place for cycling!

You can rent a bicycle for the entire day. Price is between $12-$20++ depends on the type of bicycle

I’ve been to Pulau Ubin several times, but on my last visit, the bicycle i rented got stolen at the Chek Jawa parking area, so be careful.

I have to walk my way back to Ferry terminal :("
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Amazing island- a must do if you visit Singapore! Highly recommend hiring a bike on the island to get around as you'll miss so much if you take a van. Monkeys are everywhere so you'll get great photos of them.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,It was filled with nature
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"It is perfect place to enjoy cycling and hiking with family, friend. Cycling through the forest and paved way feel so good. I saw monkey and wild boar. Small boat in between Pulau Ubin and Changi takes 10-15 min. I want to come again for cycling all day."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"The only place that I can go trekking, fishing, crabbing and camping at the same time. If you like mountain biking, this is the place too. Great place for photography as well. A 4 🌟 is due to certain place is not accessible by public, what a waste."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Nice place. $3 bum boat from changi point to island and $3 for return and $2 for bicycle if you want to roam on the island as jogging will take 3,4 hours to check out all the places. Better take bicycle and check all the on island. Beware of falling trees."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Bike around the island. If u r lucky, u may see the wild boar , red jungle fowl , toucan , fiddler crab and so much more."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Great place for a getaway when you are in Singapore. Small island, can be covered in a day. Cycling seems to be the best option to explore. Direction sign boards are proper., So navigation is hassle free. Cash only island."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"It is a good weekend gateway to escape the city. The ferry capacity is 12 passengers and one way costs sgd 3.

I went to the Pulak hill and the wetland only. I went there on foot and the time was about 45 mins one way to the wetland and 45 mins coming back. To hike the hill, it was Super easy too, just about 15 mins to go up to enjoy the view. Even you wanna ride a bike it is only 5 sgd for the whole day.

Be careful of monkeys if you are carrying any fruits or plastic bag."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,good place for cycling. you can carry your own bicycle or rent it in the island
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Government better not develop this piece of rustic island
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,A nice place to spend a day. Can do cycling.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin may seems barren. But, if you are willing to go off the beaten tracks, you may find some peaceful spots to take in the island charm like this hidden beach facing Changi that is not too far from the jetty."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Wonderful short trip.....
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Really fun place to go for an adventure in nature. Renting a mountain bike is cheap. I recommend to plan a full day trip if you want to visit the whole island.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Trials for mountain biking is very nice and so is most of the island, yet there is alot of trash on the island and the beaches"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Here is a good place for family bonding. We can enjoy the natural and good exercise.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,The only place in Singapore where you can go back in time for a rustic experience.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Be sure to bring cash!
As early as 7am, there are boats into pulau ubin from Changi jetty. Last boat leaves at 7pm but be sure to check at the jetty. You can cycle or get a private hire on the island to go around. Bring sufficient sunblock and water to have a great trip!  Avoid eating and walking to not attract wildlife including wild boars and monkies. Local says that wild boar nearer to OBS can be really aggressive - do not provoke!
Great place for family to explore Singapore on the weekend and can see the settlements in early Singapore - kampung life. Amazing place that should be preserved!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Fun day riding around rented bikes at Pulau Ubin. Nice scenery and good photo opportunities. Love it, will be back!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pretty peaceful island. This is good place for everyone. Children learn village and island teen ages good for ur cycling and Walk relax breathing fresh air , senior people breathe fresh air good for they health . Inside famous Chinese temple little far choice rental bicycle or car . Must bring drink water and Singapore money this place no ATM . Here very good bathroom speciality"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place for kayaking !
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Perfect place to get away for a while from bustling Singapore. Paid only SGD3 one way to reach here. Lots of activities to do for 'back to nature' experiences, my favourite was biking whilst enjoying forest atmosphere. Don't eat nearby monkeys or leave your belonging in the bicycle basket since we almost lost my bag stole by them lol. Strongly suggest to stay overnight at campsites. There're 3 yet we chose one in Mamam campsites since it's less crowded and close to the restroom. Sleeping under the sky with sound of sea waves is reason I'll go back here!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Just a short boat ride from Changi ferry point is as close as you can get to nature. Trekking and biking opportunities for all levels. Interesting stops at a secluded museum, monkeys & squirrels sighting on the trails and a mangrove swamp ""chek jawa"". Amenities are very basic with only minimal food and drinks available. Best to pack your own if you want to spend a day there."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"People there are so friendly. U wont feel stranger in the place. We had an early biking,walking,hiking session with friends..😊 brought some food for brekky took it on top of butterfly hill 😊
Absolutely wonderful place!!!☺"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Very nice place to stay for a day. Enjoy the food   In the village. You can rent bicycles for 7 dollars. Very Wilde place where you can see monkeys and snakes quite easily. ;-)   Boat for 12 people more or less every 10 min. For 3 dollars. I recommend
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"I think Pulau Ubin is the best of the Natural Place in Singapore. In Pulau Ubin haven’t ATMs and public transportations.. if you’re need to travel around the Pulau Ubin so you have to buy a bicycle for rent it’s price normally $5 to $8. That’s the best way for the travel in Pulau Ubin. Further you must come out from Pulau Ubin before 6pm .because after 6 pm haven’t any boats to SG.please remember don’t leave any plastic or rubbish in the island only keep you foot prints , god bless you !"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,One of the best fishing spot in singapore and beautiful nature landscape.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place for a quick get away from Singapore’s hustle and bustle. Awesome for Cycling too.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Rustic and very unlike the typical image of cosmopolitan Singapore. A great place to get close to nature and enjoy the outdoor.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"To get to pulau ubin you have to take a bum boat at Changi Ferry Terminal to get it. It costs around $5 one way for 1 Person and 1 Bike the same to get back to Singapore, the ferry terminal opens at 7am and closes at 7pm.

Positive:
A Blast To the past of Singapore, where you get to see many things that are similar to what you see in Singapore, at the jetty entrance you can rent a bike (they will give helmets for free). The biking experience was nice, with many dirt roads and loose rocks, good for those looking for a challenge. You can try the Ketam Mountain Biking trail if you dare :) . You also can find many information signs, with information on the history of the place there. For hiking, I'm not really sure of it.

Negatives:
There is quite an amount of trails that lead to ""dead ends""( there is a way, you just have to find it) and if you find the wrong one you might get chased by an animal and fall down. There are many dangerous creatures from wild boars to snakes. So be carefull

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Good place for a pic-nic during weekend when you stay in Singapore
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,It's a beautiful island which you can ferry for 3 dollars one way. You have to go to Changi village via bus. It's has beautiful spots and also cycling option available. Must go

I would recommend to rent the bicycle and explore the island."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Ideal place for a Sunday getaway with family and friends. A short ferry ride from changi village will take you to this Island. Has Biking and hiking trails.One of the very few places in the world where you can find straw headed bulbuls. Lots of rental shops to rent bicycles.You can find few restaurants. No Indian food.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Perfect stress buster
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,There was track for downhill but be carefull for a pig haha make sure you rental bycicle good
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"As others have said, great place to see a different side of Singapore!

Pros
- wild animals, especially cute baby boars 🙂. In this respect Pulau Ubin is more interesting than eg Macritchie trail!
- nice mangrove and coastal walks

Cons
- restaurants did not look very appealing
- quite a bit of trash in the mangrove forest and along the coast (no doubt brought there by the waves)
- difficult to get to!

Overall I would probably recommend this over Macritchie if you have time and are interested in wildlife 🙂"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,One of the few untouched nature island in Singapore
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,A place for those who love nature
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,good for one day getaway
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place to be off the grid, and be adventurous into the nature, this island is one of the last kampung area from the mainland, it used to have granite queries within the most parts of the island, good place to go with friends or family for hikes or cycling along the island. Love it's old school vibe though.

Last visited: Went there on 16 Dec with my aunt and wife for a hike at west side of the island, I must say most of the kampungs has been removed to make way for preserving back to its natural state, love it’s wild life and natural environment, but I’m missing it’s old school vibe from the last time I visited, pretty much alot has changed. Since covid came along, these islanders had no choice but to move to the mainland. Overall love the hiking."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"We had a visitor from UK who loves nature so where should we go but the rustic and authentic Pulau Ubin, where you can step back in time to when Singaporeans lived in kampongs and packs of stray dogs ran around scavenging for food.
We made a stop at Mizzy's corner in Changi Village for nasi lemak (coconut rice with chicken wing/fish and ikan bilis) and some goreng pisang (fried banana) before taking the 10-min  bumboat ride across. It's S$3 if there're 12 people. Just have to wait till the number is met. We had 9 after half an hour so we paid $5 each. The boatman told us there would be a Teochew opera after 7pm for temple goers and the ride back would then be free. Good deal.
After disembarking, a van driver Ah Teck offered to drive us to the Chek Jawa broadwalk for $12 one way. Seeing as it was 5pm and CJ closed at 6pm we decided to also book him for the ride back at $12 too. It was a great decision. Thoroughly enjoyed the broadwalk.
Ah Teck helped us to collect rubber seeds fallen on the road, pointed out fruit trees and stopped for us to take pictures. We also walked to the village headman's house to take a look and at 7.15pm, heard the Wayang starting. The distinctive wail of Chinese instruments and Teochew singing drew us to the stage. Our UK guest was fascinated by Nick Shen's Tok Tok Chiang troupe and tried to decipher the storyline from the actions. Artist Tung Yue Nang was executing his wonderful Chinese ink drawing while the wayang/opera was proceeding. He captured all the bystanders and atmosphere so well. The drawing seemed alive.
After almost an hour of wayang, we caught the bumboat back to mainland. The evening was rounded off with wonderful beer at Charlie's Corner and bbq chicken wings which CC kindly allowed us to order from the stalls. Perfect food combo and perfect day out. Burp! ;)"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,an ok place if you want to escape from the hectic singapore life. They offer a variety of seafood and a rental bike to enjoy cycling around the island. If you want to come to this place you must cross from changi point jetty.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Weekend days nice place to time pass
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,The island to the northeast of Singapore is the only place to see an example of the traditional kampong villages that once covered the city-state. The atmosphere and environment takes you away from the busy city. A place to escape the hectic; fast pace city.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Away from bustling city
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Loved visiting this chilled out little island, such a contrast to the hustle and bustle of the mainland.
Recommendations:
- Hire bikes to cycle around the island. The bikes aren’t the newest or highest of quality (but very cheap to rent) so make sure you test it out for functionality (gears and seat) before taking off.
- Ditch the bike at points to take some of the marked walks and enjoy the beautiful lush foliage and wildlife. We didn’t come across any monkeys but saw large lizards, wild pigs and loads of butterflies.
- Take mosquito repellent. We found the Tiger Balm patches to be very effective and can buy from most convenience stores.
- Enjoy some fresh coconuts from the village or roadside stalls, can’t beat them!

The only downside was that when we were wanting to leave the island we had to wait for around an hour. The bum boats don’t have a fixed schedule and only depart when they have a set number of people (around 12). Working by island time for a day is quite nice though, so make sure you don’t need to hurry back for something."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great experience for people who don't want to leave Singapore but want to see something new on the weekend
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Peaceful, calm. Nice weekend getaway amidst the nature."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin makes for a great day out from the concrete jungle that Singapore is. Not too many tourists venture there which makes it for a peaceful and adventurous experience. You can go there from anywhere in Singapore to the jetty near Changi airport and the boat ride takes about 10min.
I rent a bicycle for just a few $$ and the whole island can be done in a few hours. There are some cool animals such as wild boars and the nature here is simply amazing. Good seafood options as well in case you're hungry.
Highly recommend spending half a day here if you want to see the 'other' Singapore."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Still open to public during this period?
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Good place for a day escape in the City. Ferry takes only a few minutes. Can negotiate with the bike rent price
Place let's you discover and see new things like huge lake of lilies, pineapple plants, old cool bridges, wide view of islands, etc. It's not boring and tiring."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,A Great Islet to spend a healthier choice of activities with families and friends over the weekends. Cycle. Hike. Get Close to Nature. Experience kampong lifestyle of an older Singapore. :D
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"I hope they keep this place as it is - rustic, calm and peaceful.   Its a very nice outing for the family."

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,This is really really very beautiful and enjoyable place. 🚲 Running is mostly enjoyable.

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Small island off Singapore. Nice sea. Nice trees. Can see different kinds of flora and fauna.

A good escape away from the city life. Didn't manage to tour the whole island. Probably only half the island in a day? Very exhausting to cycle as there are a lot of slopes. Be careful when cycling on the slopes. Quite dangerous as the slopes are very steep."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Dense forest 🌳 area ... Nature rich and calm place to visit 😍

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"It's a good place for anyone who want to go for cycling and walking or even jogging in the nature with friends or family where you can't get it in the city so once in a while ,it's well recommend. The fare was 4sgd per boat trip. Renting bicycle I mean a decent bike will cost 15sgd. Took about 3-4 hours to complete the island by bicycle.
If you're lucky you'll be able to find some animals like wild boar, monkeys, birds or even snakes ."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Love nature hikes
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pretty awesome place, I imagine it’s retained the personality that has been lost through the modernization of Singapore. Definitely check prices on the bike rentals, they can vary significantly.  It gets hot and a bit hilly so bring plenty of water, will need to go again as only able to see a small portion. Avoid the big seafood restaurant, rather grab something at one of the smaller local places. Be ready to see wild boars and monkeys. Awesome day."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Zero stress on Pulau Ubin
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Island nature getaway just a short ferry trip away (from Changi Point Ferry Terminal). An inexpensive place to see the natural habitat of Singapore which is now lost to development.

Chek Java is a beautiful nature hub too!"

Due to safety distancing of pandemic the boat ride should only fetch 9 passengers with $4 each,  while they are not really comply to this rule,  there are still 12 passengers on the bot but the price is $4 each. The bike rental seem like double up of normal weekend, we rent a bike(1 rider) which looks more new and better,  it cost us $30 per day.  It is unexpected costy short trip."

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place to spend the day. Only big investment will be the cost of Taxi to Changi point ferry terminal if you are not living in the East coast. We spent half a day as a family. Two kids aged 10.5 and 7. We biked for the most part. Really nice tracks and most parts are covered by the canopy. We got there by 8am and spent a nice 3.5 hours. Will do it again for sure

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Wonderful place to get out of the hustle and bustle of the mainland. Rustic charm. Great place for cycling or hiking. Tickets to Pulau Ubin costs just $3. As expected, there's no ATM on the island, so do withdraw beforehand. Sadly, the chalet there has closed it doors. So your only overnight option is to set up a camp."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great rustic place. Boat ride $3. Lots to see and do. Friendly people. Feels very relaxing just stepping onto the island.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,It’s a great place to ride bikes. The whole tour may cost 2hours and a lot of ups and downs. 6 sgd boat fee for go and back plus 6 sgd for the bike
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Simple natural view around this island, may feel disappointed if you have high expectation. Great things come with surprises in this place, such as funny camping students with heavy bags moving and laughing around, and wild monkeys and pigs gathering in some hidden corners. What you need here is pay some attention and time to discover all these little but pretty good wonders!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Nice reserve nature place

Please visit with family and friends and enjoy the calm atmosphere away from the city noise and relax for the day. Must visit place with family and friends.."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place to experience a little of nature. Ample toilet or washing up facilities on the island. Lots of maps to show where you are. Take the path indicated grey for easy walk or cycle. Path indicated orange is moderately ok to walk or cycle but can be difficult on wet days because of the soil and pebbles. Bring lots of insect repellents! And coins to buy drinks via vending machine.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Ketam bike park awesome
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Lovely scenery. If you're planning to cycle around the island, CHOOSE YOUR RIDE WISELY. Many of the bikes are really old and this could be spoil your entire experience."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Pulau Ubin offers natural habitat to the flora and fauna of Singapore. It still has the kampung feeling when you step onto this island. It has a vast of history to uncover if you like to dig into it. Sight seeing is the best here with a bicycle. You may want to paddle around the island on a canoe. It is the best experience.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,3,Good place . Room for lot of improvement inside the island in terms of facilities like transportation etc
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great way to see a different part of Singapore. Rent a bike and explore!

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"This was one of the highlights of Singapore for me. Cycling around the island listening to birds and insects singing was awesome. Saw some monkeys, lizards and some type of wild pig as well. Sitting in the main village after a humid cycle and enjoying sweet coconut milk was a treat. Worth the trip if you have time. Bring water and a hat."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,I love  to go there & 3 times already but not enough🤩
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Very nice for travelling to here, tourist place visit for photo shoot,you can renting cycle for ride with friends or family or kids to this island, its border of singapore beside the sea malaysia border, here food or renting room for stay bit price higher, its very near to tampines singapore, better carry ur own food,ziploc bag for trash  drinks,tent, you need to use boat( less than $10 for two ways) to travel from tampines,"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"It is a nice place to have fun, relaxation or adventure with friends,  families or kids.  Nature lovers can enjoy the nature or people who like adventure can go for cycling.  People can bring in their own cycles also. If kids like to cycle try to be cautious when cycling in unpaved path.
Water bottles or food can be bought at the entrance from the shops and there are vending machines and water dispensers at come locations.  It is better to carry first aid kit if you are traveling with young active kids."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Bike riders lovers
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,An island for nature lovers be it cycling. Hiking. Camping. Spend a day here when you are in Singapore if you like outdoors
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Fantastic experience. Offers a rare insight into what Singapore was like before colonization
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Place was very good for nature trekking and exploring.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place to escape the city life of Singapore. The line to get onto a ferry to get off island was quite long, so go early! Eat before and bring water. If you do bring food, please be aware the monkeys can tear through the red plastic bags. Bring an umbrella."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Wild boars,wild monkeys. Some where you might wanna go during your holidays."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,An excellent place for nature lovers. U can either  walk or rent a bicycle to explore this beautiful island. Good place to enjoy your weekend with less budget. Local people are friendly.And finally don't forget to try out the yummy thai coconut ice cream :)
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Beautiful island and a great place to unwind. There is a lot of green. There are bicycles for rent if you want to cycle around the island.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Away from the city life.. peace and tranquility
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place for weekend trips
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Amazing island! Went on a weekday, not busy at all. Ran into a group of monkeys twice while biking through the wetlands. Also saw an iguana, multiple wild boar and a whip snakeWithin the mountain bike park, trails are mostly singletrack, steep, narrow, technical, rocky, and often slick from the rain."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Has a extensive network of nature trails filled with wildlife. You get to experience the real natural feeling of living in the wilderness
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place to visit for nature in Singapore! Take a bumboat from changi village ($3, one way) and ride for maybe 5mins. You can explore the island on foot or cycle. Both are manageable though keep in mind there are some steep slopes if you're cycling. Good views everywhere and sights you will not see on the main island easily."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Nice kampung (village) feel intact. With durian trees around.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,A great place to visit to unwind. Had a great time touring around with friends by cycling on a rainy day. A quick nap at the pondok while waiting for the rain to ease. A hike up the observatory tour was absolutely worth it when we were welcomed by great views.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Fantastic place to enjoy nature. If you have a chance bring your family friends girlfriend and enjoy... ;)
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Rent a bike for $10 for the whole day and just go out and explore Singapore's untouched treasure. You'll see everything from Monkeys to Wild Boar to old Malay tombstones to ant colonies to mini crabs to exotic birds to untouched vegetation.  Palau Ubin is, simply put, a national treasure. All Singaporeans should visit it at least once in their lives just to remind themselves how far the country has come in just fifty years!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,3,Not really a fan of outdoors but the toilets really need maintenance and cleaning. There is one who offers clean toilets near the entrance for 5sgd.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Taste of real nature life near Singapore and trekking is very convenient
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,1,"Don't be persuaded by the photos of this island. It is a hot, humid, mosquito-infested island. It should developed for residential and recreational purposes. It shows on the map that there is a beach on the Northern coast. THERE IS NOT. Beware the monkeys are agressive and will not hold back. There are also many lizards and snakes and other scary insects that may attack. - I fractured my back when I was there, my advice would be to stay well away. (Unless you want to go mountain biking)"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Compared to the manicured, sterile Singapore, this is a nice chance of wild, untended nature just a short $S3 ferry away: You can rent cycles from between $10 -  $20 for the whole day, and you can get a good day's cycling, walking and exploring out of it.

There is also a mountain bike trail with varying degrees of difficulty on the west section of the island, so if you're into mountain biking you can whittle away an afternoon cycling down sheer cliffs and across rocky clearings (don't take a tandem like we tried)"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,The only Island that preserve the old kampung style.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,A getaway from city life to a more laid back enviroment. Well almost... :)
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"A really awesome place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city life.
Would recommend to bring extra money like $100+ as there are no atm.
If you would like to explore the whole area in one day, I would recommend you to rent one of the better bikes instead of those cheaper one because it would really help in the long run with the numerous uphill battles you are going to encounter.
Can't wait to go there again!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"One of the most rustic island in Singapore where you can see wildlife running around.

There are limited transport, a couple of taxis, in the island. It is a nice place to hike, cycling and have a walk if you are natural lovers.

Please bring sufficient cash, plenty of water and food if you like to visit this island. There are only shops and bicycle rental at the entrance of the island. Get yourself arms with insect repellent to fight against insects such as mosquitoes, sandflies, spiders and others."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,came here many years ago multiple times and plan to visit again post circuit breaker 2020
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,My favourite place to visit for the past 5 -6 years whenever I'm in Singapore.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Place to visit nice tourist place
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Located away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city lies the panaromic village of Pulau Ubin. The Flora and the Fauna mesmerising. Even a days visit to this beautiful location charges one up and one longs to visit this place time and again. The fifteen minute ferry ride soothes one's soul. Are you ready for a visit ? Ubin beckons you.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,2,Nothing too special!!! I would say there is better parks in singapore to visit like mcRichi
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Amazing change of scenery for anyone visiting singapore

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"A very green place
Lovely view
The food a bicycle riding was fun"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,This place is a must to everyone visit Singapore. Rent a bicycle and explore this small island. Drive through the jungle paths all the way to Chek Jawa be careful of the monkeys and the wild pigs. See the gorgeous lakes and much more... I loved it and will come again.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Amazing Island, like a paradise!"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,2,"For the first time going to Pulau Ubin my expectation were very high. I thought that there would be colourful plants and many animals. Unfortunately the day I spent at Pulau Ubin was very underwhelming. Perhaps I do not appreciate the outdoors as much as others do but from what I had seen, the variety of flora and fauna was very lacklustre. I was also expecting a certain level of unique culture present on the island. It seemed very similar to other kampongs and villages I had seen in my life which did not make it very special for me. Please only visit if you are very interested in plants."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Very nice place for hiking.always very clean singapore village
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place to spend a day and see nature while biking. Food options are limited so being a snack or picnic. Didn't come during low tide but probably would be even more pretty on the water then. Contrary to what you may read, there are vans on the island but they are for helping folks who may not be able to hike or bike and are reasonably priced."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Most natural place in Singapore. I like it
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,I was happy foe the first vesit the amazing place Pulao ubin..its very nice place relaxing ..some more cycling experiece nice view..its my unforgetale moment...i think its only only a dreams burvirs comesvtrue..ill be back again soon.with my groupz friends👪👬💑🏊🚢🚴🚴
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Surreal experience. Contrast to Singapore's concrete jungle, it is a perfect getaway for a day. There are camping sites on the island, but I've heard camping here could be challenging. Make your way down to Changi Ferry Point Terminal from where you take a bumboat across to the island. A one way ticket costs SGD 3. Once you reach the island, rent a cycle and cycle your heart out across the island. Depending on the type of cycle, the prices vary. (10 dollar and above) Cycle only if you are physically fit because the slopes are really challenging, even for fit people. There is a beautiful boardwalk through the mangroves. It's a must visit. Try not to roam around with food unless you want to get attacked by monkeys."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Great place relax, last village of Singapore, seafood and cycling is what i doing here"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,My best place in Singapore..All the Torest ar please just 1 time visiting here and enjoy beautiful Singapore
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Love the bicycle rides
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Great place for cycling and getting back to the nature.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"ulau Ubin, also simply known as Ubin, is an island situated in the north east of Singapore, to the west of Pulau Tekong. Granite quarrying supported a few thousand settlers on Pulau Ubin in the 1960s, but only about a hundred villagers live there today. It is one of the last rural areas to be found in Singapore, with an abundance of natural flora and fauna. The island forms part of the Ubin–Khatib Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened.[2]"
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Good for bike riding and away from city
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,1,I will give it one star just for the very reason that uncle the guy who was n charged there asked me to wait for the next bumpboat.He said i came late.Tho i seated there first.Maybe the other guy pay him more still i don't fell good about it.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,This is my favourite place in Singapore
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"You pay 3 S$ for a boat ride from Changi point to Pulau Ubin. (back it is 3 S$ again)
It was a 10 to 15 minute boatride.
At the starting point you can rent bicycles, but you also can walk to Check Jawa Wetlands.
The nature is beautifull and there is a lot of wildlife!
Iff you want to escape from busy Singapore, this is the place to be."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Close to nature
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,3,Been their once for a one day tour.  Wot return. The only place in sg with village living.
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"You would not expect to find a place like Palau Ubin in the city state of Singapore!  We lived in Singapore in 2004.  However, we were little aware of this gem of tiny island off the eastern coast of Singapore. It is a very short distance away from the main island. You can reach the island by boat from Changi village ferry terminal - one way ticket costing SD 2. The boat service has no definite time table. When 12 people are there waiting for the boat it will leave. It will not operate after 5 30 pm. There are facilities for overnight stay on the island. There are a few restaurants serving traditional food on the island. There are a number of attractions on the island including the unique wetlands that's ideal for photography. Numerous water birds, crabs, mud skippers, butterflies make it their habit in here. There's a separate butterfly hill home to many species. To reach the far corners of the island there are three options, namely, walking cycling and taking taxi (van). One day is not enough to see the whole island. The bigger animals include the monkey and the wild boar. You should keep your distance from the wild boar that can be dangerous. You can get a glimpse of traditional village (kampong)  living of olden day Singapore by visiting this island."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,"Great escape from the city but not recommended to stay overnight. Getting onto the island is simple, just go to Changi Village and hop on a bum-boat ride. Bicycles are available for rent on the island. Island is not very big but is beautiful. Can be hot in the afternoon. Rocky paths along Chek Jawa Wetlands. Filled with cemeteries. Check out Pulau Ubin's history before going."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Palau Ubin is a great place to spend your weekend in Singapore. It's 10 minutes boat ride from Changi beach park.

SGD3 per one way ride for one person. You can pay at the boat.

It's an small island and can be explored by foot or cycles. There are several bicycle rental shops near the entrance. We were able to get mountain bikes for SGD15 which were okay. You can buy bit newer ones for SGD18 and higher. Also there are double bicycles and cycles which can carry children as well.

Also inside the island there is a taxi van service as well.

It's easy to find road since there are maps and markers everywhere. It has some fascinating views. Don't forget to go to wetland area."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Nice place for everyone
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"An awesome island just 10mins in ferry from Changi Village, Singapore
The island is just around 10mins in ferry from Changi Village. There is no fixed timings for ferry. Whenever there are 12ppl , they take the ferry . One way fare is 3SGD. If you are in a hurry , you can pay for the 12 seats and take the ferry immediately. After reaching the island there are bicycles for rent and also if you are not fit enough for that , you can take a van to see the island. But i would suggest to take the bicycle. Bicycle rent starts from 6SGD to around 16SGD. For 8SGD you a could get a fairly good one. Chek Java is the best place to be in the island . So better you cycle to chek java first and then go to other places if you got the energy. Chek Java is around 3.5kms from the place where you take the bicycles. You could spend around 3hrs in this island."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"Pulau Ubin is just a short boat ride from the Changi Ferry Terminal, the island offers very reasonable bike rental rates, quite a few rustic restaurants, lush jungle trails, beautiful flora and fauna along with captivating waterfront views."
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,4,Singapore Island with nature trail
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Nice facilities
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,Nice experience in this island
Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"The best local getaway away from Singapore. Pulau Ubin is the last frontier and anyone will be transported back to how it was a couple of decades back. Get to Changi jetty real early to beat the weekend crowds (7.30am is a sweet spot). Better still, go on a weekday. Be mindful of the last ferry back to mainland (5.30pm on weekdays and up to 6.30pm on weekend) to be safe, else it is a ""chartered boat ride $36).

There are 5 bicycle shops offering a myrad of bicycles to choose from. I personally prefer the ladies bike if your intentions is to just cycle around. It is just easier on the posture and hey, its cool.

Muslim visitors need to be aware that there are no halal certified establishments on the island.

Head west to Puaka Hill - an amazing view of the strait between Punggol and Pasir Gudang and the green abandoned quary water. Further west is a mountain bike trail for the adventourous. East of the island is a protected area called ""Chek Jawa"" where you walk amongst mangrove trees. The tide is a major factor this place exist as the sand banks stretch out far during low tides. The Jejawi tower is a must visit when in Chek Jawa area to catch a glimpse of eagles circling around.

Carry plenty of insecticides for the mosquitos are unforgiving, better still just wear long sleeeves. Do watch out when carrying plastic bags (or anything colourful) as monkeys being monkeys will snatch them away.

Camping is allowed but the island really come to a stand still after dark - one of the reason I love this place. Serene, peaceful and simply..the best."

The island’s ambience was relaxing and calm, we just roam around and took a nap in one quiet spot. Just very nice to stay in such a peaceful state even for a short time. Can also use bike to explore the island if you prefer so.
Just fun to share as well my funny and memorable experience here where I was chased by a monkey😂, so unluckily did not reach the observation tower. Definitely give me a reason to come back again✌️"

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,3,"(Translated by Google) I spent half a day from 11am to 3:30pm. I rented a bicycle and went around the island, but the bicycle is quite retro. The chain may come off, so it's a good idea to make sure the chain is loose when choosing a bike.
We recommend rucksacks instead of shoulder bags as monkeys are ferocious. A friend of mine was on a bicycle and was attacked by a monkey in the front, so I experienced a moment.
Personally, I think it is an island where you can enjoy cycling rather than trekking. (You can stop walking and walk around here and there)
There are 3 mountain biking courses, so if you like biking, you will surely enjoy it.

午前11時から午後３時半の半日を過ごしました。自転車をレンタルして島を見回りましたが、自転車はかなりレトロです。チェーンが外れることもあるので、自転車を選ぶ際はチェーンがゆるくないかの確認をお勧めします。

個人的にはトレッキングよりもサイクリングが楽しめる島に思います。(所々は自転車を止めて歩いて回ることができます)
マウンテンバイクで３つのサイクリングコースがあるので、自転車での運動が好きな方はきっと楽しめるかと思います。"

You can rent a bicycle on the island for 5 yuan a day.

Some small animals can be seen on the island.
There are also many people who come to shoot birds.

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"(Translated by Google) An island floating in the Johor Strait, northeast of the main island of Singapore. It feels like you're type-slipping into the good old days of Southeast Asia. Gravel roads, lush forests and lots of wildlife-the rainforest remains on Ubin Island. Ubin Island is home to less than 100 villagers and is truly authentic, the last ""Kampong"" in Singapore (Malay for ""village""). Or Many of the visitors to this island fall in love with the rich nature and repeat it. The 10.2 sq km island can be seen as you take off and land at Changi Airport. It looks like a ""ku"" shape and is overwhelmed by its size. Ubin Island, which means a granite island in Malay. You may see quarry traces that are no longer in use.

It smells a lot. At this time (July), durians were there, and it seems that some people cut them on the spot to eat or take them home.
There are also restaurants and kiosks on the island.
There is also a small rocky shore next to the ferry terminal, so you may come just to play on the rocky shore. There is also a trekking course, so I think that's a good purpose.

Pulau Ubin Nature and Kampong Walk,5,"(Translated by Google) An outlying island in Singapore takes about 10 minutes by boat ($4 per person). The scenery is really good and it is worth a visit.
To the island, you can rent bicycles around the island, between $8-20 new classes. I recommend the second shop that rents a bicycle. The service is good, and the chain will be replaced immediately.
⚠️ When renting a car, be sure to check the front and rear brakes and whether the tires are inflated enough. It is best to try a lap. The island is full of mountain roads and ramps.
✅ Chek Jawa has a special parking place. Walk along the way, pass the beach, walk through the boardwalk, mangroves, and go back to the original parking place (hint: the bicycle does not need to be locked) There are signs on the road, follow along Won't get lost
✅ Puaka Hill also parked the car on the side of the road and climbed the hill to the top along the road, and you will see the scenery of the entire mine lake

The Jawa Wetlands were the absolute highlight. The many planes there could disturb. Then we went to the Mountain Bike Park and tried the blue tours. Was an experience!

Changi Point Boardwalk,5,First time went to this place on 3oth July 2021 during evening to see the sunset. Unfortunately it was windy and couldn't see the sunset. But the place attracted me so much that I went there again on 31st early morning to see the sunrise. Its one of my favorite place now in Singapore.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Intend to come here picnic for next visit after seen the beach scenery..
Changi Point Boardwalk,3,"Part of the boardwalk is closed for repairs and hence is a dead end. Apart from that, it's very pleasant to walk around Changi Village and the surrounding area."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Love the beautiful sea view. You'll enjoy a quiet, calm and relaxing stroll along the sea whether early morning or evening."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"great place to walk about and admire the scenery. not too crowded and its also a great photo spot to capture the sunrise or sunset. Just check the weather forecast before hand because if it rains, there aren't many publicly available shelters nearby."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Nice place for a peaceful and natural stroll..quiet with a lot of nature around - trees, sea etc. Keep a mosquito repellent though. Some people do fishing there. Stay away during rain as water level rises and can be dangerous."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"I love going for runs during weekends, and this place had been in my hit list for quite sometime now. And I was so glad once i reached.

The place is so beautiful that it distracted me along my entire run, as I had to stop and click pictures. Plus the sun was setting and the weather was perfect.

Once you reach the end of the broad walk, there is the Changi Village Hawker Center where u can go and relish some food."

Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Part of the Boardwalk is closed when I walked there last Sunday, but there are still places to explore. I ended up on the side of Changi beach where I spotted a mud crab, a dizzy fish close to the water's edge and a horseshoe crab !"
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Although some parts is closed for upgrading works. There's plenty of scenic shots that could be found along the beach.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Nice place to have a walk.
Changi Point Boardwalk,2,Many blockages that spoilt our evening stroll.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Excellent mind blowing place I never visit like this beautiful place. It's really amazing
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Wonderful experience with sandy beach rocky shores and even a segment of rainforest. Encountering the hornbills in the latest habitat made up for the cloudy but cool weather.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Beautiful place. Only downside is going at the wrong time. Construction ongoing at parts of the boardwalk

Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Good place for strolling
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Visited 05/09/2020
Beautiful quiet place to view the sea but its a raining day so no sunset :(
The boardwalk is close due to a damage handrails at the middle of the boardwalk.
Place accessible only via car"
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,We walked the entire stretch to the SAF Ferry Terminal and saw lots of cyclists and walkers along the way. Completed the breezy morning with breakfast at Changi Village Hawker Centre.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Nice boardwalk along the coastline of Singapore. The sea breeze is cool, so it doesn't feel as hot as on inland. You can walk all the way to Changi Beach Park and eat there.
There are many private club houses along the boardwalk, and practically no public amenities, like restrooms.
The location is a bit far from the city, so we took a cab. But it is worth the visit."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,A quiet and relax place that you could spent 1 - 2 hours there. Recommended!
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Good place to reflect and be at peace with yourself. Especially peaceful during the weekdays
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Nice location and views of beach. Suggest to visit at Sunset. Part of boardwalk is under renovation so you can access only a small part.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Lovely scenic place to visit.lovely views and the smell of the sea make it an excellent place for a walk
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Beautiful place to hang out. Good place for a long stroll. Catch a perfect sunset here. Peaceful but isolated, nearest busstop a long way out. The place to visit if you book a nearby chalet. Awesome jetty, awesome views! Scenic walk. Relaxing place. Very quiet to sit down. Good for family and couples."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Very tranquil & open area so make sure to bring an umbrella. Beautiful & windy place but apart from fishing there’s not much to do. Except maybe to catch up with friends or a mini picnic
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Breezy with lots of greenery.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Love the quiet walk by the water. Good for self reflection or a nice slow conversation with a loved one.
Changi Point Boardwalk,3,"Nice morning walk with friends and enjoying cool and decent weather , little rainy too but its ok as i like rain walk.
Have a cup of coffee during morning walk is ultimate exp.
Nice view pics."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Definitely one of the best places to watch sunsets here in Singapore.
☀️
Just be sure to arm yourself with ample citronella or lemongrass to ward off unwanted pests. Or at the very least, wear some good ol' Coppertone.
🦟
I heard it said once before that sunsets are God's signature and that every one is different!
📝
So as I stood there during the golden hour gazing at the ball of fire, I gave up trying to recall how it looked like the day before. I am convinced and contented to know that it was more beautiful.
🌞
I stayed till the brilliant hues disappeared beyond the horizon, feeling kinda helpless as I witnessed the eventual close of yet another glorious day.
🌅
But soon enough, I was back again, and again to have that same soulful experience."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"The 2.2km broadwalk offers gorgeous views of both the sunrise and sunset. If you reach at 6.45pm to The sunset broadwalk, you can see the contrasting colours of the evening sky, with the sun disappearing into the distant horizon.
Nice environment, cool breeze, and so peaceful, you will see the awesome sunset."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Good if you would like to enjoy a breezy walk along the Changi Coast. You will also walk pass a sailing club where you can see

The starting point is not car friendly as there are no public carpark available. Therefore, best option to start point is public transport + about 10 mins of walking.

Generally not wheelchair accessible as there are quite a number of steps along the way."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Nice place 👍 and you can relax here very stable no one disturb you.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Some difficulties with parking and is more accessible via driving. Can park at the roadside but will risk getting a ticket for illegal parking offence. The broad walk is very long 1km plus and can walk all the way to Changi beach. The place is tranquil and windy. trekking is pretty easy. The broad walk is clean and the scenery is beautiful. It is the kelong walk maybe wheelchair accessible but the other portion of the broad walk is not. It is not a sheltered broad walk hence avoid going during monsoon season.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"It is at the end of changi village, the sun rise n sunset is a must c scenery. It is also a place for family to gather or fishing together to catch with friends. Sometimes u might come across monkeys."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Great, nice walk great views with a nice breeze of the sea."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Sunset view. Must see. Beautiful view.

Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Enjoyed my walk very much, beautiful view"
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Nice walk and another plus point is that it is near to Changi village hawker Centre where there is a lot of good food.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Taking a stroll on the boardwalk is always a nice way to relax with the sea view along the way...
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,Nice place to get sunset shots
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"Pleasant walk, not much stairs or steps. Go when there's natural light as the paths are not very well lit (the lamp post are quite far apart in some area)."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"The Broadwalk starts from Changi Beach Club, can be access by Cranwell Road. Evening is the best time to take a stroll along the Broadwalk, you will be rewarded with great sunset views. You will end your walk at Changi Point Ferry Terminal which is very near to the Hawker Centre.
During the Covid19 Circuit Breaker period I think because lesser people movement Nature takes over. I was greeted by White Parrots, Pink Parrots, Dancing Birds, Monitor Lizards, Crane etc.
A great place to enjoy nature!"
Changi Point Boardwalk,1,Its closed still!
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Nice scenic view of the sea, feels like you are in a different part of the world. Good place to have a picnic with loved ones, or there is a restaurant that offers Chinese food. As you can see, there were many fishermen nearby waiting for fish to bite. Didn't get the chance to witness anyone reeling in a catch but I guess you can always try! Unable to reach this place without a vehicle, I suggest taking a bus then hoping into a cab. Otherwise, it will be a very long and confusing walk."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Nice breeze and if you like to walk along seaside, you shouldn't miss it."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Fishermen boardwalk. Nice seas view.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"PEACEFUL, SUNSET, EVENING, STROLLS, FISHING, DATING, SEA BREEZE, TAKE A WALK TO CHANGI VILLAGE HAWKER CENTRE TO EAT FAMOUS NASI LEMAK AND OTHER DELICACIES! Dont forget to try the Malacca Chendol too!!!!!!!!"
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,"It's very quiet area in the east where you can enjoy a nice beach walk. If you are looking to get away from the crowd, then look no further. Its a short walk along the bridges. Lack of amenities like toilet or drinking water station that make this place less favourable to stay for long."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,One of the best place to experience sunset in Singapore with family or friends. Remember to carry water to keep you hydrated
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,It's a nice broadwalk. Windy. There are many sailing boats around as there is a club there. It will be a bit inconvenient if you don't drive and there's no parking place near there. The nearest parking lot is a discount away. But it is a good place to catch the beautiful sunset.
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Nice walk along the coastal. Good for photoshoot sunrise and sunset. Difficult to travel by public.
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"Lovely time with nature, uncrowded and peaceful for reflection"

Changi Point Boardwalk,3,"It's a little worse for the wear and crowded, and the beach isn't great but I like the rustic air and it's sufficiently wheelchair friendly."
Changi Point Boardwalk,5,"A nice, relatively quiet path to do a leisure stroll. I find the western parts of the walk nice and quiet with better scenery. The last time I was here I remember there wasn't so many boats moored along this stretch of the sea. Well, times have changed."
Changi Point Boardwalk,4,Very suitable for couple or family to take a walk at weekend. Not many people there. We took only 25-30 mins to get Changi Village Market. Although the water is not very clean

Some people spend the whole  weekend fishing along the way. Can see the family having a picnic on the Boardwalk. Young couples having their wedding photo  shooting here. The background is so beautiful and natural, with blue sky and big ships sailing across. The breeze and the sound of the wave add the great pleasure to  your mind and soul. Feeling relax after strolling from one end to  another.

Kent Ridge Park,4,"I like e nature in e morning, sounds from birds n shipyards really make it wonderful🐦❤️🌹🌞"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Great hilly climbs and shady areas for walks. Great views on the top. Connected to the Hort Park.  2 Small public  parking areas if you are driving here.  The greenery and nature reserve here is beautiful…. See the naturally grown orchids in my photos!?  Absolutely beautiful!! I’m so glad they are growing so high up in the tree so people can leave the orchid plants and flowers alone.  So they can bloom and grow in peace and we nosey undeserving humans can happily admire and oooh-&-aaaah from afar.
Enjoy!"
Kent Ridge Park,5,Nature Walk at itz Best!
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Connected to hort park, there are 4 parking lots around.  There is a canopy walk, two ponds, and an open green landscape on the canopy walk.  It is recommended not to go uphill from the side of hort park, otherwise it will be uphill all the way."
Kent Ridge Park,4,"Nice place to stroll and enjoy a beautiful sunset however, quite crowded on a public holiday (National Day). Hence, picnicking overwhelmed the trash bins!"
Kent Ridge Park,3,"Nice and quite not much people, it took me about one and a half hour to complete, some photos taken from tree top canopy."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"A beautiful and charming park that looks like those you see in Europe, Canada and NZ. Quite small. It has 4 car parks. Two accessible from South Buona Vista Road and two accessible from Pasir Panjang.

This park has a canopy boardwalk that leads downhill to another beautiful Hort Park which is connected to the Southern Ridges boardwalk that will take you all the way to either Labrador Nature Park or Harbourfront, Vivo City and Sentosa."
Kent Ridge Park,5,Its a quiet nature park. Always like the quiet and get to hear the nature sound - leaf and birds. Get to Hort Park by the Canopy Walk and enjoy the scenery.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Came here on a relatively cloudy afternoon, quiet with few people. We entered from science park, walked past the pond, the canopy walk, and exited to pasir panjang road. It was an easy paved trail with some steps, took less than an hour at strolling speed. No picturesque view, just nice to be in the wilderness for a while, away from the bustling city ☺️"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Easy pathway and very accessible. What we like about this place is all the matured tress seems to be dancing and swaying to welcome us with its brunches. It’s easy, pleasant & shady walk."

More importantly the Park is clean and people are cheerful."
Kent Ridge Park,4,"Well done.
NATIONAL Park....
Fresh air.
Greener garden everywhere...
Safe boardwalk....
Fantastic views...."
Kent Ridge Park,4,Very nice park with relaxing spots to sit down and read
Kent Ridge Park,4,"Good for a walk or jog. Nice greenery and views. Can park in Kent Ridge Park Carpark A, then walk, cycle or jog to head down hill to Hort Park. Going down is very relaxing. But do reserve enough energy go back up from Hort Park!

To venture further, one can walk from Hort Park to Henderson Park and then on to Mount Faber from here."
Kent Ridge Park,4,"Good place to do forestbathing. You may enter via hort park ,thru a canopy walk before reach kent ridge park"

Kent Ridge Park,5,"I went to Kent Ridge Park for a biking expedition with some friends down the mountain bike trail, and it was a BIG fun! Nevertheless, one can have as enjoyable a time as I did, just hiking up and down the hill; especially on the Canopy Walk, above the trees. It is picturesque, from where I stood. But if one chooses to drive up, well...really, dude, you ought to leave those petrol guzzling thing at home."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"A bit crowded on weekends, but still can find free parking.   Many nice walkways, mostly shaded by tree cover.  Nice exercise areas and machines, many places where you can picnic.

Kent Ridge Park,5,Very greenery nature park with sports facilities. So peaceful environment for all sorts of life
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Very nice park, there is a good mountain biking trail and seems like there are completion held there as well. Good walking trail and a few ponds for  a nice walk after lunch or dinner. Few parking lots as well so it is easily accessible."

Kent Ridge Park,4,"An ideal place if you are looking for calm, peaceful, less crowded park."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Small park with open space, fitness area, dragonfly pond, you can park at car park B to do a loop.

You can explore also Hortpark too"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"One of the best things about Singapore is that they can offer places such as this gem to the public for free. There's a fitness area complete with fitness apparatuses kinda like the one's used by gymnasts (don't know what are they called). The view of the city is blocked by trees but it doesn't matter because the trees themselves are beautiful. If you go here do not miss the canopy walk. Also, there is a trail exclusive for mountain bikes. Overall, I love this place."
Kent Ridge Park,5,A very nice place to be. It's very quiet.

Kent Ridge Park,5,"Nice scenery, good for gathering or picnic"

It is a peaceful and tranquil park because there are not many visitors. The views from the top is not too bad, you get to see Hort park or the sea off the south west coast of Singapore. You can get to the park from Kent Ridge station on the Circle Line by walking along Science Park Drive and look for a straight long path on the right side of the road, at the end of the path turn left and you will be at the small pond."

Kent Ridge Park,5,2016 last day excellent view of the Pasir Panjang container terminal phases 3 and 4 from the highest point of Kent Ridge Park.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Very similar to British Parks. Very long tracks linking NUS to Horton Park.

Kent Ridge Park,5,The only kanjozuku experience in singapore! Tiagong the bus drivers for the busses that goes through the 99 bends are retired racers of the first ever grand prix in singapore the gap hill climb! These extremely skilled bus drivers deserves a raise for such amazing display of skill one day singapore should hold a touge battle at the 99bends it's essentially a duplicate of One motoring japan's track!
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Beautiful n quiet park, good for exercise n relaxation"
Kent Ridge Park,4,The climb up KRP is tough... well depends what type of super bike you ride. Saw a handful of enduros enthusiasts done with the mtb trail... totally impressed by their grit (kudos).
Kent Ridge Park,5,One of my favourite place to relax here in sg. I think this is one of the place here in singapore which have big trees. You can even hear the birds chirping and insect sounds while sitting in one of the bench here.. and appreciating the breeze...
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Amazing quiet park with good views of harbor of Singapore. It's also one of the few places you can participate in recreational tree climbing. Yes, I am one of the instructors..."
Kent Ridge Park,5,Fresh air and a pretty well maintain park! Have all the facilities needed for a park albeit small.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"One of my favorite parks in Singapore.. not too hard to walk, but a god exercise. Has an awesome trail for mountain biking, a great view of harbor, free parking spots, etc. It's not overcrowded. It's not too big, but I guess this is one of those cases where the performance renders the importance of size obsolete."
Kent Ridge Park,4,"A great place for a walk, fantastic views and lots of wildlife to see. Easy to access and not too difficult to walk end to end."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Beautiful park right in the middle of Science Park Drive 1
A good place for all those working in that vicinity to relax and destress.

There is a pond, which is closer if you enter from near block 87 Science Park Drive
It is hardly a 5 minutes walk for people working in block 83-89.  It is relaxing and very serene.

One can go for a bike ride in the park.
Suggestion - walk down to the pond, sit there relax for a while then rent an ofo and go for a ride 🙂"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Had a nice walk as usual, calming and peaceful."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Love the walk along the Southern Ridges. Varied terrain, and interesting vegetation with many trees, and flowers. Start from Kent Ridge MRT, walk into Science Park, or along South Buona Vista , before turning left into Kent Ridge Park, through Hort Park, Alexandra Arch, Henderson Wave and up Mt Faber. Scenic walk, and relatively easy walk."
Kent Ridge Park,4,"Park connection - A wonderful place for individual and family morning and evening workout.
Will be good, if more CCTVs are installed here for surveillance and security purposes.

Kent Ridge Park,5,"Quiet and scenic place. Good mixture of trails and slopes. Good facilities - toilets, exercise corners etc"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Kent Ridge Park entrance from Science Park Drive may seem a bit ‘secluded’ at first. There is no proper lighting and you might not see any other people. But, as you walk through the path, you will eventually find a carpark, and the signage to both Canopy Walk and HortPark. The roads are quite steep, so you might consider to ‘conquer’ this park first, before the other parks in the Southern Ridges."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"A very beautiful place with lots of flora and fauna . Good amenities provided too such as water taps , wash rooms and benches to rest. It’s a breather amongst the hustle and bustle of the city . The dragon fly pond is a nice relaxing point . There’s a lot to explore and enjoy. Loved it."

Public amenities like toilets are in good and satiafactory conditions. Parking space are slightly limited though."
Kent Ridge Park,5,Colourful place to visit
Kent Ridge Park,5,Beautiful!
Kent Ridge Park,5,Good to go for hiking during weekdays when there are less visitors.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Not as serene or free of pollutants as it was before the port moved to Pasir Panjang. However, the park is well maintained and expansive, providing a very welcome escape from the concrete jungles of Singapore."
Kent Ridge Park,5,A peaceful small park with stunning view of Singapore's sea port.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"A sigh to the eyes. Great walkways dotted with rest points. There's a fitness centre, a canopy walk with a great view and small lakes."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Nice walk from Hort Park.
Very green"
Kent Ridge Park,5,Love it!
Kent Ridge Park,5,Nice view of the coast
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Kent Ridge Park is THE spot to go to when I want to be one with nature (as natural as it gets here in Singapore). With lush flora and a wide array of natural, acoustic sounds from local residents (“birds and the bees”, dragon flies and squirrels), you will naturally gravitate towards a meditative state. Of course, this spot comes with a bird’s eye view of the southern parts of Singapore. If you get a chance to get up here, it will be worth the effort."
Kent Ridge Park,5,Thank Q very very nice view at the top of the Ridge.
Kent Ridge Park,4,Great for walking among trees and undulating paths.
Kent Ridge Park,5,Nice and quiet park to get away from city life.
Kent Ridge Park,5,One of the quieter parts of Singapore with a great story behind it. Worth a visit if you are around the area 😊
Kent Ridge Park,4,Nice place to stroll and run.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Honestly loved it. It's got a nice metal walkway elevated metres of the ground so you're close to the trees, and on a nice sunny day, you can take many nice photos of the park. Really nice walk for families, couples and friends on a weekend morning."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Very steep climb from the main road to the park entrance if you're going up by bike or walking. The hike alone is a great workout.  Once there, it's a wide green area on top of a hill with a few sections. The park is quite old-worldly, with very tall connifers and cement pagoda-type sitting strutures, mixed with large, mature canopy-style trees. It's beautiful - and even on a humid day there will be quite enough shade.  Branching off within the park are a canopy plank bridge brings you into the Hort Park, and on the other side is some kind of entrance into the forest brush that leads somehow to an old condo on the other side.  I think mostly university staff and students use this park regularly, it is so far off from any othe residential area, and such a hilly climb to get to.  If you can get here (preferrably just come up by car, there is  car park at the entrance), it is worth an afternoon or too."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Quiet walk in nature. Fresh air, sound of the wind blowing through the trees."
Kent Ridge Park,4,Beautiful night view
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Great views, canopy walk, amidst nature"
Kent Ridge Park,5,"If you are interested in History, nature, culture, wildlife, birdwatching, this is a place to add to your list. I like the way the history is presented in a limited area in a creative manner. I wish there is such a place in my country too. I also like the way the staff relate to the visitors. One bit of advice, if you are planing to visit the meusium, make sure you are hydrated because they do not let you take in water bottles. May be for a good reason of avoiding spillage.

The peak is full of flora and fauna. Do not feed the animals, but enjoy them. Better be ready for rain while enjoying. I wish I had more time to spend in the tree top walking. I missed most of it for rain. Don't worry about tickets, all these thing are for free. Take some time out to enjoy while you are in Singapore."
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Nice and clean. Well maintained. Clean washrooms. Scenic but quiet, especially in the afternoon."
Kent Ridge Park,3,Nice place to have a walk.

Kent Ridge Park,5,Nice scenery.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"This relatively small park perched on the side of a hill is not the most popular as it is not very accessible. However, It's lack of accessibility is its advantage. Unlike other parks, its charm is being hidden away from the crowds. Those who make their way there will be rewarded with vantage viewpoints and well shaded pathways."
Kent Ridge Park,5,Great place to take a hike! And it’s still so close to civilisation!
Kent Ridge Park,5,Quiet park to get away from the hectic city life. Good for nice picnic but beware of the wild monkeys. Safety is key

Kent Ridge Park,5,A paradise for joggers and nature lovers.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Kent Ridge Park, it has an ever-changing flora and always interesting to walk three. The entrance is from the South Buona Vista road with amble of parking space. Up at the Park the are various walking tracks with the most attractive being the tree top walk with its fantastic view to Alexandra. The Park however is part of the Southern Ridges and itself connects to Science Park 1, or NUS, to a lovely man made Lake or simply to the Pasir Panjang MRT. A great place to explore again and again!!"

Kent Ridge Park,5,Good. A very nice place.
Kent Ridge Park,5,"Good for half day hiking and it’s linked to Hort Park, another cool place to check out."

St Joseph's Church,5,"Still under restoration.
The interior provided a sense of calm and contentment. I really hope the restored interior will continue to give a sense of belonging."
St Joseph's Church,5,"This church is in the middle of the Bugis-Bras Basah area. Very accessible. You won't miss it.
Confessions from 11:30 am to 1 pm (or so) every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I forgot the other schedules.
They have masses at 1:15 and 6:30 pm on weekdays.
Saturday anticipated mass at 5 pm.
Sunday masses at 8 am, 10 am and 5 pm."
St Joseph's Church,4,It's a beautiful facility and it was a pleasure to look at it.
St Joseph's Church,5,"Matthew 5:9 (BBE)
Happy are the peacemakers: for they will be named sons of God."
St Joseph's Church,5,One of Singapore's historical Catholic churches. It was under renovation few months back and still ongoing I believe. Was fortunate to hear mass here years back. Would love to visit & hear mass here again once this church re-opens following its renovation. A very beautiful church with rich history. Posting some old photos taken in 2017.
St Joseph's Church,5,"One of the most beautiful Catholic Churches in Singapore. There is one more St. Joseph church in bukit timah area.
St. Joseph church on Victoria Street now is on temporary closure from 1Aug 2017 for 1 year or longer."
St Joseph's Church,4,"Opp. National library.
Catholic church.
Easy access by bus / train"
St Joseph's Church,3,"It’s very quiet and wonderful place to calm yourself down here. When I visit here, it’s very hot outside but when the wind blows, I felt cool a bit and comfortable.
It opens for public so when you happen to be here, you can have a look inside:)
*the opening date, you need to search on the internet or contact to check."
St Joseph's Church,5,Smll Catholic Roman Church but lovely
St Joseph's Church,5,The architecture was nice! Went a few times for various occasions! Accessible as well!
St Joseph's Church,5,"Although the person who picked up my call was really rude and contradicted what the Catholic church promoting to be inclusive, the church however is a really nice place to pray and is located in a central area that is accessible. It's just across the national library and there are other church in the vicinity such as Saints Peter and Paul which you can explore too. Really should go."
St Joseph's Church,4,Still under renovation
St Joseph's Church,5,visit on mournty Thursday with my girl. it's been many years I think almost 19 years that I didn't visit this church. Last time visit on Good Friday with my mum in law. This church touches my girl so much that she said wow it's the most beautiful church I ever seen. We are going to attend Easter Mass on Saturday night with whole family. Thank you St Joseph!
St Joseph's Church,2,This church has been closed since July 2017 for repairs. tomorrow I will go back and take a photo of the sign. But no problem just cross the street and the Church of St. Peter and Paul is there. Be safe everyone!
St Joseph's Church,5,"This is one of many catholic church in singapore, it used to have a great i terior. Last time i came it being renovated, don't know till when it takes."
St Joseph's Church,5,"Very beautiful church with reverent liturgies. Home to the Singapore Latin Mass Community, which worships every Sunday at 3 p.m. Magnificent sacred art and architecture, with exquisite stained glass and countless statues, plus little Portuguese scenes relating to Our Lady of Fatima depicted in blue and white tiles on the outer walls. Conveniently located near Bugis Junction. An important part of Singapore's history.

My grandma had her funeral wake here, and it was a good resting place, convenient for mourners to come and pray. Also, being near Sts Peter and Paul, the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and Our Lady of Lourdes, easy for Catholics to make a mini-pilgrimage through all 4 churches."
St Joseph's Church,5,"Saint Joseph's Church is a Roman Catholic church in Singapore. It is located along Victoria Street in the Rochor Planning Area, within the Central Area of Singapore's central business district. The church was constructed from 1906–12 with its foundation stone laid in 1904. The building was built in the Gothic style by the Portuguese Mission. Saint Joseph's Church is noted for its Portuguese-inspired religious traditions, such as the annual Good Friday celebrations"
St Joseph's Church,5,"The Sunday 10am mass Cathedral's choir is amazing, and the quaint retro canteen with home-made food is a wonderful experience. Not to forget the 3pm Extraordinary Form (Latin) Mass to experience first hand how the Catholic Church has authentically worshipped for over 19 centuries."
St Joseph's Church,4,"Very pretty cathedral, the largest church in Singapore. The stained glass and blue walls are quite picturesque and fit perfectly with the warmth and tropical vibe of Singapore. It gets a bit warm in here with only fans, but the stone at least stays cool. Cool site to explore in Singapore."
St Joseph's Church,5,"Nearest station is the Bras Basah station which is about 3 mins walk.

I attended the 10:30 am Sunday mass. You can feel the joy when you go to mass here at St. Joseph. Everyone was participating very well in the mass. The choir is very talented. Priest gave the most inspiring homily. The church staff made sure that everyone gets a sit.

In the second floor, there's a pipe organ. Air conditioning of the whole church is pretty good."
St Joseph's Church,1,"It's a awful parlor, expensive and didn't even have air con parlor charge $530 and yet can't even cater outside buffet. And the drinks charge $300 even it's unused, the staffs are so rude. Will never recommend my customers to this parlor anymore. The most beautiful church will be St Teresa the service it's good."
St Joseph's Church,5,One of beautiful Catholic church in Singapore. You can come pray or visit the church & admire the beauty of it.
St Joseph's Church,4,"Beautiful church with an amazing priest, Father Christoph. Its architecture is unique in its Portuguese style and this reconstructed version has remained largely true to its initial form. The church is fully air-conditioned and the acoustics are still incredible. Have to agree with some of the reviews here though - some staff members are quite rude. But still visit Father Christoph, who really does embody the fundamentals of catholic inclusivity, humility and fellowship.

Two annoying issues which made attending mass quite unpleasant have recently been solved: there was an incredibly rude elderly usher (a Caucasian lady) with a penchant for unnecessarily barking at church attendees who genuinely had no idea where to sit or place their stuff in an often overcrowded space. I guess most didn't tell her off for being discourteous out of respect to the mass, which is nice. But the expression on some of these poor people's faces afterwards was pitiful. The other thing is the cathedral choir, which really is phenomenal, and a must-see. Problem is the conductor seemed to prefer the sound of his own voice to that of the cathedral choir; thus many a moment was spent waiting for the aimless rambling and awkward phrasing to cease, and the hymns to commence. Thankfully, both the rude usher and the conductor have since moved away to the Cathedral which reopened recently, and St. Joseph's has regained its conducive environment."
St Joseph's Church,5,Historical place of worship. Looks better now with new coat of paint.
St Joseph's Church,5,"In this church, my best friend wedding... A monumental spiritual bench..."
St Joseph's Church,1,"I just called to ask for mass timing because they dont have a website, but the one who picked up the call was very rude and ranting about why so many people calling and asking the same question... Probably the reason why not so many catholics go for mass nowadays, very disheartening."
St Joseph's Church,5,First Catholic church in Singapore. The architecture is in form of Latin Cross. This church was declared as a reserved building.
St Joseph's Church,5,Beautiful church that is much improved after aircon was installed. A very authentic experience of old-school catholic mass.
St Joseph's Church,3,"Now the church is under upgrading work/renovation work, it's closed for the time being till further notice."
St Joseph's Church,5,"Very nice Church, have a peek inside looks wonderful and a unique design"
St Joseph's Church,5,Catholic church conveniently located in the city center. Really enjoyed the mass today!
St Joseph's Church,1,Church is closed. No mention of it in their Facebook page or site.
St Joseph's Church,3,Church has been under renovation since aug 2017. Mass will be held at cathedral of the good Shepherd instead.
St Joseph's Church,4,Sorry to say l am still waiting for renovations to be completed it's almost 3years wait
St Joseph's Church,5,Nice church and excellent choir. But the show off soloist conductor uncle is soooo boring.
St Joseph's Church,5,Great historical architecture...  loved it..
St Joseph's Church,5,"Visited the church today, March 17, 2019, the site is still under renovation, have to go to Church of Sts. Peter &  Paul along Queen Road instead."

Sunflower Garden,4,"The garden is nothing overly special, but I love it because it always reminds me I'm in Singapore transiting back to see my relatives in Malaysia.

It is also a nice touch to have a bit of nature in such a mechanical and industrialised environment."
Sunflower Garden,4,"Nice flower garden in Changi Airport. If you are frequent traveler and already visited butterfly garden and no interesting movie in theatre, this should be explored. Good to get fresh air while waiting for the flight. Bit of monotonous as compared to butterfly garden. May be the flowers on display keep on changing with season. Other areas also have very beautiful flower arrangements, especially various varities of orchids."
Sunflower Garden,5,Nice little oasis of sunflower at T2 in Changi airport. Good place to step out for some fresh air after waiting in the airport for a long time. First time seeing sunflower in person so that is a plus. Not a big place so just another one of these small things you can discover in this huge airport.
Sunflower Garden,5,"A beautiful place to spend some time in if you're in transit. There are sunflowers all year around. We were there at sunrise and it what a view it was! The garden is beautiful and fresh breath of air all day but bonus points at sunrise and sunset! You can see the runway and airplanes from above as well!
Great place for taking pictures or just enjoying some fresh air."
Sunflower Garden,4,"This is an outdoor space at T2 right next to the movie theater if you are needing to warm up from the air-conditioned terminal.

The sunflowers are nicely arranged in a well kept garden which also served as a smoking area.

Singapore's heat can be a deterrent if you are hoping to stay outdoor longer. However, the sunflowers and greenery offer a beautiful sight against the setting sun closer to evening time."
Sunflower Garden,5,"It's a nice place to take a break. With yellow colored flowers (Sunflowers) and green bushes and leaves. It's outdoor and a sunny place if you want to get out from the A/C room to get more sunlight and fresh air. Soothing wind and rumbling sound from the airplanes machine. It can be a quite place if you prefer a lone time. You can go to this place after check in and go through the immigration check in Terminal 2 Chang'i Airport. Follow the sign, and it will take you to the upper floor."
Sunflower Garden,5,"Another sweet spot in Changi Airport. Aside from the movie theatre, it’s good to visit the Sunflower garden if you’re planning to kill time. I went there in the evening, however, I suggest going there around 5-6am when there’s already light but no painful sun’s rays yet.

The location is perfect if you enjoy watching planes take off and land. Since it’s in Changi, it’s become famous among travelers in transit there. It’s quite a relaxing escape.

It has a smoking area in case you would like to light a cigarette while there."
Sunflower Garden,5,One of the most relaxing place to be in Changi Airport. You can spend your time here while waiting for your next flight. I was so amazed that they managed to keep this garden clean and beautiful. I would definitely come back here if I had a chance 😍💕
Sunflower Garden,4,"Inside the airport at Changi on a roof top is this cool sunflower garden. They are well kept and absolutely beautiful. A nice relaxing
spot."
Sunflower Garden,5,"The Sunflower Garden is located in Terminal 2, Transit Area of Changi Airport, Singapore. It's tucked in a corner, after the upper entertainment area near the mini theatre. You'll find vibrant sunflowers here all year round. My favourite place to hangout at Changi Airport! Very well maintained, kudos to the gardeners :) Come here for a whiff of fresh air, and to let your eyeballs gaze at these yellow beauties. The garden also offers view of the planes."
Sunflower Garden,5,"If you have time, you may spend 10 mins here. Enjoy being arounded  by sunflower"
Sunflower Garden,4,"Take the elevator towards the entertainment deck, and then just follow the way. It will lead you to this garden. Probably this place is just a smoking area in disguise, but that's still one good idea to bring yet another refreshment to the airport"
Sunflower Garden,4,Very nice garden deck facing the runway. Some interesting facts about the sunflower mentioned on boards to read. A pretty sight inside an airport.
Sunflower Garden,5,"For those who love nature, this garden is a great place to relax and spend time while waiting for your next flight."
Sunflower Garden,5,"One of the entertaining place at Changi airport. A beautiful collection of sunflowers. Great view of Changi airport from sunflower garden. We were here during morning hour, so it was really peaceful and soothing here. Free gaming zone as well as theatre is close to it."
Sunflower Garden,5,"The Sunflower garden is located in Terminal 2, next to the Cinema and the gaming zone. It is a beautiful zone with sunflower plants and a smoking area on the left hand side. I really enjoyed my time here, especially watching the airplanes departing from terminal 2. The sunflower garden is located next to the takeoff track."
Sunflower Garden,4,This is in Jewel Changi Airport Terminal 2. You would have to pass by immigration then take the train to transfer to different terminal
Sunflower Garden,5,Beautiful place to enjoy your visit while waiting for your flight. It may be better to visit at noon 😁
Sunflower Garden,5,Awesom experience. Mind blowing.  Ask to any airport person for the location. It is in 3rd floor.
Sunflower Garden,5,"Beautiful spot in Changi, near with movie theater, I mean entertainment desk"
Sunflower Garden,5,"This place in the airpot having roof-top sunflower garden stands as a view point. The smoking point at the place is quite peaceful compared to that one of inside. Open air smoking point near this place is good. next to this place their is a indoor theater running the show all through the day. Computer desk for wifi and longue to take rest, more conveinent and generous meal for around 5~9 SGD is available around this floor. The entratinment area where you can video play games and all stuff."
Sunflower Garden,5,This place is very lovely. It likes you finding a best gem in the middle of the jungle. It really beautiful park at the airport. The idea of this garden is extremely brilliant.
Sunflower Garden,4,"Nice break from the inside of an airport, they have sun lamps so great at night as well"
Sunflower Garden,4,Lovely garden to kill some time in terminal 2. Smoking area is also here.
Sunflower Garden,5,Beautiful place...you can see sun flowers and planes
Sunflower Garden,5,"What a place, you can see here Plane Landing & Departure, its a open place smoking zone at changi international airport in Singapore."
Sunflower Garden,5,cuteee garden at changi airport! it's quite a walk if you are on the opposite side of this garden but it is definitely worth it. they provided smoking area in this garden so no worries for fellow smokers. great view of the runaway of changi airport as well!
Sunflower Garden,3,"Its on the third floor of the changi airport
Its on an open area.   Those carry their luggage on a trolley , plz pay attention that u might have to leave the trolley at the steps and take ur baggage from their onwards at the entrance. Its open terrace with a view to flights and the ground as such.  If it rains u might get wet as their is no roof. I could find almost 3 varieties of sunflower over here.  The flowers are as usual big. They could have included more kinds and designs as this adds on to the grace of this airport not to say."
Sunflower Garden,4,A nice a beautiful garden filled with sun flowers. It's located in terminal 2 right next to gaming zone. They have opening hours for this so if you fall under that time of transit go have a check at it.
Sunflower Garden,5,Aunflower garden inside the changi airport is lovely place
Sunflower Garden,4,Beautiful place but far from the city
Sunflower Garden,3,"It's a pretty garden in the Changi airport filled with sunflowers. As the weather is always warm in Singapore, it's nice to chill in fresh air. Unfortunately there's also a smoking area there so if there are smokers there then the air won't be fresh at all. The garden itself is quite small and there's nothing more than sunflowers so I would just recommend chilling there when there are no smokers or if you're a smoker then I guess it's a good place to chill and smoke."
Sunflower Garden,4,You can observe planes taxing while sitting within a garden full of sunflowers! There is a smoking zone as well near the garden.
Sunflower Garden,4,"Beautiful outside garden, smaller garden than I thought and quite short sunflowers than expected, but still beautiful."
Sunflower Garden,5,Best sunflower garden in the world that you can find. First in any airport
Sunflower Garden,5,"Hidden gem at Changi Airport, not crowded. Great place to relax yr eyes"
Sunflower Garden,5,"If you drop by at Changi airport Terminal 2, this is a place that you couldn't miss out! Especially sunny day 🌻"
Sunflower Garden,3,Quite a nice place to spend time. Kids could also watch some live planes
Sunflower Garden,4,"Beautiful garden situated on the roof, perfect to kill time during layovers 👌🏽🌻"
Sunflower Garden,3,Natural flora and fauna admist burgeoning crowd!

Sunflower Garden,4,Funny place in an airport worth a visit if you have time for a couple of minutes
Sunflower Garden,5,Little outdoor garden inside the airport in terminal 2. An area of 300 m2 with a separate smoking area
Sunflower Garden,5,nice place for getting sleep or best rest in the middle of transit
Sunflower Garden,5,One of the places to visit in the Changi Airport Terminal 2. ❤
Sunflower Garden,4,"Just some sunflowers at an airport. No revenue being generated, just a little something to make your wait that bit nicer."
Sunflower Garden,4,Singapore airport keeps you occupied if you have long tranist hours
Sunflower Garden,5,Great place to visit when u at T2 transit area
Sunflower Garden,5,"It's refreshing, can see the green things amid fatigue at the airport"
Sunflower Garden,5,Superb! Best to watch during sunrise 💓
Sunflower Garden,5,Beautiful graden in  airport good to roam around.
Sunflower Garden,5,"Sunflower Garden at Changi International Airport in Singapore, very beautiful garden with lots of sunflowers.
According to fossil records, sunflowers first appeared on earth about or 48 million years ago during the Eocene period. With over 70 species sunflowers belong to the largest family of plants called the Compositae. The family name is derived from the root word composite, alluding to the main characteristic of this group of plants that has composite flowers - a single flower made up of hundreds of smaller flowers. If you look closely at the sunflower through a magnifying glass, you will see that it is actually made up of countless tiny flowers! Sunflower plants can be as small as 10cm, or up to 5m in height withs flowers ranging in size from 1cm to almost half a metre in diameter! Sunflowers are cultivated for their ornamental value horticulture and floristry. They are also a major cash crop cultivated as a source of food, fabric and paper and also for producing paint and cosmetics. Changi Airport's Sunflower Garden was created in 2002 and covers an area of 300 square metres. There are about 500 sunflower plants on display in the garden, most of which are grown at our very own plant nursery. A team of horticulturists grow the plants from seeds which take about 90 days to grow to 1m tall budding plants before they are brought to the garden to bloom. We hope that you will find this garden a welcome break in your travels and enjoy the cheeriness of the sunflowers."
Sunflower Garden,5,There are many things to see in life which’s precious 🤩❣️
Sunflower Garden,4,Beautifull garden but why do u put a smoking section next to it ?
Sunflower Garden,4,"It's a small garden, I can't say it's extraordinary but certainly one of its kind on any airports."

Sunflower Garden,5,The Sunflowers are huge ! Healthy and Pest free.  The premises were extremely clean. And there are washrooms nearby should there be a need. Totally convenient.
Sunflower Garden,4,Sunflower garden is very nice. It's an outside park if metal flowers. Inside is a large area and s free movie theater. There are also 2 airport hotel lounge areas next to it but many people seem to rest in the park area which is open 24 hours.
Sunflower Garden,5,"The sunflower garden is  located at T2. You can take the escalator beside the entertainment deck at the ground floor. From the signboard you can easily find the sunflower garden. Extremely well maintained with lot of golden yellow sunflowers & yellow & orange, carrot coloured Marigold flowers. It was late evening during my visit, so the garden was dark. The garden is not very big but with a lot of sunflowers around. From the garden you can view the planes taking off or arriving. A good place to catch some fresh air and relax your eyes.
The end sector is a smoking area adjacent to the transit lounge.  There is information about Sunflower & the entire place is nicely illuminated at night time.  There is a quiet rest area, cafe serving drinks & snacks & Transit hotel at the same level."
Sunflower Garden,4,"Interesting garden outside of the terminal. It is located on the first floor so keep an eye out for the signs. Apart from the sunflowers, it also has some nice views of the planes. It is located close ot eh cinema and entertainment area in Changi Airport."
Sunflower Garden,5,"Another amazing garden in the heart of Singapore airport. This is something everyone who transits through the airport should do. Whether it is a quick stop or a longer walk around - it calms the nerves in and around the busy, hectic airport."
Sunflower Garden,4,"This garden is accessible from terminal 2 departure (next to the entertainment section where you can enjoy free movie screening and PlayStation games).

It's good to visit during the day and night. It takes 10-15 mins to visit the whole garden.

There's also an outdoor smoking area next to it."
Sunflower Garden,5,One of a least known about area in terminal 2 located on level 3 near the theater. The landscape is very beautiful which showcases Singapore as a garden city at its best. Kudos to the gardeners maintaining the landscape. A must go place if u leaving Singapore by terminal 2.
Sunflower Garden,5,A great viewing gallery to see the flowers and the planes. You can see several planes in the air simultaneously at times.
Sunflower Garden,5,The sunflower garden on the roof on terminal two is a great place to get outside when you are in transit at Singapore airport. It is located close to the cinema and entertainment area. There are views across the runaways and it is ideal for a plane spotter fan. The thing that I hated was that it had a large smoking zone and I was hit by a wall of smoke as soon as I walked out into the garden.
Sunflower Garden,4,Sunflower Garden with nice view on the airport.
Sunflower Garden,5,Nice place to spend time ! Beautiful roof top view of sunflower garden .Must visit place if  you have enough transit time at changi airport.
Sunflower Garden,5,"I accidentally stumbled upon this place while waiting for my flight. It is such a gem of a place! It is located near the game room and cinema - which is also provided for free. From this location, you can see the various airplanes that are parked in the area, and the various sunflowers, of course. The sunflower garden itself isn't that big. The area is actually semi-outdoor, so during sunny days, it's also a good place to warm yourself considering how cold Changi Airport can be.

Definitely a place to visit if you need some fresh air during a long transit."

Bus: 2, 12, 33, 61, 63, 80, 143, 197, 961, 970, CT18 and CT28.

The massage shop is also quite skillful, but it seems that the shops are making ends meet, and when you enter one shop, you are taken to another shop for treatment.
Regardless of the quality of the items for sale, it feels cheap, so I always visit.

People's Park Complex,5,"(Translated by Google) Indonesian favorite place when visiting Singapore.
Long before there are applications such as traveloka, agoda, or airbnb, this apartment is one of the places to stay for Indonesian people.

Many apartment owners rent their rooms to tourists.

What makes me happy with this apartment is its strategic location.
Exit the MRT station, arrive immediately.

The food court is also a large choice of various kinds of food.

It's just that, this apartment is decades old, the outside interior does look less attractive. Then the elevator only serves floors 5,10,15,20,25 and 30.

If our apartment unit is not on that floor, then we still need to walk.

(Original)
Tempat favorit orang Indonesia ketika berkunjung ke Singapore.
Jauh sebelum ada aplikasi seperti traveloka, agoda, ataupun airbnb, apartemen ini merupakan salah satu tempat menginap pilihan orang Indonesia.

Banyak pemilik apartmen yang menyewakan kamarnya kepada para wisatawan.

Hal yang membuat saya senang dengan apartmen ini adalah lokasinya yang strategis.
Keluar dari stasiun MRT, langsung tiba.

Food court juga banyak pilihan aneka macam makanan.

Hanya saja, apartmen ini sudah berumur puluhan tahun, interior luar memang kelihatan kurang menarik. Lalu lift hanya melayani lantai 5,10,15,20,25,dan 30.

Jika unit apartmen kita berada bukan di lantai tersebut, maka kita masih perlu berjalan kaki."

Sisters Islands,4,NPB's organized Sisters' Islands Marine Park Intertidal Guided Walk provides good insight to the marine habitats.
Sisters Islands,4,A small serene island...just to relax
Sisters Islands,5,Very nice place to visit for one day tour
Sisters Islands,5,The untouched beaches offer much to see at low tide.   It's a pity there are no scheduled ferry services to this island yet.  The cost to charter a boat might be prohibitive for some.

Sisters Islands,4,"Quite nice,, but the monkeys there,, so bothering 😂😂 we cannot eat slowly 😅😅😅 they welcome you at the entrance..."
Sisters Islands,3,Alway passed by

Sisters Islands,5,Sisters island does not have any public ferry service connecting to it from the mainland of singapore but luckily I was able to register for one of the guided tours by NEA and it was an amazing tour. We were able to catch a lot of the marine life on the island and overall was a great experience.
Sisters Islands,5,"Great day trip, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is just visiting Singapore for a short time, but would recommend for someone who lives in Singapore and is looking for something to do on a free day."
Sisters Islands,5,"Beautiful Island and nature, oxygen for the spirit"
Sisters Islands,5,Very rich marine life around
Sisters Islands,5,Nice
Sisters Islands,1,"(Translated by Google) Check point of immigration service of Singapore state. A boat of immigration service is on duty around the clock. All small vessels at the entrance and exit to Singapore call them on channel 72 and draw up a crew on the water, not approaching the shore. The procedure takes several minutes.
This is important to know.

bridge spans over 250 metres across the Singapore River and is one of many bridges around this area and the nearby Boat Quay. The great thing about this bridge is that it provides great views of the waterfront, Merlion Park and the Marina Bay."

Just walking distance to Merlion and Esplanade using this bridge."

Esplanade Bridge,5,a perfect place to capture the Singapore skyline.

Esplanade Bridge,5,nice place to walk
Esplanade Bridge,5,"Esplanade Bridge is a pedestrian and car bridge that extends over Singapore River. The construction of the bridge was completed in 1997. It is 261 meters long and 70 meters wide. The bridge was built to relieve car traffic from nearby Anderson Bridge. The bridge offers panoramic views of Marina Bay and it is part of the Singapore Grand Prix. The construction of the Esplanade Bridge east of the mouth of the Singapore River forced the Merlion statue to be moved from its original location at the river mouth to its present location north of One Fullerton. When I was visiting, Esplanade Bridge is part of the Bridges Of Time light art installation. There was an installation of hundreds of vertical flags which are illuminated by kaleidoscopic lighting. It is an amazing photo spot."

Esplanade Bridge,5,A beautiful view.
Esplanade Bridge,5,"Walking Bridge near Merlion Park. It has a terrific view of the Spectra light show (from 20:00 and 21:00), as well as the Marina Bay Sands.
From here you can see the entire Marina Bay, the skyscrapers of the business district, and Theaters on the bay."
Esplanade Bridge,5,"A 261-meter-long bridge was built for faster access from the Marina Center to Shenton Way Financial Square. Since 2008, the bridge has also been a part of the F1 Singapore Grand Prix circuit and must be closed for the whole weekend. There is a great view to Merlion statue."
Esplanade Bridge,4,"It is a very long and crowded bridge that is full of tourists loitering around. It is not an easy bridge for cyclist to pass through the bridge. This bridge connects tourists from the Esplanade to the Merlion Park, making a good platform for them to take pictures of the land marks of downtown Singapore. This bridge does not have a shelter like the neighboring, which is Helix Bridge. During working hours, the bridge is deserted."
Esplanade Bridge,5,Touriest Attraction...one should visit if in singapore for few days
Esplanade Bridge,4,Good place to be to enjoy the Singapore River view

Esplanade Bridge,3,"(Translated by Google) In 2015, east of the Esplanade Bridge, the Jubilee Bridge was built on the 50th anniversary of the state's independence, a pedestrian bridge that was designed to make it easier for tourists to cross the Singapore River between Marina Bay and the Finance District.
You shouldn't visit both bridges as a tourist, but you can see them very well from the Merlion, and maybe you use them to cross the river mouth.

Direkt östlich neben die Esplanade Bridge wurde 2015 zum 50.

Eigens besuchen sollte man als Tourist beide Brücken nicht, aber man sieht sie sehr gut vom Merlion aus, und eventuell nutzt man sie ja auch zum Überqueren der Flussmündung."

Liang Court,4,"It is a great place to get all the Japanese stuffs and foods. Unfortunately, this building is going re-development."
Liang Court,5,"There is a big Uniqlo store here, and a lot of Japanese restaurants. The best thing about this mall is the Medi-ya Japanese grocery at the basement. They sell their fresh food and sushi at a discount before closing."
Liang Court,4,Mostly here for 2 reasons: 1. Nirai Kanai and 2. Meidi-ya
Liang Court,5,There is a big Japanese supermarket in basement. Kinokumi Ya is located in level three and second largest store in Singapore. Mostly quiet and clean. New downtown line MRT station is next to the building.
Liang Court,3,There isn't any variety of shops there in this small mall. The most interesting shops in Liang Court will be the Japanese supermarket at basement. You can find almost Japanese stuffs there from clothes to foods!
Liang Court,4,Seems to have a special focus for everything Japanese... From Japanese supermarket to Japanese restaurants; from Japanese bookstore to Japanese-speaking information counter staff.. <<TaN>>
Liang Court,4,Specialized in Japanese shops & restaurants. There's Meidi-ya Japanese restaurant in B1 selling high quality sushi with affordable price.👍
Liang Court,3,"I'm not really a fan of this shopping centre at all. It's decent, has a variety of stores, and is in a good location. Near Clarke quay MRT, it is a convenient location and is easy to get around from. It's popular with the clubbing crowd although they closed down the 24 hour McDonalds. Other than that it has an extremely complicated layout and is very easy to get lost in."
Liang Court,5,"Very nice 👍 shopping 🛒 mall with great 👍 Japanese supermarket and Taiwan 🇹🇼 Restaurant and great great 👍 🇯🇵 Japanese sushi 🍣 sashimi Restaurant at basement. The staffs told me whole building will be renovating I think 🤔 next year March 2020.  So ,  please take some time to visit before all gone."
Liang Court,5,Visit the basement eateries besides the supermarket to have a good gauge of what true Japanese cuisine is like in Japan. I'm sure people who have been to Japan will agree with me.
Liang Court,2,This place had been around for more than 30 years since I first known! So many changes over the last few decades... surprisingly this place can still survived after so many years! Nothing much here except nice quality Japanese food at the supermarket!
Liang Court,4,Very convenient to visit since the dtl is opening on 21 Oct.
Liang Court,3,"Not really situated in a very accessible location, this place is mostly quiet during off-peak office hours which is alluring to those who prefers a quiet and crowd-free shopping. Plus they have a pretty good japanese outlet which serves mouth-water dishes."
Liang Court,5,Heaven for japanese foods and groceries
Liang Court,5,Nice cleaning shopping mall....
Liang Court,4,Yummy collagen hot pot. The fried chicken with egg mayo is good too!
Liang Court,5,"Really a nice mall. Hundreds of shops and you wouldn’t miss anything. They are all here from MK, Ferrari, Gucci. Keep an eye on your girls not to loose them."
Liang Court,5,"Organized and clean. Well maintained.
I have been to this place a many times. The staff at bars appears friendly and helpful enough. Great location and good service. We had a good time. Parking was not that bad. Order was served as per our expectation. It was not very crowded. We got a place to sit and relax. We would recommend this place."
Liang Court,4,Lots of Japanese restaurants and stuff . Good for a sashimi fix
Liang Court,4,"I love the pork Japanese rice on the second level. The pork is from Japan, tastes tender. Besides the premium dish uses pork from Japan, the other dishes use pork from USA."
Liang Court,4,"Lots of cafes, river boat stop and as usual shopping options."
Liang Court,5,Grew up coming here. Sad that it will be gone soon.
Liang Court,4,Great place for family and gathering. Do not drive unless necessary as parking is not nice (drive a small car and this is a 5 star rating)! Haha😋
Liang Court,4,Good food and you can find a Japanese's supermarket here Mediya 😊
Liang Court,4,"By all accounts it used to be the place to be back in the 80s, catering to the Japanese expatriate community. It has a high concentration of authentic Japanese owned stores and franchises, however that's less unique nowadays so the center has become a relatively ageing shopping mall. The centre has reportedly already been sold and will soon be redeveloped."
Liang Court,2,Other than the Medi-ya that i love. The rest of the places is like a dead town. So wasted. Only level 1 and basement has shops.
Liang Court,3,"Not many exciting tenants. Some nice Japanese restaurant around. I will come back for Marutama, Dulcet & Studio, Butahage and Tampopo."
Liang Court,3,"Many shops are closed, as apparently the building shall be demolished soon. Shops at basement are still functional and market is well supplied of stuff to satisfy for our needs."
Liang Court,5,spoil with many Japanese food of choices
Liang Court,5,"Simply love this place. When it comes to craving for Japanese good, heres a 1 stop & best at affordable price location. Supermarket is great too. Well maintained standards of fresh products"
Liang Court,3,Meidi Ya there is a great supermarket with quality stuffs!!
Liang Court,5,Nice place to eat if your in tight budget. Near the MRT station
Liang Court,3,"Few restaurants and shops. But not really the place to go for shopping like a real shopping mall. However, very convenient"
Liang Court,3,"Great place for unique items. High amounts of Japanese products.
Plenty of shops closing down. Looks like it is undergoing some changes."
Liang Court,2,"Currently undergoing revamp by new owners, many shops not operating, maybe worth visiting after the revamp."
Liang Court,3,"The food grocery stores here are pretty good, but it use to be much better a few years ago."
Liang Court,4,Love dome restaurants here. Away from the hype. Has nice view of the river.
Liang Court,2,"The mall is quite empty, apart from a Uniqlo & a Japanese Grocery, it’s pretty much nothing."
Liang Court,5,"It had gained the reputation of being the little Japan, with a sizable number of Japanese residing in the area. The best place to be if one wants to get any Japanese product or food."
Liang Court,3,Not much of shops. No life around it. But do have a few nice restaurants to eat. The supermarket have a good choice but quite pricey as they stock lot of Japanese food.
Liang Court,4,Place is still good as usual and conveniently located near to fort canning station and a further walking distance to Clarke Quay which is the main highlights of the area
Liang Court,5,Love the Japanese Supermarket. Always crowded. Love their Japanese products
Liang Court,4,Nice mall with many Japanese related businesses and restaurants. Has a meidiya supermarket to get important Japanese groceries. Restaurant choices are aplenty with different price ranges from $10 onwards. Place isn’t too crowded so good to shop.
Liang Court,5,"Small shopping center, quite Japanese oriented. Very nice food supermarket in the basement, with all you can think of, especially fresh meat, fish, sushi etc.. Great choice of fruit, veggies, any milk products. But the best in this shopping center is the Minami hairdresser! You walk in as an ugly old man, and when you go out – after a fantastic treat by Ivy, including head, neck and shoulder massage – dozens of good looking women will walk up to you making marriage proposals or at least urging you to spend a 2-week holiday with them in Hawaii...."
Liang Court,4,The place has lots of good shops for you to go to!
Liang Court,4,Reasonable price n nice environment
Liang Court,4,"It's a higher end Don Donki. I usually go there for the sauces and fresh fruits. The fruits are relatively expensive but they do taste much better than all other places (Little Farm, Marketplace, Cold Storage). The white peach is a must get!"
Liang Court,4,So far so good...  Use to shopping there. Meidi-ya supermarket can see many Japanese items.
Liang Court,3,Sad to note they will close the building by end march ending a rich history of the shopping mall which thru the years striggled to draw in the crowds. The supermarket was the magnet for shoppers
Liang Court,5,"I really like this place- it is a place that I feel very comfortable in....like the flow and choices of places to patronize....

Could be managed a bit better- specifically getting the vendors to fit and work together- seems some are a bit more devoted to the mall....others...to themselves- a sense of community and working together....might really POP this up....WOW it up..."
Liang Court,5,"This place brings back fond memories of Daimaru.  However, with Meidiya taking over
As the main tenant. It spiced up the whole mall with exquisite and exciting food products
Not only from Japan but from different parts of the world. We enjoy the many Different
Japanese eateries and localized Makan.
Not a huge mall but with simple big exciting
Surprised promotions regularly."
Liang Court,5,"Nice big shopping mall that's a very short walk away from the MRT station, Liang Court is a mall that I catch myself visiting very often. It has a good variety of shops to visit, as well as a bunch of Japanese restaurants which I rate highly. There is also a Japanese supermarket at the basement which you shouldn't miss when you visit. Overall, it's a nice place to go for a quick weekend shopping trip and definitely one of my favorite shopping malls to go to."
Liang Court,4,Come here to dine! Indulge with Japanese restaurants Authentic foods. Then go out there and shop for variety of choices from chothing to accessories
Liang Court,5,"Strategic place to go everywhere, easy to reach MRT stations and bus stop"
Liang Court,5,"Went to shops which sell Japanese and Korean products to look for shrimp rice crackers but not available. Finally managed to buy it from Medi-ya supermarket and only 6 packs is left on the shelf so I buy all 6 packs, super yummy but a little bit salty."
Liang Court,5,"A bit dated, some shops have closed or moved out. The Japanese supermarket is still going strong and is the main draw because of the unique Japanese and Korean products. The renovation, because of the new owners, probably couldnt come at a better time."
Liang Court,2,"Pretty much a dead mall with only a few odd shops, Uniqlo, the basement Japanese supermarket and F&B stalls. Gone are the good old days with anchor tenants like Daimaru, Kinokuniya or even Audio House. The famed musical fountain no longer exists. Shopping options pale in comparison even to Heartland malls."
Liang Court,5,An always clean and neat mall.
Liang Court,5,"Used to have the Omu Rice which is really delicious!
Mediya is also a good place to go grocery shopping"
Liang Court,5,Just heard Liang Court is closing end of March. Am heartbroken - loved this place since young!  TQ for all the memories
Liang Court,3,Not a very crowded mall ( atleast during weekdays). It is centred around Japanese retail outlets and restaurants. The Fashion Pulpit which is a first of its kind clothes swapping store in Asia is also here on level 2.
Liang Court,4,"Really quiet and empty place. But they have lots of decent Japanese food at reasonable prices and Mediya at the basement which is awesome.

Since it's right next to Fort Canning, you can totally eat your fill then go for a walk of vice versa."
Liang Court,4,All-in-one japanese shopping mall. Too bad they will be redeveloping soon. Will miss all the Japanese food at the B1.
Liang Court,5,This Japanese Supermarket has the best cakes and fresh rolls this side of Paris with unbelievably efficient staff who have the store looking tip top morning noon and night a great place to shop for lunch and dinner whilst on the go.
Liang Court,5,"Very good market, height quality, you can find all products, even a lot of italian food. Japanese sushi and sashimi is very fresh and so good!"
Liang Court,4,"Liang Court has little to offer these days apart from the Japanese mart Medi-ya and the large Uniqlo.

The food court located on the first level is convenient for a quick bite, however prices are steep as expected. Expect to pay about $5 for a bowl of noodles or a plate of chicken rice.

I would not make a trip just to visit Liang Court, but it would suffice as a rest point for food and air conditioning if I’m in the vicinity."
Liang Court,4,"great bags discounts, specially the backpacks."
Liang Court,5,A lot of good japanese options for food.
Liang Court,4,"Small but special. Old but interesting. Full of Japanese styled goods, a very nice book store, Super market and mix of small shops worth to spend half a day to shop around."
Liang Court,3,Basic very good shopping mall near by Singapore entertainment centrum ❣️in this area you find everything what you need! Recommend by the fufu❣️because of whole area I give ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️of 7❤️
Liang Court,5,Best Japanese supermarket we've found with wide selection of products
Liang Court,4,"Great food court with local dishes. In the basement, there is a large japanese supermarket with a large variety of products. Spacious rooms."
Liang Court,5,we like to call it the Japanese mall as they got Japanese supermarket and shops and restaurants geared towards Japanese. Not crowded which I like to go there to relax.. have a meal and shop supermarket.
Liang Court,4,"Staff very friendly and helpful, responding straight away to any requests re the room. Couldn't  fault any aspect  of the hotel. A little dated on the outside but our room was modern and very comfortable. Great location with access to both Clarke and Robertson Quays. Would certainly stay at this hotel again."
Liang Court,4,"Very Japanese some interesting restaurants. The best is the Japanese supermarket, you will find many authentic Japanese products. Also the normal products that you can find in other supermarket but bug Japanese selection"
Liang Court,5,Sad that they are closing soon. One of the best pkaces to visit for Japanese goods.
Liang Court,5,"The Japanese food hall in the basement. Way before don don donki, there was meidi ya with its sashimi and sushi and cooked food and bakery corners, Japanese imports of fresh produce and products, and bonus! no incessant jingle drilling a hole into your brain."
Liang Court,3,Needs to revamp with interesting tenants. Meidi-ya and Meidi-ya food court are the only two reasons why I'm still visiting Liang court. I hope they will still be around after new mall management takes over.
Liang Court,3,"The best thing about this mall is its comprehensive Japanese supermarket in the basement, and several good Japanese eateries below. The new food court on the ground floor is good too. Apart from the food, the rest of the mall hardly registers"
Liang Court,5,closing down soon...good food at b1
Liang Court,3,"neutral review: been here quite a few times. this place serves plenty of Japanese expatriates or Japanese PRs i believe. there's a japanese supermarket and plenty of Japanese restaurants. good if you want to eat sushi or buy sushi ingredients. otherwise, just like any other mall in SG"
Liang Court,4,"Normal shopping mall with lot of shop, food restaurant and other. Feel like Japan style shopping mall :)

Tokyo drift parking space. Good for drifter very bad for new driver. Careful!!!
For sure a non driver parking designer."
Liang Court,3,"There are better shopping malls than this one. That said, if you wanted to grab a quick meal, there’s not a better place. It’s not awfully crowded like the other malls."
Liang Court,2,Most of stores closed.but one good big  Supermarket in the basement
Liang Court,3,The mall has nothing much to shop as most tenants had move out. But as usual it still has the supermarket that sell good Jap style.
Liang Court,3,"Convenient location as it is just right opposite of Fort Canning MRT station, lots of Japanese restaurants"
Liang Court,4,The Japanese Curry place is quite good
Liang Court,5,Meidi Ya supermarket offers great variety of Japanese and western groceries. Also a good choice for fresh produce.
Liang Court,3,"It's going to close down soon due to age, and has a boring feel to it. Hope the new mall is way better and has more fun stores/activities"
Liang Court,5,Due for renovation but the supermarket is fantastic especially for Japanese food but also British and Australian products. The sushi counters are the best supermarket sushi in town and beat many restaurants in town.
Liang Court,4,Decent place to get some local food.
Liang Court,3,Getting up to the carpark is interesting. Mall is pretty lifeless during weekday lunch hour.
Liang Court,5,Nice environment and restaurants. Recommend to take public transport as car park is not car friendly. Make rest room cleaner for all to enjoy👍
Liang Court,5,"Located at boat quey where all the night life are in Singapore, this is a mall is dedicated to everything Japanese. This is dubbed as the Japanese mall in Singapore where you can find Japanese bookstores, Japanese food shops and Japanese supermarket. The quality of the product here are very high so the price is pretty high as well. Would recommend for avid Japanese fans or people who want to buy authentic Japanese products."
Liang Court,5,Big shopping centre that has a large variety of Japanese goods and some interesting restaurants. There is also a Japanese supermarket with authentic Japanese products. Good for Japanese goods lovers.
Liang Court,5,Japan town of Singapore. So it is common to see many Japanese walking around the shopping Malls as most of them would frequent the Mediya supermarket for their Japanese produce. It is also an eye opening experience to look at the range of Japanese beef that is available there.
Liang Court,4,"More food options after renovation. Supermarket is amazing, is more convenient after the operation of the new downtown line. Affordable eating places available as well. Does lack on shopping though."
Liang Court,5,"It's a niche mall which allows Singaporeans to experience buying Japanese food and goods, while being located at the heart of Singapore. It's a shame to see many shops close down due to lack of interest."
Liang Court,5,It wss quite good having uniqlo subway kopitiam
Liang Court,5,Too bad it's gone now. Love their Party World KTV and Meidiya.
Liang Court,5,"One of my favourite malls. It doesn't have many shops but if you love all things Japanese, this is the place."
Liang Court,5,Frequent hangout for the Japanese. Many Japanese restaurants as well as a huge Japanese supermarket that sells fresh poultry and seafood. Great place if you need to get Japanese condiments and fresh sashimi.
Liang Court,4,Nice shopping mall... Good selection. Convenient...
Liang Court,5,Great shopping mall if you want to find authentic Japanese products.
Liang Court,5,Small but v nice shopping centre with her best and biggest Japanese supermarket in Singapore and many decent casual dining Japanese options. One of my comfort places to visit and browse when I don’t have much else to do
Liang Court,3,This place has been around for at least 35 years if not longer. It gone through the ups and downs of mall but the recent asset enhancements seem to bring back the rich Japanese expats. Which is good as the food options will also get better.
Liang Court,4,Great place for japanese food and items liang court will be doing major renovation from 2nd half year 2020
Liang Court,3,Very quiet shopping mall with alot of Japanese restaurants at its basement
Liang Court,4,"Always loved coming here cause of the variety in Japanese food and outlet. The mall caters to a wide range of customers but more geared to the Japanese market.

Head down to the supermarket Mideya to get a range of Japanese ingredients that you might not find in others"
Liang Court,4,The supermarket was cheap. Just don't buy the $46 per kilo meat. Bakery was cheap. Fruit and veg wasn't a bad price.
Liang Court,4,"Eat is open 24 hours though Liang Court is closed. Variety of kids learning centres and Cristofie.

Japanese restaurants, Cafes, Japanese supermarkets and retail shops too."
Liang Court,4,Not much happening place not much shops available. Only Dhaiso a Japanese store was interesting.
Liang Court,4,Nice small shopping mall near Clark Quay covered restaurant / bar area. Small 24hr/day food court with handful of hawker stands.
Liang Court,5,Great place for Japanese food! Numerous Japanese food eateries located in single location. The curry rice at basement is highly recommended.
Liang Court,5,Great selection of stores directly under Novatel including supermarket in basement and variety stores including health beauty. Pharmacy also as well as excellent food court. Top level kindergarten preschool facility
Liang Court,5,Nice Japanese supermarket with a wide range of products.
Liang Court,5,We like the coffee pudding and the milk tea pudding made by Dulcet & Studio at L1. Hope they will not change the recipe. One can see they are using the authentic flavours and not the essence. The matcha pudding is made with real green tea as well.
Liang Court,5,"A place I grew up with. some many changes. sad that it will disappear soon. I remembered Daimaru used to be there and I enjoyed the experience there.

1. Mediya - get my Japanese products from there. I enjoy the marketing there.

2. Curry Rice Stall - my favourite Japanese curry. I'd say the best Japanese curry. I always get 2nd serving of curry!

3. Yayoi - reasonable price for the place they are located in. Food is delicious too!

4. Other stalls include Uniqlo and this Japanese cake shop/cafe on first floor which is amazing.

5. Okinawa restaurant in B1 is also quite good as well.

Go before Liang Court goes!"
Liang Court,5,"Anything about Japanese foods, you can find them all here. With many great choice of selections for food to supermarket too. The price is also reasonable for the quality that you are getting."
Liang Court,5,"Special mall because it has a lot of Japanese shops and a Japanese supermarket, great place to eat and buy groceries if you're a Japanese food lover"
Liang Court,5,"Not crowded even on weekends, lot of Japanese cuisine"
Liang Court,3,"A nostalgia place that requires some revamp to keep it alive. Foot traffic dropped tremendously after Daimaru left eons ago and recently books kinokuniya vacated, so the only reason to go there would be meidi-ya supermarket. Used to be a place where you will think of it when you think of Japanese, but now not so. Now with the new downtown line just beside it, the location is much better than before."
Liang Court,4,"Many Japanese themed stores and restaurants. Pretty casual place. Not a thriving mall, but somewhere to discover specific Japanese stores or food, or perhaps some rare standalone stores (such as a liquor store with difficult to find selections on level 1)"
Liang Court,5,Great Japan themed shopping center. Sad that it will be gone in March 2020
Liang Court,5,"Absolutely love this place for the Japanese supermarket at the basement which is most well stocked Japanese supermarket in Singapore. They have an eclectic choice of fresh produce too that's always so fresh.

But you do have to pay premium price for all the above."
Liang Court,5,I haven't been yet but it's gonna be great
Liang Court,3,"If you want to experience a little bit of Japan's cuisine and shopping, Liang Court is your place. It doesn't replace Japan, but at lease lets you look for some of the things you might have been missing in Japan... if you were from there. The supermarket in the basement is worth a walk around just to look at all the things that they have on offer. They even have the really expensive Wagyu Beef here too, amazing the price of the stuff."
Liang Court,5,"Very good , you get what you are looking for"
Liang Court,4,"From barbershop to liquor shop, soba to sushi, this is definitely your go to mall for everything Japanese. Nothing fancy, just really good, honest (open to interpretation) stuff.

If they don't have it in this mail, you might have go to Japan to get it.

Oh, I'm not bothered with any shops level 3 and above. Except the bookshop."
Liang Court,4,"It is called little Japan in Singapore. There are many Japanese restaurants in this small shopping mall. You really can feel somewhat Japanese taste there. I think a good combination is to have dinner at Liang Court, then go to Clark Quay to have a night life."
Liang Court,5,Love the place but it's closing soon
Liang Court,4,"It's a great shopping centre. There is  also a great variety of restaurants, for all budgets.
My favourite was one called Saizeriya.  as an example at lunch time you can order a plate of pasta, a plate of salad, and soft drink for $7.90  great value"
Liang Court,3,The tenants of the mall have been ordered to leave by March 2020. Do visit this unique bastion of Japanese culture before it closes for redevelopment.
Liang Court,4,Same old grand dame shopping centre in the 70's. Going strong but less crowded. Just passing thru for old times sake 👍🤓
Liang Court,5,Good clothes shoppes and much japanese food
Liang Court,3,Very small shopping centre. Good to go (esp. Sushi in the food store) if you live near but not worth to visit if not
Liang Court,4,"Nice mall with lots of food and shopping available, more of a low key mall for locals and not really meant for foreigners other than Japanese residing in Singapore as the mall features Japanese shops and supermarket chain Meidiya"
Liang Court,5,A wonderful shopping centre where you can find almost anything and everything! Has the only Japanese supermarket in Sg.
Liang Court,5,"Quiet, most of the retailers have moved out."
Liang Court,3,"Now, Why I Am Giving This A Three Is Because On The Top Levels, They Are Mostly Empty. There USED To Be A Kinokunia (Might be spelt wrong) And A Saizeriya. Unfortunately, Both Just Closed Down One Day. I Do Not Know The Problem Of Why It Closed. There Is A Hotel, Taxi Stand, And Restaurants. Restaurants Are Selling Almost Nothing Else But Ramen. It Is Quite Spacious, But The Top Must Be Upgraded. When *Kinokunia* Closed Down, The Capsule Machines Were Not Removed But They Placed A Sign That Said 'Not Available'. Honestly, The Food Court Food Is Way Below Avarage. I Was Going To Give It A Higher Rating, But Due To The Lack Of Stores, I Have To Put The Rating Down."
Liang Court,4,Love Japanese food.. Over there are loads
Liang Court,4,We visited Liang Court for Japanese food. There are a few outlets however we went for the more affordable ones. I had Japanese Beef curry. Japanese curry is more of a stew and not spicey. We also visited the Japanese supermarket. Lots of offerings eg sushi and sashimi takeaways. The wagyu beef is especially good but not cheap. Now and then on rare occasions we splurge.
Liang Court,5,"If you like authentic Japanese food and you have not been to Japan, you can come over to Liang Court. They have Japanese Supermarket ""Meidi-ya""which i always buy their sashimi there, full of Japanese small eateries, which you can try out. Japanese barber shop, $2 shop, bakery, cafe... really very different from other shopping malls in Singapore"
Liang Court,3,"There’s a meidiya (Japanese supermarket) and some other interesting shops inside this shopping mall!
During lunch time, it’s a bit crowded but good to have a look some shops and enrichment class for kids;)"
Liang Court,5,There is a good supermarket selling a good variety of Japanese products. If you are look for Japanese food or any other goods try this supermarket. But be prepared for surprises as far as prices are concerned
Liang Court,5,"A building that full of restaurants, coffee shop beside Novotel Hotel. Quite good for simple breakfast in the morning, and lunch or heavy dinner, range of restaurant grade is from the simple fast food ones to international grade ones. You could find out a lot of things to eat from local to international foods in a simple and quite old building."
Liang Court,4,A small mall filled with Japanese-related stuffs.... I like the Japanese supermarket at the basement and I also enjoy having a cream puff at dulcet & studio @ level 1.
Liang Court,4,"Good place for Japanese food & items.
Also a good place to train driving skills with the narrow path to the underground or above carpark. 😬"
Liang Court,5,"One of the most successful Japan mall in Singapore. An anchor Japanese​ grocery tenant called Meidiya, along with a good selection of Japanese food. I have patronized this mall over two decades."
Liang Court,3,"Turning into and out of carpark very narrow for big car , easily get scratch if not careful"
Liang Court,4,Can be considered one of the oldest mall in the area. Very far to reach from nearest public transport because have to walk very far. The nearest entrance to mall is also a car park entrance / exit so be careful when crossing.
Liang Court,4,Very Japanese centric place. My girlfriend spent extraordinary amount of time at Kinokuniya. A good place for food too.
Liang Court,3,Mostly visit it for the basement which is full got Japanese goodies. The rest of the mall is quite empty or uninteresting. The upper levels are mainly education classes or health and wellness. Good to visit their kinokuniya bookstore. One of the biggest Japanese language bookstores in Singapore.
Liang Court,4,A nice place to shop for japanese goods
Liang Court,2,"The shopping mall has many good restaurants.  There is a Japanese supermarket in the basement. However, toilets/restrooms of the mall should be improved."
Liang Court,4,"A location where many Japanese restaurants around. And they are authentic and pretty good ones. Most of my visits there, ended myself in one of them."
Liang Court,4,"MEIDI-YA, my favourite Japanese supermarket with top quality wagyu beef."
Liang Court,4,Shopping mall with awkward layout. Good for Japanese food. LC kinokuniya has closed. Adjacent to restaurant Clarke Quay area.
Liang Court,5,This is a really good shopping centre. This make of centre is so good in the fact that here in Singapore there are so many that you could spend days in them.
Liang Court,3,Mainly great for the Japanese grocery. Major renovations underway now so will need to revisit this review once they're done.
Liang Court,5,"Nearly every amenity you will beef is available here... Hotel, shop centres, convenience stores, food court, attractions, MRT, bus. Excellent location!"
Liang Court,3,The go to mall for all things japanese. Love the range of food and groceries available at the hyper market.
Liang Court,5,One of my favourite malls around with its large numbers of Japanese eateries with Clark Quay nearby. A great Japanese supermarket at basement.
Liang Court,5,"After the opening of Downtown Line this mall is at the doorstep of Fort Canning station. There are many Japanese shops and restaurants, and my favourite is the Meidi-ya supermarket in the basement, where I can get high quality and affordable sushi and ready-to-eat meals."
Liang Court,3,"Mall closing soon hence many small shop being empty. UNIQLO, supermarket and food stores are opened."
Liang Court,4,Best place for japanese food!
Liang Court,3,"Has just about everything you need: grocery store (but overpriced Japanese version), an eatery, Subway, Starbucks, many restaurants, a Japanese book store, Guardian, jewelry store, bakeries, etc., and there is usually a sale promotion setup in the main lobby.

The eatery area had a strong food odor, however, so I always avoid walking near there.

On the upper floors, lots of shops, salons, etc."
Liang Court,5,"For those who seek shelter from Clarke Quay's busy nightlife and admire the quaint riverside life of Singapore River, Liang Court is the place to be. Not only it is secluded as much, but, those who seek for an adventure on Singapore's famous colourful bumboats, can purchase tickets for these amazing Singapore River rides that is filled with majestic views of Marina Bay and Boat Quay."
Liang Court,4,Will pop in here 1-2 times a month cos the Kinokuniya book store is not as crowded as the Orchard branch. Love the authentic Japanese food at basement and also the unique selection of groceries and stuff found at Meiji supermarket!
Liang Court,4,The grocery mall selling a lot of Japanese products. Good place to shop
Liang Court,3,"Not very big, the toilets were not in good condition. But it still has a good super market and restaurants to be checked out"
Liang Court,5,Loved the experience of the mall. Good choice of stores. Loved the beer shop on the first floor.
Liang Court,4,I would say it's a Super Cosy place for Relaxing.
Liang Court,4,"Ever since Daimaru introduced Singaporeans to the anpan, this place is a compact little Japan"
Liang Court,5,Quiet enough mall but with good food options. Selection of Japanese fare and grocery store makes this a great place.
Liang Court,5,My favourite haunt to get Japanese foodstuff and peripherals. Love the Mediya supermarket the most
Liang Court,4,I bought a guitar here.  Crowded Asian shopping mall full of lots of interesting small stalls.
Liang Court,5,"My favourite Japanese supermarket is there, along some other great outlets (food, clothing and Chinese tea/teaware). Super convenient, 50m from Fort Canning MRT."
Liang Court,4,Kinda sad that Kinokuniya is no longer there. Better to go to the Uniqlo there as it is less crowded and carries the full range.
Liang Court,5,Perfect. Close to the main things we wanted to do. Awesome breakfasts and excellent front staff.
Liang Court,5,"Famous for Japanese product
Great place for shopping and supermarket
Also great restaurants outlets"
Liang Court,5,Good place to stay. Cleaner is really good she washes even the dishes
Liang Court,4,"Not a busy mall. Way up to the parking is unbelivable, tiny way n low car park height. Here is the place fo find some japanese stuff n sake."
Liang Court,4,"Good supermarket with quality vegetables and meats, some air-flown fresh products also available.  The mall is a bit old and similar to other mall's, except more shops selling Japanese products."
Liang Court,3,Tad bit old but you can find odd stuff here
Liang Court,4,"Dinner at Yayoi.
Nice food."
Liang Court,4,"Lots of shops, restaurants offering Japanese food and goods here"
Liang Court,4,It's a mall. It needs some signs at entrances to help you know what's is there and which floor it's on? It gets a four only because it's progressive enough to have a Bitcoin ATM.
Liang Court,4,"Nice, quiet, Japanese oriented mall. More for restaurants & supermarket...for shopping, you're better off elsewhere."
Liang Court,3,"Nice little place, clean and everyone I spoke to was friendly. There are bigger places to go but fine."
Liang Court,5,B1 has the best Japanese groceries in Singapore. Must visit here.
Liang Court,5,Lovely place with many Japanese shops. Bought very fresh fruits and meats from the grocer!
Liang Court,3,"Few places didn't accept USD and Forex card,"
Liang Court,4,My church used to hold its services here. Some food outlets just below the hotel and a shopping centre below making it convenient to meet for fellowship over lunch. Near MRT too.
Liang Court,3,It's kinda small. But quite cozy and got a lot of food chices. The Japanese section downstair is quite interesting.
Liang Court,3,Not a lot of stores so we didn't really buy ajything in this mall. But it's a good place to chill. There are also a lot of places to eat in the surrounding area.
Liang Court,3,"Used to be known as Little Japan in its early days but no more of that feel after revamp. However, it's a better alternative if you want some quietness away from the noise of nearby Clark Quay.

On the second level is an interesting shop which promotes essential oils + soap making. Have enrolled in a basic soap making course with part of the course fees that went to support a charity organisation! That's entrepreneurial!

Very interesting molds that can be used for soap and candles. After the basic course, you can book the facility to do yr own soap making to give away to friends. Suggest you book early if you want to give zodiac soaps or candles to relatives this Chinese New Year! Give a try and discover the talents or even the entrepreneur in you!"
Liang Court,5,Nice shopping with good staff service
Liang Court,4,Good family mall.. has lots of child friendly shops and food places. . Have 2 child themed kids gym too..
Liang Court,4,Gr8 japanese food stalls at the basement
Liang Court,3,Mall has seen better days. Good place to get Japanese groceries.
Liang Court,5,Ample car park space at Liang court!
Liang Court,5,"A place which is quiet and full of Japanese stuff. A good place to get your Japanese fix. A place to spend a lazy afternoon to have lunch, coffee, read books and buy groceries."
Liang Court,3,"This mall next to Novotel Hotel is popular among the Japanese for their groceries, food & clothes. Liang Court is a place to check it out if you like to shop for products from Japan."
Liang Court,5,"Great compact shopping mall with good facilities focusing on Japanese goods and produce. It also houses Meidi Ya, a specialty supermarket selling Japanese and international imported products."
Liang Court,4,"Great variety of food and apparel stores with a huge supermarket at basement where they offer great range of Japanese products and food stuff. Now that it's easily accessible via the downtown line, I'm sure more people will head over there as Clarke Quay is just beside it."
Liang Court,5,Great range of Japanese products and food. Very good Japanese food court at B1 outside Medi-ya.
Liang Court,1,Ghost town with MOST shops CLOSED. Should just close down this sad excuse of a mall
Liang Court,1,Good buy for Salmon fish head & bones..look for ice to keep fresh
Liang Court,5,Love all the japanese snacks at basement floor meidiya supermarket
Liang Court,3,"Not bad, quite convenient. The supermarket at the basement is good."
Liang Court,3,"A handful of shops still operating here.
So sad"
Liang Court,3,Just an average mall. Not a lot of Halal restaurant here. The mall are very close with Fort Canning mrt station.
Liang Court,4,Great Jap food place. Be careful of parking. Narrow roads so less skilled drivers better avoid.
Liang Court,5,Nice quit busy day time. 24 hours eating shops are available here
Liang Court,3,Dying place. Free motorcycle parking best
Liang Court,3,Average shopping place. Nothing much to hang around.
Liang Court,4,Japanese oriented Meidi-ya supermarket is the spot to get those hard-to-find Japanese ingredients. You'll spend time just browsing the aisles. The Uniqlo here seems to have quite an extensive range too.
Liang Court,3,"This mall is a little dark and confusing for my liking, but I visit because I'm in the Clarke Quay area a lot, and there's a nice Japanese supermarket (Meidi-ya) downstairs, a Japanese food court, Kinokuniya, and Uniqlo. The upper floors are mostly untenanted and quite empty. I always have difficulty finding the entrance because I come from the Clarke Quay area, but maybe that's just me!

Edit: Liang Court is soon going to be no more - visit if you want to capture old memories before it’s gone!"
Liang Court,3,Sad place that has it's share of better time.
Liang Court,4,I would go there for the Tamoya Udon. The udon is smooth n silky n there r several versions to choose from. You can enhance the flavour of the soup with garnishes (free). Price ia generally acceptable. Remember to return your bowls after u finished your meal.
Liang Court,5,"This place has many stores that are excellent, the food court here is cheap and the food is tasty and the supermarket offers great deals. There is a Starbucks for if you want to sit down and enjoy the cafe with friends or get a takeaway cup for on the road. The book store, kinokuniya is amazing and has so many books and stationary items. The mall being right next to the Novotel and Somerset makes it a great place to shop for tourists too!"
Liang Court,4,More Japanese food and supermarket.
Liang Court,3,Our family s favorite supermarket for quality and fresh food with a lot of preservative free food choices
Liang Court,3,Hope you're a good driver because the carpark is really narrow. Nice mix of Japanese restaurants. Not much what though. Near Fort Canning mrt
Liang Court,4,"One of the best malls to get your Japanese food craving fix although it’s very quiet. Also includes a very extensive supermarket. Only downside is it’s not very near the mrt, but about a 10 mins walk from Clarke Quay mrt will get you there."
Liang Court,3,"A place to go for some authentic Japanese foods as well as shopping for Japanese ingredients at Meidi-ya supermarket. The shopping mall itself is rather small and quiet, with not much events going on"
Liang Court,4,Great place to shop as there is a really big mall at the bottom floor filled with lots of japanese ingredients that would be a treat. The other floors have some really delicious restaurants and if you are a bookworm then the bookstore is a must go as it is filled with many novels and manga by popular japanese authors.
Liang Court,4,"Great place for Japanese shopping, has a great food store Meidi-Ya, good for Japanese food. Liang Court also has a great selection of restaurants and dining options"
Liang Court,3,Quite a number of shops closing down or closed. Hope that the new merchants coming in will bring the mall to live. Nothing much to shop except for Mediya at Basement.
Liang Court,5,Fairly priced food around. Meidi-ya in the basement is fantastic for Japanese groceries and snacks. Upper floors are pretty empty other than the Kino bookstore.
Liang Court,4,"The Japanese supermarket in the basement offers a huge variety of Japanese products. The highlight of this mall for me is Thirsty, a store on the first floor that sells craft beer. If you're into craft beer, you'll feel like a kid in a candy store."
Liang Court,4,"Selling Japanese food without  Japanese.
Ist floor selling multiple  foods near entrance  businesses is Good!
Clean n aircon is cold.
Beside Downtown Line."
Liang Court,4,Nice place for family visit.  Especially the revamped Japanese supermarket.  Not really a neighborhood mall as it lacks a hardware DIY shop.
Liang Court,3,Confusing layout but has all that you need. Can be busy at rimes. Its a mall tho..
Liang Court,4,"A place where clubbers and bar hoppers often find themselves after a late night out. McDonald's,  Subway, Starbucks and a Ramen joint is here.

During the day there's a cool Japanese supermarket there."
Liang Court,4,"Small Japanese orientated shopping mall, though stuff here not always the cheapest, but has a good choice of food options including excellent supermarket."
Liang Court,5,"As a korean traveller, It was a really really great place so I could get many korean snacks, beverage, kimchi, nuddle, ramen etc. Liang Court helped me reducing my baggage lol"
Liang Court,3,A huge supermarket selling plenty of Japanese goods. Ideal place to get Japan wine.
Liang Court,5,Liang court is an anomaly in Singapore. A hard-to-reach mall that seems to cater to the Japanese expat community in Singapore. It is a nice place to go to if you are a fan of Japanese food and shopping.
Liang Court,4,"Liang Court that was developed in the 80's attracted a Japanese community owing to it proximity to the Private apartments along RIver Valley area. Over time, owing to the changing economy, more and more Japanese retailers have dropped out. This was where MUJI opened a small shop even before having the name MUJI. Daimaru was once a modest departmental store here in SG. At the time of authorship, BOOKS KINOKUNIYA had announced leaving their tenancy during the same time Capitaland acquiring the property."
Liang Court,1,"Not much tenants,  mostly empty.  Except eateries"
Liang Court,5,"Great place with many nice food to eat. Especially if you love Japanese food, the chefs there are Japanese as well!"
Liang Court,5,PLS DON'T RENOVATE PLSSSS
Liang Court,5,"Comfortable community mall. Japanese themed. Clark Quay is just around the corner. MRT is a bit of a walk away, usually no issues getting a taxi."
Liang Court,5,Still has good Japanese supermarket.
Liang Court,2,Passed it's heydays. Scheduled to be torn down soon to make way for a new development.
Liang Court,3,Visit the Mall for the food courts. Not much shopping to be done. The Uni Qlo store usually has some deals.
Liang Court,3,Need more bus parking spaces. Many tourist tour buses causing jam at entrance
Liang Court,4,Place where Japanese imported products can be found. Price is relatively affordable and not too exorbitant
Liang Court,5,Love the supermarket and Japanese food outlets.
Liang Court,4,"Nice stay, you can view lazer show from this hotel"
Liang Court,2,"Went there for Jap cuisine mostly . Apart from Basement and 1st Floor. Nothing much but popular among resident living ard that area. Ever Since Audio house move out, its been quieter."
Liang Court,4,"In the '80s after Yaohan closed, this was the place to be for all things nippon (Japanese). It still is in some ways.  At least more than a handful of Japanese restaurants to chose from and even a Japanese books shop,  barber and outpatient clinic."
Liang Court,5,Nice walk to Sacred Heart Church
Liang Court,4,"Do visit if you like Japanese restaurants, quite a variety to select from. There is a jap super market where you can buy fruits that are flown in from Japan."
Liang Court,5,One of the Best place to buy premium Japanese import foods 😎
Liang Court,5,"This mall have been around for many years and provide alot of Japanese options.   Japanese barber,  Japanese DVD shop,  Japanese baker,  Japanese supermarket and bookshop.   Fantastic for folks that love Japanese stuff."
Liang Court,2,"Used to be a popular mall now left with just the Japanese supermarket, Medi-ya as the main draw."
Liang Court,5,Nice place but too many Japanese restaurant
Liang Court,4,"Food court, restaurants n shop. Products from Japan easily available here."
Liang Court,4,Pretty active mall. Quite a large variety of shops and eateries. Open quite late into the night as well.

Liang Court,1,Very run down. Disappointing

Liang Court,5,Ultimate Japanese retail mall in Singapore. Quiet and relaxing place to shop
Liang Court,5,"A perfect place to shop, dine and drink everything Japanese"
Liang Court,4,A shopping centre catered to Korean and Japanese Expat in Singapore
Liang Court,2,"Old, run down, and badly in need of a total renovation. Besides Meidi-ya and the Japanese restaurants, there are few stores of interest."
Liang Court,4,Nice mall with a lots of good Japanese restaurants.
Liang Court,4,"Very good for japanese food, and the Japanese supermarket. Omu rice in the basement is really good."
Liang Court,4,"I like this mall though to be honnest its quite small bit it makes it's 'charm'.  There are many Japanese restaurants, a Japanese bookstore, Japanese convenient store, a food court and many other shops like uniqlo... generally the mall is clean and not crowded, the only improvement needed is the toilets, not always at the right level of higiene ."
Liang Court,3,"Another less crowd mall, was here for dessert at Dulcat & Studio. The chiffon cake is recommended!"
Liang Court,5,Japanese curry at the Level 1 foodcourt is the ultimate comfort food!
Liang Court,5,"Since we had a little India, little Thailand & mini Malaysia...I Would like to consider this place as little Japan. Many Jap restaurants, bakeries & merchandise are available here. Especially, Meidiya supermarket!
Visited during Vesak day and was surprised that it isn't that crowded. Worth a visit as nowadays many places are too crowded."
Liang Court,4,"The stores are mainly japanese orientated and offers a good mix of retail, super market, restaurants and kinokuniya (book store). The car park is a bit small and driving up the ""narrow"" ramp may pose a challenge to new drivers. Accessible (5 mins walk max) by public transport either thru the MRT (train/subway) or buses."
Liang Court,5,"This mall has been here for decades, but has been refreshed and made modern. Has a wide selection of Japanese restaurants and food options,  not to mention the Japanese supermarket at the basement."
Liang Court,5,"Nice old school shopping mall, enjoyed coming here as a child."
Liang Court,4,Nice Place. You can find so many Japanese foods and beverages at here.
Liang Court,5,"Japanese theame shopping centre with lots of good food options as well as a large Japanese supermarket in the basement.  Located next to clarke quay, and under the novotel hotel."
Liang Court,5,"Mostly here just for Meidia (aka Japanese supermarket) and the udon speciality restaurant. But i actually realised there are many craft shops upstairs! Did one pottery one, knitting one, there's a beer craft one and a soap one. So it's pretty cool to check out!"

Liang Court,5,I like this shopping mall. can find a lot of Japanese food here.
Liang Court,1,Your salesperson by the name of Hazel is the most rudest Uniqlo employee we have encountered. My boyfriend and I are loyal Uniqlo customers. My pay wave transaction was having some issue for 10 seconds and she had to roll her eyes at me like it was big issue to her. Her customer service is awful.
Liang Court,3,"Japanese favored shopping mall. You could find Japan merchandise & groceries here.
Toilet hygiene to be improved"

Liang Court,4,"Nice place for Japanese food, supermarket and tuition centres. Good variety of shops as well"
Liang Court,1,Beddings smell and feels slightly damp. Complained to front desk and next day they changed the sheets and it's still the same. Furnishings were old and carpet needed a good cleaning.

Has plenty of food outlets and multiple cake stores. There's a grocery store on the basement level and the whole mall has a very Japanese vibe.
The shopping mall is right next to the Fort Canning MRT which gives you access to the downtown line which can take you directly to Expo (stop before Changi airport) which is super convenient.
There is a uniqlo as well but its more of a foody place"
Liang Court,4,Good food.. fish ball noodles recommended
Liang Court,5,"Great variety of high quality Japanese restaurants,  supermarket,  shops. Ample parking."
Liang Court,5,Mediya is a good super market for buying raw fishes
Liang Court,5,Hokkiado soft serve is a must try
Liang Court,2,Most of the shops at level 2 and above are vacant. Only reason to visit this place is for the Japanese supermarket at basement.
Liang Court,4,"Happy that the downtown line now brings people here more easily, at the Fort Canning station. People come here to shop at Medi-ya, for a wide range of Japanese imported products. There's also Saizeriya, one of the earliest ones to be open in Singapore, for gatherings. Located just beside Novotel, this brings convenience to visitors so that they can shop and eat here. Tampopo is an awesome ramen place, the high SES version of Marutama one floor above. The disconnect is that Liang Court, sounding like a Chinese investment property, is actually more Japanese in its shops. There's a Uniqlo that wasn't open on a Monday evening too. A popular KTV place, Partyworld, offers other activities for people who decided at the last minute that clubbing isn't for them after all."
Liang Court,5,"Shopping mall mainly for the Japanese crowd. Authentic Japanese food can be found here, it is also home to the closest 7-11 to clarke quay. Starbucks is also here if you want to get away from the clubbers for awhile. Level 1 has a 24 hour eatery for after clubbing food. Atms can also be found near 7-11. Next to fort canning mrt."
Liang Court,5,Superb place to chill or warm up before the nights party.
Liang Court,2,Quite a bit of variety with the shops and reasonable value but shocking service in the food court
Liang Court,2,"overrated. $13 for a bowl of  normal ramen. imo, not worth + not say v nice ?? like it’s just avg, as good as ajisen’s. the cha shu was better than the ramen. grilled gyoza was not bad too. will not specially come back here. service wise is good"
Liang Court,5,Great mall to get your Japanese stuff in SG.
Liang Court,5,Nice place to walk and spent good time with beloved ones
Liang Court,4,Good place for Japanese food. Too bad it's going to be gone soon.
Liang Court,5,"Fantastic Japanese Supermarket, Meidi Ya. Has a fantastic variety of Japanese products and fresh produce from Japan and different parts of the world. Conveniently situated in Liang Court, next to Clarke's Quay.  Oustanding quality."
Liang Court,4,Love this mall. They have Japanese supermarket at basement where you can find all goods from Japan. Some staff are japanese hence they don't speak english very well.
Liang Court,4,A popular Japanese supermarket and delikatessen in this shopping mall is Meidi-Ya supermarket offering a very wide range of Japanese and local products.
Liang Court,5,"Good place to go if you want to see some Japanese cultures in Singapore. Very good Japanese restaurants. Please try out Butadon, a grilled pork rice bowl restaurant. Nirai-Kanai serves amazing Okinawan dishes  in an intricately designed interior. You'll feel like you're in a different country."
Liang Court,4,The tomato and cheese omurice at the omurice stall in the corner just outside of the supermarket's entrance in the basement is amazing
Liang Court,4,Meidi-ya is a great supermarket. You can still  find good deals among the more expensive grocery items.
Liang Court,1,"Many shops closed. Facilities not well maintained. Unless you have in mind which shop you are visiting, it is now a shade of it's former self."
Liang Court,4,The udon is good!
Liang Court,5,"Quiet place for a meal even during lunch hours, highly recommended!"
Liang Court,5,Liang court has its unique seafood we love to buy.....all import from japan..its will come once a week on friday...all the seafood was so fresh n its much cheapers compare to others place....
Liang Court,4,"Liang Court situated at the cross roads of the bustling CBD area and the quaint River Valley stretch.

The mall is centered on the Japanese culture and you would find the household name supermarket ""Meidi-Ya"" at the basement. It's not the cheapest supermarket around but you can most definitely find Japanese imported products here and their seafood looks, smells and tastes super fresh!

However, I could imagine with many other malls starting to focus on the Japanese culture, it might boil down to price and location that would determine the eventual human traffic. Especially, with Don Don Donki and their heavy focus on marketing.

Most patrons to the mall would find themselves predominantly wandering around the basement level and level one for the supermarket and the various restaurants around.

It's a mall that you would probably spend at most a couple of hours at since the retail shops are underwhelming (apart from Uniqlo). But if Japanese culture and food is your thing, then hop on by and check it out one day!"
Liang Court,5,It's a pretty but well establish shopping center mostly dedicated to Japanese food and the Japanese community.
Liang Court,1,Shops mostly empty now. Time for makeover. Not a place to visit now.
Liang Court,3,Best udon shop
Liang Court,5,"After many years, I still love Liang court. Now the basement have one full Japan supermarket with great variety"
Liang Court,4,It's the least crowded mall in central area and has a lot to offer.
Liang Court,4,"One of the better supermarket, selling their priced beef, fish and the seasonal japanese fruits!"
Liang Court,4,"Japanese-centric mall, can be quite pricey generally but at least its all under one roof. Good variety of restaurants across price ranges.

Meidi-ya at the basement is a good supermarket to discover variants of items not usually seen at normal supermarkets. Extensive collection of snacks like kettle chips in many more flavours than available at fairprice outlets.

Ground floor has a good and affordable udon outlet as well. If you're looking for sth local, check out the food court just at the entrance next to McDonald's."
Liang Court,4,"Apart from Meidi Ya, the mix of restaurants and shops here are also slightly different from the usual malls, an interesting place to shop"
Liang Court,5,Easy to find based on the map and directions returned
Liang Court,3,"1. It's located in happening place
2. Near to the MRT

Liang Court,4,"Centrally located hotel, service apartment and shopping mall under one roof. Boat quay for eatery and chill out in the surrounding areas."
Liang Court,4,"I like the Japanese stuff at basement and level 1, foodcourt food quality quite good. Other than that, nothing interesting."
Liang Court,5,"There for Tampopo dinner, great food and service. Mediya must go visit For june holidays they have this ufo catcher free game when you spend above 20 there. Great fun for the kids."

Liang Court,5,"Old place but looks like new with renovated and clean toilets, lifts and escalators. Try out the udon and shop at uniqlo"
Liang Court,5,"Meidi-Ya! Yes, there is none other than this well-stocked Japanese supermarket! Bought all things necessary to make Japanese cuisine at home from here. Such therapeutic experience! Oh, and when I'm lazy to make Japanese food, I'll drop in Tampopo... feels like I'm back in Japan!"

Liang Court,2,Not very good except for a few jap restaurants
Liang Court,3,okay..not bad
Liang Court,3,"Like a tired sleepy old lady....just beside the vibrant Clark Quay, but once inside, it is like a heartland mall in Sengkang."
Liang Court,1,They need to tear this down and start again. And this time place your AC somewhere else because it’s blasting in customers faces before they walk in
Liang Court,4,Great shopping mall for all Japanese food and shopping.
Liang Court,3,"We stayed at Novotel Clarke Quay just around the corner, and thats how we came across this place. Our first local cousine and 4 dishes we ordered were all good but wouldnt call it fantastic. No card accepted and cash only. Even the 7/11 would only take local cards not international ones."
Liang Court,5,"Many of my first and lifetime etched memories from childhood till adulthood. The mall nicely evolved along with my time haha, it's an expirencial mall."
Liang Court,4,"Meidi-ya a Japanese grocery store, has lots of high quality goods from Japan!"
Liang Court,5,Two authentic Okinawan and Sushi restuarants are housed in the basement. And it doesn't burn your pocket! Freshest and cheapest sashimi available in Meidi-Ya market

Head down to the basement for Meidi-ya, a grocery market stocked with Japanese and other international treats. Of course, you'll need to visit the sushi and sashimi section.

Liang Court,4,This is the place to go for Japanese food and shopping. It boasts many Japanese restaurants and the Meidi-Ya supermarket is the place to go for fresh seafood and Japanese groceries. But get ready for the crowds at the weekend. The Kinokuniya book store offers a large selection of books for bookworms too. Only gripe is the challenging carpark for bigger vehicles.

Poorly designed car park entry and exit. The ERP carpark Gantry poorly place the sensors which deduct your cashcard even before you reach the gantry.

Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,An absolute wow...  It is so serene & peaceful here..the clouds added to the calm..by far the most tranquil of the parks & reservoirs I have been to...just note that it is an open park nearby a golf course with not many scattered small shelters... but hey u can always go commando...sit on the grass..enjoy nature 😉
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"Breathtaking afternoon experience at Upper Seletar Reservoir! Calm waters, extremely perfect for picinics with family and friends. The adjacent golf course was surrounded by trees similar-looking to broccoli. Isn't it amazing? The trees boasted of different hues of green, which was very calming to the eyes. We waited for sunset. Skies turned orange and slowly, darkness kissed the remaining visitors of the Reservoir. We capped the night with dinner on the moist green grass."
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"A nice place to walk or jog..
Beautiful sunrise and sunset"
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Famous wedding shoot location thanks to the lone tree planted against a picturesque backdrop of a blue sky and calm waters. There's also a viewing tower you can climb up to enjoy a bird's eye view of the scenery here. Great place to jog as there's a long jogging track and also great place to have a picnic - I see many families picnicking here. Toilet's a short 5min walk away and there's a good amount of carpark lots here so overall a convenient & beautiful place to chill & catch the sunrise/sunset.
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Peaceful place for a run but you would need to repeat to hit more than 2km.
Upper Seletar Reservoir,4,"Tranquil spot for chillin’. Not much shade around, so best to visit in the late afternoon or before noon. Best thing about this place is you feel like you’re in a different country when you’re there. It just looks… different."
Upper Seletar Reservoir,4,Stunning view Sunsets!It gonna be romantic places for a picnic couple 😍
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Nice place to cycle or take a hike to. It is worth the effort to go all the way in. It was a tough ride due to the steep slopes but definately worth to see such a beautiful view of the Reservoir.
Upper Seletar Reservoir,3,Not much attraction here apart from the rocket tower and walk around. Also it is out of the way so need private transport to come here
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Very peaceful place for me.
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Lovely place to walk in the outdoors as you admire a large expanse of water and if you're lucky a nice sunset too. Be careful of the wild monkeys at the far end.
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"Wonderful because of the serenity afforded by the more out of the way location. Great paths for walking, running, and cycling right by the water. The Seletar Rocket Tower is a nice landmark with a great view across the reservoir and the patch below is a wonderful spot for a picnic."
Upper Seletar Reservoir,4,"A peaceful oasis in Singapore... best kept a ""secret"". But accessibility is not convenient without personal transport. Nice to visit especially early morning or late afternoon. This is a sunset place (photographers take note). :)"
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"Very calming, relaxing and beautiful"
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,A Milestone place to the next phase of my life! Enjoy the beautiful scenery and wonderful atmosphere ~
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"One of the free parks that spans for a longgggg stretch.

Great place to jog, cycle or even just walk. This is definitely something almost anyone can do with everyone. Even those on wheelchair, yay!

The parking space is also equally big and spacious. Not forgetting that the parking place has a toilet beside it should u suddenly need to settle nature's call just before you start your journey.

There is also a rocket tower that looked like that it will transport u to a timeline in the past. And yes, climbing to the top is possible. The view is just slightly above the canopy of the trees BUT never a disappointment. Definitely a place to go for inspiration and life motivation. The stretch of the road is also pretty to be at, during the right timing. As u can see the photos contributed, not just by us, by others as well. A lovely place for nature at its best.

We came when it was about to rain and it rained while we were there and we continued after it rained too..hehehe.. So ya, it was a great experience here..😀

Take note one thing, there is limited sheltered area should it rain. Just make sure u are well-prepared before coming here. And oya, there is no direct public transport like Bedok Reservoir park.. So u guys need to drive here..

Cheers

Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,Very cool and quiet ambience in morning
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"Ok so all y'all think just because you're at gbtb or somewhere way central you think you got good sunset? Well rethink your life. After almost 3 decades of living in Singapore, I can safely say this has to be one of the top places to see the sunset, despite the close proximity of the columbarium (rip to the souls). And also the tower makes the sunset view futher superior.

The remoteness brings about tranquility and parking is free! Sadly, you're gonna need a vehicle or a bicycle to get here cause it's deep inside mandai.

Well I guess good things in life don't come for free."

Upper Seletar Reservoir,4,"Relatively secluded nature park with the iconic rocket tower and the mini-instagram lone tree (near the tower). The trees are space quite far apart for their size, so you can frame it as a single tree for a photo. That said, it's secludedness invites strange folks who drive all the way here in the dead of the night to engage in activities other than walking/running/photography in the park. Also one may expect to see monkeys and wild boars in the area too."
Upper Seletar Reservoir,5,"Upper Seletar Reservoir Park is Singapore's 3rd impounding reservoir after MacRitchie Reservoir and Peirce Reservoir that can be found at Mandai Road Track 7 which is off Mandai Road which is located within the Central Water Catchment area of Singapore island. The reservoir was formerly known as Seletar Reservoir, before the completion of the Lower Seletar Reservoir near Nee Soon which was formed by the damming up of the mouth of Seletar River, in 1986. The Seletar Reservoir was built to meet the surge in water demand after World War I. Built while David Joseph Murnane was Municipal Water Engineer, a contemporary description of the project scope and construction in 1939 is included in the footnote. The construction work was overseen by Murnane's deputy F. G. Hill. The reservoir was completed in 1940 and officially opened on 10 August 1969 by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. It also covers a large expanse of open space on the eastern side of the reservoir. The 15-hectare park was completed in 1973. This reservoir park features a viewing tower, and is a frequent venue for joggers, walkers and fishing enthusiasts. This reservoir park overlooks the Night Safari and the Singapore Zoo. The signboards saying ""Beware of Crocodiles"" are found in this reservoir to prevent the people from going near the crocodiles. To get to this reservoir park by public bus, take SBS Transit bus service 138 from Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange and alight at the bus stop 48089 (Upper Seletar Reservoir) which is along Mandai Road."

Admiralty Park,5,"Great for family with young kids. Various playground for them to spend their time. Also a good place for a walk. The whole park is surrounded with trees - shady and cooling. Hungry for more ?  Woodlands Waterfront Park is just next to it ,offering a different  experience."
Admiralty Park,5,Great place for a trail walk. Suitable for all ages. Mostly flat trails. Can get hot and humid if you are planning to walk to the woodlands waterfront park as well so best bring a cap. Can get crowded during weekends but very peaceful on weekdays with regular joggers.
Admiralty Park,5,It has the most number of slides and is a child's dream playground. The nature park is tranquil with lots of shade. The mangrove walk is memorable. Be careful of monkeys though.
Admiralty Park,4,You can find a lot of slides for children all age. You can also find mangrove trees and the waterfront view where you can see Malaysia.

Very well maintained park. Lots of greenery on the trails."
Admiralty Park,5,nice and spacious and wasn't too crowded. the kids spent more than 2 hours just running up and down these slides and didn't have enough. there are smaller slides and simple walls for younger tots as well!
Admiralty Park,5,"Slides,  slides and more slides. Exciting
Outdoor playground for kids.
Getting there : board 903 from woodlands bus Interchange and get down at Progen building (2 stops) or board 169 and get down at republic poly (2 stops)

Things to do:
1) Park is on hill terrain and designed like multi-tier theme and has two play areas one for juniors and the other for 5-10 years old.
2) biggest attraction is long metallic double barrel slides for kids to race.
3) slides at multiple levels and nets or climbing to move from one to another level.
4) personally my son liked roller-type slide.
5 ) wave shaped slide with nets to climb.
6) family swing, bridge with cargo net and many more.

Do take note to carry food for kids as only place to buy food and drinks is Cheers. Subway was closed on weekend.

I recommend this place for kids."
Admiralty Park,5,Alot of slides for kids and a forested area around a stream. Yet to explore fully but it's an exciting find. Rainwater pond has turtles and there's a restaurant and vending machine.

Admiralty Park,3,"Great place for kids. It's packed most of the time but it's also free to use, so what do you expect?"

Couples stroll along the shades and coolness of the trees. Nearby there is a restaurant, but it's close now due to pandemic dining ruling. Behind it is Republic Polytechnic, it's always open to be check out if you've not been there."
Admiralty Park,5,Marvelous place for kids to enjoy. Outdoor activities definitely better than video games.
Admiralty Park,5,"A park with lots of different slides for kids from 5-12 years old. There are also a lots of swings, climbing nets and sand ground for your kids to spend for new hours there. Good things is that there are many table and chair under the big trees with big shade which is good. A short and easy track way if you like nature (Lots of shade on the way) can connect to Woodland Waterfront Park. Not too many people which is good."
Admiralty Park,5,Nice place for kids. They'll enjoy it

Admiralty Park,4,Good place for taking a walk.

Admiralty Park,5,Nicely forested Park with two linking bridges across the small streams. The canopy is high giving you a view out of the urban. It is well connected to waterfront Park.
Admiralty Park,5,"This is a playground with a huge playground. Kids will go bonkers with the playground alone. For parents of young kids u have yo run around a lot....

Lots of beaches around. There is also a sand playground which is much less crowded.

Walk further away gro  capark .. it gets quiet. Bring a mat and picnic under trees"
Admiralty Park,5,Very nice place. My kids enjoy them and so did my husband and I. Just advise u to wear sports shoes. I end up hurting my toe and so did my boys. But really nice place. A HUGEEEE playground for everyone 😊

Admiralty Park,5,"I must be thankful that my friend brought me here. The park is conveniently located beside Republic Poly (RP). There are so many facilities for kids and of course for family outings.

Regardless if you need sandy playground or carpeted. This place has it all. Had only brief through abit of this place will explore again soon."
Admiralty Park,5,"Excellent park - large, clean and fun. Minimum at 5 years old, based on the signs. A great workout for a kid and guaranteed to tire them out. The only downside is it's around Woodlands so pretty far out of town."
Admiralty Park,5,"Great variety of slides, Climbing areas, sand playgrounds and ample number of swings for your child to let some steam off. It never seems crowded because the place is very well planned. Another thoughtful feature is sufficient benches and tables for parents which most parks miss. I would highly recommend this place! Eating options are just a stone’s throw away at either Republic Poly or Causeway point mall (across the road). A quick trip to the nearby Sembawang Hot Springs (short cab ride) is a good experience for the little ones!"
Admiralty Park,3,"I have been reading so much about the slides and all here for some time. So I went there with huge expectation. I spent almost 1 hr 30 mins travelling to the park. But it was not what I had expected. Having said that, the play area is buzzing. Kids did enjoy. But I was hoping for some really extra ordinary experience."
Admiralty Park,5,Nice place to walk. Not many people. U can take bus service number 903 from woodlands interchange and alight either at second or third stop depending which part you’re heading. Its not a very long way in. But just be prepared with mosquito repellent since its mangrove area.

In the park a little eco mangrove swamp is waiting to be explored.
Admiralty Park,4,Lots of fun facilities for kids and family. Good place for family to hang out. Just watch out for cyclist if you have small kids

The park is just a walking distance from Woodlands MRT station and you can also take bus 903 from Woodlands Bus interchange and align 2 stops later. You can start your walk from the Park entrance at the main entrance of Republic Polytechnic all the way to Admiralty Road and cross to Woodlands Waterfront Park. After your morning exercise, remember to stop by for breakfast at Marsiling Lane Hawker Center. There for plenty of good food awaiting for you."
Admiralty Park,4,Its super fun place to bring kids outdoors. But i guess for most parents to note to bring mosquitoes repellent. And also have your kids wear proper shoes.

Due to covid some slide close.  Good to enjoy nature.  Still a great place to be than in shopping mall."
Admiralty Park,4,"Love this park. There are plenty of slides for 2 and above. The park has a carpark nearby & toilet is about 100m walk, equipped with watercooler as well. As the park is right behind Republic Poly, there is a Cheers outlet located about 50m from the toilet, but is only open on weekdays (following campus hours). The large trees at the park makes it pretty shady as well during the afternoon sun."
Admiralty Park,5,Oh! What a lovely experience with the kids. Many slides (at least 5) with one that is 3 storeys high! A wonderful place to bring the kids. With toilet nearby.

Admiralty Park,5,"Located near Woodlands MRT, and beside Republic Polytechnic, this park is conveniently accessible by residents of nearby neighborhood.

This park sport jogging track, cycling track, swings and slides and even mangroves. It is also home to squirrels and monkeys (feeding monkey is an offence). In between your trek, you will be greeted with shelters located in intervals to allow one to recuperate and seek shelter for the moment. Some shelters also have toilets and vending machine to buy drinks at their own convenience.

A good place to be if one needs to unwind. It breathes an aura of peace and tranquility that can be felt with nature."

There is also junior play area (below 5 yo). Amazingly, this park also wheel swing for people with wheel chair. Credit to the management. Don't forget to bring your water bottle. You can refill water from tap water in the toilet area next to the junior play. If you plan to visit Singapore with kids, admiralty park playground should be listed as one of place to visit."
Admiralty Park,5,"'Best playground we've visited in Singapore'. Not my words but the words of our 4 year old daughter. Lots to do, shaded areas to sit, nature to look at and space to run around in. Great afternoon/evening out with the kids! 100% going back, we have no choice..."

That aside there is lots to keep them occupied, not much shade and best to take plenty of water."

Sometimes we just need to Slow Down and Observe what is around us. We may realize that we might have missed out many things. As simple as the route From Your Home to Work, Camp or School"
Admiralty Park,5,"I brought my 3yo nephew to admiralty park & we really really REALLY enjoyed ourselves. There’s a section where it’s meant for younger kids to play around in the sand pit & swings. So this picture shows the longest slide in the park, which is meant for 5-12yo. Do note not to let kids >5 run around on their own. I wish I’m a kid again."

Admiralty Park,5,"Huge fun park with lots of slides huge and small. Different site catering to kids of different ages. As it is situated next to Republic Poly, can just walk a short distance to Subway there as well. Some spots quite hot without shades. However, there are shelter with seats next to play area as well where you can take rest. Only thing I am not sure if there are any toilet nearby for wash up coz one kids play area is sand ground. Overall, a fun family place for some real sweat out 😀"
Admiralty Park,4,"Commenting on the public playground only. It is closer to the southern and western entrances. Very crowded on a weekend. So many fun slides. The two longest ones and the adventure play area were closed for repairs. In the junior play area, there were only 3 swings... and only 2 in the entire area for very small kids. The roundabout was closed for repairs. I did not find facility for drinking water. Toilets were decent. Parents and/or older siblings must accompany smaller kids. Overall good."

But it is definitely worth the trip and it is free to play at the playground!"
Admiralty Park,5,Good place for strolls and walks
Admiralty Park,3,Slides are fun for the kids but they do get bored after a while.

Admiralty Park,4,"One of the better park especially the playground area for kids 5-12years old. Park with lots of shades from trees with large play area, slides, swings and tunnels. Enough benches with shelter for guardians to keep watchful eyes over their wards. Sands area abound so not recommended to wear socks and shoes. Playground areas are kids and wheelchair friendly. In fact, first time seen a swing for wheelchair. Free public toilet area provide a welcoming place to clean up as well as relief, even comes with 2 water coolers to hydrate oneself. As with all parks, watch out for the bicycles."
Admiralty Park,4,"Went at night. Not much people, which was good as the rides and playgrounds were vacant for kids to ride. Though there were street lamps, it was quite dark. Bus stops conveniently nearby. Only problems were the roller slides. When your speed is decently fast, the rollers will hurt your bones. Instructions for it were to sit down on the roller, but that only made it more uncomfortable. Otherwise, park was better than expectations. Would recommend to visit for anyone in Singapore for a taste of our parks."
Admiralty Park,4,Great for kids. But not suitable for hot weather
Admiralty Park,4,Sunset across the Causeway
Admiralty Park,5,"Great place for the entire family to spend a half-day. It's easy to access, 2 or 3 stops from the woodlands MRT station. It has two parts; one ""noisy"" part is centered around two children playgrounds; the other consists of paved paths across quiet woods, good for jogging. In between the two parts there is a buffet restaurant (appearing closed due to Covid the day I am there) .

I have to say one of the playground, built against a slope, is very interesting and adventurous, suitable for teenagers and (when not crowded with kids) adults. You can climb up the slope and come down inside a tube shaped metal slide. The slope is quite deep,  and the top is probably 4-5 storey high above the ground. So sliding down is very exhilarating.

Jogging alone along the quiet woods could be a little scary in the evening, I guess. Basically you are running along 1-meter wide small path, and surrounded with tress with tropical smells. No visibility of any buildings and mains roads, although they are just near by. So if you really want to do it in the evening, go jogging with friends."
Admiralty Park,5,Has monyets. Note: Part of the park is completely unlit at night.
Admiralty Park,5,Kids loved the slides.
Admiralty Park,5,excellent n tranquil park

Admiralty Park,5,Themes park for kids n children many many more to enjoy. A must visit place to go...

Some slides are too big and high for them. Got to prepare sunblock, lots of water to stay hydrated during hot weather. May have to bring along an umbrella just in case it rains. It's a bit of walking distance from carpark and not that much shelter."

Admiralty Park,3,"The park is awesome but it can do better such as providing facilities like showers as the kids after long day of fun, it is best for them to be showered especially after playing at the sand pits. Can add some vending machines for those who are thirsty."
Admiralty Park,5,Great natural walk
Admiralty Park,5,A lot of long slides which suitable for 5-12years old and my kids enjoys the playground very much. The green slide at the top is a bit dangerous for my 4 yo kids but the rest are well designed. There are rock climbing facility are well designed and my 3 yo kids are fine with that too. We usually visit the park during weekends morning 9am and it's a bit hot & mosquitos around. Recommended to bring own handheld fan. Mosquito patch doesn't help much during our visit and I found medicine oil (lemongrass oil) is good. Parking is just next to the playground and walking around 2-3mins. I saw some kids learning scooter and balance bike around that area. Good place for kids to play around and I will recommend to everyone who kids love playground.
Admiralty Park,5,This is a kid's haven. Go at dawn or at dusk to avoid the heat.
Admiralty Park,5,"Excellent park with some of the best playgrounds I've seen. There are two main playgrounds, one that is suitable for ages 5-12, and another for 2-5. Both are excellent. I've also captured photospheres of each of the playgrounds so you can see how extensive it is. Worth a trip if you are in the area.

Nearby there is Republic Polytechnic, which has a food court and a Subway to grab food in case you get hungry."
Admiralty Park,4,"Good park for jogging while kids can enjoy playing the facilities here especially the slides.
Avoid going on weekend evening as car park lot is limited."

Admiralty Park,5,Nice place to bring kids
Admiralty Park,3,"great park in Singapore but under provisioned!

the park have a very high capacity but the amenities are just barely enough.

only 1 washroom,  no wash taps and washrooms next to the playgrounds, not enough seating areas for the elderly and family.

the car park slots are really not enough and it's like just for show.

not enough sun shades on the play ground itself and during a sunny day. the play ground equipment and the children will be like baking under the hot sun.

it's right next to republic polytechnic but the school blocks of the roads so no one can park in the school to access the admiralty park and playground.

what a waste of government efforts to be family friendly park.

i gave it a 3 stars is because the park is really nice to go but the supporting infrastructure is really bare and lousy.  it's like for show. dated jan 2020.

i hope the MP or government can quickly add in the missing items listed above.

should have these kind of play grounds at bishan park and tampines areas near IKEA"

Admiralty Park,5,"This must be the best playground we have visited in Singapore! My son, 8 years old, really enjoyed the two playgrounds that are right here at the beginning of the park.
The first one for a bit smaller kids and the next one for the bigger kids. Some of the slides are really fast! It was raining a bit when we were there so some of the playground things gets quite slippery so watch out!"

Admiralty Park,4,Great place to hangout with your close buddies. Ample seating space for hosting a small picnic if you're into that kind of thing. Mosquitos are aplenty and I got quite a few bites from my short 2 hour sesh there. (Maybe I'm too sweet already 👀)
Admiralty Park,4,Nice place but not enuff restroom.
Admiralty Park,4,"As a park it has inadequate big open spaces for the kids to run amok but 8t is mainly due to the terrain so the kids get to roll downhill instead! The facilities, compared to other countries would be awesome but it's so so only for a Singaporean park. It's really really short of amenities like shops and tidbits stands. The crowd is not overwhelming which maybe the reason of not many small businesses here.
5 stars for the fun the terrain 9ffered.
3 stars for the man made play tools
3 stars for the overall amenities and facilities
4 stars average!"

National Park works closely with neighbouring Republic Polytechnic, which is also the adopter of the park under the adopt-a-park scheme. One collaboration with them has been the Admiralty Park E-Guide, an online guide to the plants in the park produced by students from the School of Applied Science.

Admiralty Park,5,Nice and peaceful place. Very good for kids. There are lots of playing activity items for kids
Admiralty Park,4,Too many playing options for children...
Admiralty Park,5,"Great playground for kids above 6 years old - it has many different varieties of “obstacles” which helped to train your children’s mobility skills and balancing skills.

There are slides of various lengths and speed,  and a small flying fox.  The whole place is carpeted with soft,  colourful rubber which absorbs shock.  The toilets are clean.  The place is lined with clean benches and small pavilions.  It is lined with trees and had a small nature Park at the side.  A great place to scooter,  cycle,  play and have a nice family time with kids."

Admiralty Park,4,"Fun, but hot and humid"
Admiralty Park,5,Nice place for jogging and relax
Admiralty Park,5,"Never seen so many slides in an area before. Both main play areas (for kids between 2 - 5 years, and 5 - 12 years) are sufficiently challenging for kids in the age groups. Having the infrastructure is one thing, the factor that makes playground fun is the presence of other kids. So while it may be more crowded on weekends, it's probably a better idea to bring them down for a more memorable playtime"
Admiralty Park,5,"This place could drive your young kids crazy.. they would love the playground with a lot of slides..  the run up and down would make their body work harder and great satisfaction to enjoy fast slide, longer climbing stairs, children friendly wall climb.. no fast food store near by, do remember to bring enough water and snack.. car parking lot was limited, do park at republic polytechnic guest car park as alternative car park..  if u want to have picnic and relax at the park while watch your kids go wild, that is possible.. get a right spot to be able to see the kids, set the safety rule.. this is definitely a good place to hang with kids. Enjoy!!"

Admiralty Park,4,"Great greenery and now there’s a new slide park for kids. There’s also a halal international buffet for hungry park goers.

Admiralty Park,5,"It is indeed a great park for families as it has slides and such but when it comes to normal hang out place, it could be improved! The nature park reserve was also quite serene!"
Admiralty Park,4,New playground for kids is fun. But too much twits and sometimes you could find caterpillar at the playground. Else I would have given 5 stars.
Admiralty Park,4,"Slides galore for kids. Many types of trees to see and walk past.

Be careful for the monkeys that can intimidate - secure your bags properly and be watchful.

The northern end around Woodlands Waterfront isn't lit for night walks, and the pathway there also needs improvement as they're just packed gravel for now."
Admiralty Park,5,"One of my favorite parks in Singapore. It is off the beaten path for tourists but definitely worth a detour. The mangrove forest is a hidden gem and the stroll along the Sungei Cina is very pleasant. Lots of wildlife, including many bird species, turtles, mudskippers, and even wild boars."

There is a playground in the park with long slides. The play area makes use of the terrain to allow children (and adults) to climb about and slide down via a variety of slides. Families with children must make it a point to visit this park solely for the play area."
Admiralty Park,5,A nice place for jogging or cycling. The playground is very big - great for kids

Admiralty Park,1,Unfortunately large areas of the park were under 'construction' (Dec 2016) which meant we were directed out of the park at some points and were forced to double-back on ourselves at others.

Admiralty Park,4,"With a newly installed playground, this park has attracted more human traffic these days compared to the times when it was just a plain park with just a buffet restaurant, Sakura, as a main attraction.

The pond in the center has been either badly polluted or horribly maintained. At one end, streaks of oil can be seen floating on the water (nearer to the toilets).

The otters can be spotted occasionally at the river near the first wooden bridge after walking past the murky pond.

Nearer to the further end away from Ave 9, there used to be this tiny drain/stream with lots of fishes in it. But after a recent stroll to that place, the whole place was overgrown with weeds and the fishes seemed to have all died too. So sad to see a beautiful place with wildlife just die out due to neglect"

Pulau Semakau,5,Semakau island is good example of micro grid aplication in Singapore
Pulau Semakau,5,It looks and is so beautiful. I cannot believe that this island is a landfill. You will be forgiven to think this is a getaway relaxation resort island at first glance
Pulau Semakau,4,"Most of the unrecyclable trash in Singapore are thrown here to be processed. The island cannot handle lots of trash, so lets conserve and not use a lot of plastic."
Pulau Semakau,5,Biggest landfill island .... View from shell bukom island .....
Pulau Semakau,5,Good experience of where all the trash are placed
Pulau Semakau,4,"Been here for research. The Semakau Landfill is Singapore's first and only landfill situated offshore among the southern islands of Singapore. It covers a total area of 3.5 square kilometres and has a capacity of 63 million m³. To create the required landfill space, a 7 km perimeter rock bund was built to enclose a part of the sea between Pulau Semakau and Pulau Sakeng. As of August 2011 it was estimated that the landfill, which began operations on 1 Apr 1999, will last until 2045"
Pulau Semakau,5,"Semakau Island is a waste landfill for Singapore. It is currently still in operation and can last us till 2035. The island does not look like a landfill as it is filled with grass and natural landscape.

You need to visit this place to find out more on the history of waste management in Singapore. It had evolve and it utilize the latest technology to keep the landfill beautify.

There is a visitor centre on the island to let visitors understand the history and operation concept.

The visit is limited to Singaporeans and PR. Others can only visit unless it is specially granted by NEA. Daily visit are limited and you need to apply for the visit with NEA."

Pulau Semakau,5,Such a amazing place
Pulau Semakau,5,"This is our only landfill, we should recycle trash, if we keep throwing away things, Semaku landfill would be full. We should reuse, reduce, recycle and we need to appreciate what we have. When it comes to recycling, throw CLEAN stuff, BUT NOT ALL clean stuff, as ONLY glass, paper, plastic, BUT NOT ALL kinds of plastic, aluminium, and SOME types of metal."
Pulau Semakau,5,"Lovely Island. The 7 kilometres stretch of roads created on Pulau Semakau, is the MOST expensive ever made in Singapore, costing $460 million SGP dollars. The total cost of the reclaimed land from the sea was $610 million SGP dollars."
Pulau Semakau,5,Very good. Clean waters around the island.
Pulau Semakau,4,"More opportunities should be given for Singaporeans to visit because it really tells us how much trash we are throwing and make us realise we have to stop wasting.

To get here is not easy. Can try find thru NEA website or thru bird watching or inter tidal walking groups etc."

Pulau Semakau,4,A beautiful place for rubbish ash.
Pulau Semakau,5,Seeing how Singapore managed its waste is an eye opener indeed.
Pulau Semakau,5,If you're fishing. ;)
Pulau Semakau,5,"Like they said, the most expensive road runs through this tiny island."
Pulau Semakau,3,it is a rubbish land but looks like park when u go there

Lower Seletar Reservoir,5,"With a surface area of 3.6 km², and a capacity of 9.5 million m³, it has a 14.3 km long shoreline.

A little peek into the history guides us that the Lower Seletar Reservoir was constructed under the Sungei Seletar/Bedok Water Scheme, completed in 1986. The scheme involved the damming of Sungei Seletar to form Lower Seletar Reservoir, the creation of Bedok Reservoir from a former sand quarry and the construction of Bedok Waterworks. Its unique feature was the construction of nine stormwater collection stations to tap the storm runoffs of the surrounding urbanised catchments.

What’s amusing is that alongside the northern shore of Lower Seletar Reservoir, there is the Lower Seletar Reservoir Park with some undulating terrain that provides a pleasant place for a leisurely stroll or jog. You can find benches along the edge of the reservoir if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the beautiful view of the reservoir.

The park, is equipped with a jetty, shelters, restrooms, and a 1.3 km jogging track.

Indeed a great kick-start to our trip. Looking forward to creating some cherished memories with my loved ones."

Downtown East,4,"Downtown east is a place catered mostly to kids, with playgrounds available for kids to play, wild wild wet and shops selling kids clothing nearby.

Downtown East,5,"Nice place,many entertainment stuffs available...water sliding, gaming,cinemas ,KFC,mcd etc"
Downtown East,4,"For a relaxing yet interesting walkabout, loads of food options, this is it!"
Downtown East,4,"A lot changes with new F&B outlets and drinking bars. Dondonki and some beverages / zhichar establishments are fairly new too. There are two siders - E! Hub Centre and E! Avenues where the latter is more F&B establishments and Wild Wild Wet located at. The centre is more on leisure, shopping and some restaurants and bars.  However it can be better if there is a foodcourt for consumers whom are looking for lunch/dinner as casual diners."
Downtown East,4,"For a Wet Family Outing...this is THE place : Waterpark with variety of rides for tots to young n 'not so young'...fine food range from Food Court or Fast Food to Restaurants to serve U...air-conditioned shopping alley for essentials...one sentence to describe the complex :

U Ask for It - U Get It 🍀🤗☘👍! !"
Downtown East,5,We only went to Wild Wild Wet there and Starbucks after. Also saw a pop up book store. A bit of a long trip to get there though
Downtown East,5,"Downtown East
WOW very clouded today everywhere long queue, looks like there's a outdoor events... it's good to know that everybody here are healthy, cause nobody put on masks. NTUC also clouded.

Located in Pasir Ris, between Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Park. is a one-stop leisure, lifestyle and dining destination and also a choice venue to enjoy a wide range of entertainment options at affordable prices. There is a massage parlour, NTUC supermarket, cinema, laundry service, chemist , bakery, kids party supply etc

A shuttle bus is available between the mall and Pasir Ris MRT it begin at 11:00 and ends at night."
Downtown East,5,A family place with indoor water slide. Many shopping stores.
Downtown East,4,"Good place to hangout.. Tayo Station for kids is very good for them.. My son loved it.

Bowling, movies shopping wide range of opportunities."
Downtown East,5,One stop shopping... they have everything... also a lot of selection when it comes to F&B... some even with free flow ice cream and drinks
Downtown East,4,"Free parking during lunch hour the last time I visited.

Reasonable amount of food choices, DON Don Donki is a plus!"
Downtown East,4,Pretty nice place after renovation. Food is still good. But service need more improvement. The XO fried noodle and salty egg fried sweet potato is still our favourite here.
Downtown East,4,"Love love love love this place right now with its current mix of retailers.  There’s always a good variety of food although I hope that they will eventually revive the food court after it ceased operations shortly after circuit breaker.  Sad thing was that the previous NTUC food court doesn’t seemed to have any food stalls that’s enticing enough to attract customers who had probably been lured away by the small eateries at E-hub.  And the ambience within the previous food court was drab due to the dim lighting.  The Sun Paradise retailer next to wild wild wet carries a huge range of good quality swimming costumes and accessories.  Definitely worth browsing thru and buying if u require anything for water sports!! I personally owned quite a number of Arena & Sunseeker swimming suits fr this retail outlet.  There’s McDonald’s too & BHG Welcia! And more restaurants & souvenir shops, apparels shops on the second floor too. Highly recommended to visit regularly for food and toiletries as it’s a nice place with a relaxed pace since it’s positioned as a resort style of shopping mall!"
Downtown East,3,"Downtown East is one of the largest lifestyle and recreational hubs in Singapore. Its laid-back ambience, complete with resort facilities, a small bowling alley, cinema and a water park (Wild Wild Wet hailed as one of the top 10 water parks in Asia), makes for an attractive getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. Although there are a few decent eateries, there isn't any justified to be a ""die die must-try"" dining option."
Downtown East,4,Parking at MSCP is a bit of a hassle. Outdoor parking at the country club is a little far from the mall. Over a nice mall with some food options. Needs further exploration.
Downtown East,5,I'm always here with that person who made me happy...
Downtown East,4,"Downtown East has never looked better before. It has a wide array of options for shopping, dining and play and is near the Pasir Ris Beach if you ever want to build sandcastles"
Downtown East,5,"Lovely place to have fun at Wild Wild Wet, Pasir Ris Park, Stable horse pony rides, Kayaking, Cycling, Running, Camping, BBQing, Resort Chalet, Tayo Bus Indoor playground for kids if bad weather, karaoke, arcade, shopping, and lots of foodies at Level 2."
Downtown East,5,"Hmm. Love this place now. What more can u ask for. They have Mr DIY, Daiso, and most importantly they have NTUC and Redman..my favourites. Redman shop items are all placed neatly and staffs very helpful..."
Downtown East,5,"The place has numerous options for food, mainly fast food and coffee place such as Starbucks, etc. Japanese cuisine available too. However, it was a little tricky to find Wild Wild Wet as the signs are a little confusing and more than 1 type of place to collect different kinds of tickets. That might set you back a few minutes.
Overall, the place was good."
Downtown East,4,"A neighbourhood mall for people living near and in the vicinity of Pasir Ris. Mall has improved alot as compared to many years back. More small eateries. Has NTUC, Daiso and Don Don Donki! Awesome!"
Downtown East,5,"Not the best mall, but great for Small gatherings"
Downtown East,4,Odd layout but overall good selection of food and things to do
Downtown East,4,"A very big and enjoyable mall. Has an array of options for food, clothes, electronics, entertainment, and more. Its highlight is most probably the water park, which I would advice not to go to currently because of the corona virus situation. The food court here was recently closed, so cheap and accessible food options are lower compared to malls with a hawker center. However, there is no lack of restaurants, ranging from fish to fast food. The mall has multiple ktvs, bars, and a gaming cafe. Come here if u are looking for fun and some awesome food (on the medium to higher price range). There is also a big fair price on the second floor for some great grocery shopping.

Safety
It is very spacious, and so the people conform to social distancing. Very little chance of contracting the virus here, except if u go to the water park.

Why was one star dropped?
One star dropped due to the recently closed hawker center.

Good day to you"

Downtown East,5,Lots of shops. You will sure to find something to enjoy.
Downtown East,4,"Love the new revamp of downtown east. Although it can get quite confusing to get fo different parts of the malls, the food selection is good. Also, there is don don donki!!!! Maybe more directional signs would help people get around :)"

Downtown East,3,"This mall is confusing in it's layout with it's two sections. It has a ton of stores, activity and a rich history as a NTUC resort and fun activity center. It also houses the Wild wild wet water park."
Downtown East,4,"One of the most confusing shopping mall design in Singapore, the unintegrated mall.
The variety of the shops is better and the ambience is nicer."

Downtown East,5,One of the finest and classy place I'd ever visit it's superb.
Downtown East,5,Lots of choices for shopping and dining. However need familiarisation to navigate the place.

Downtown East,4,EHub and Downtown East mall with many nice restaurants!
Downtown East,5,"This is where you find Food, Entertainment, Life and People at the same place. Really enjoy spending some time there."
Downtown East,5,"Fun place to bring your kids. They definitely enjoy it. Even the adults as well. Best ride would be the torpedo, free fall and the vortex. It rained heavily but they didn't stop the activity! Nice! Acceptable queue timing for every attraction due to the number of patrons they let in because of the pandemic. However you were given limited time to be in the tsunami pool and shiok river."
Downtown East,4,lots of good food and secret hunts though it can be a little difficult to get there without driving
Downtown East,5,Downtown east is an entertainment hub and lived up to its name. It has all the amenities not only to visitors and also to the neighbours. Enjoyed my time there with my kids!

Downtown East,2,Car park too expensive.why does it charges so much by NTUC. Isnt it meant to cater for public especially for NTUC members also.

Downtown East,5,Plenty of f & b outlets. And my fav would be Daiso & Redman. A must visit😉

It is all managed by the same company, and by booking a stay at the chalet close by, you get free tickets to the waterpark if you are a “NTUC Member”. Great place for children and adults alike."

A little further there is a water park as well. What i also saw was that on weekends there is a shuttle which runs from nearest mrt to the shopping centre.
Cheap clothing outlets. Seems like a good quality time spending place."
Downtown East,4,"The place has really changed alot since I was there close to a decade ago. It seems like extensions had been added to add space to the compound.
I only came to this building (or rather wing) when I was just about to leave the premises, where I saw quite a number of eateries and restaurants. Have yet to really explore this partl though."
Downtown East,4,"To be honest, this place can be quite confusing sometimes. Downtown East, Ehub, Eavenue...

This place itself is OK, very easy to navigate and find the place you are looking for.
But the names are the ones that will confuse ppl. Especially when you are looking at the directory.

A lot of restaurants here, so a lot of food choices 👍🏽"

not enough water sprayers 6m high to keep the temperature inside the water park cool.
not enough solar panels to generate electricity in such a sunny and big place. the power generated can power the water sprayers, aircons, fans. time of this writing is nov2020. let's give it 3 years and see how."

Downtown East,4,Parking space is good. Food choices is great.
Downtown East,2,Very inconvenient location and over price chalets. Gone are the days of the old chalets as it have been demolish and new resort pattern ones are here to stay. I'm so amaze at the amount of tourist that stays here ? It's super noisy to even sleep on a weekend night that I have to call the main desk. But I would say their efficiency is 👍 The people quiet down in 5 minutes! The BBQ is so small with a tiny prep place it's miserable. With only 1 long table and 3 seats n bench it's very hard to organise any bbq with a team. Everyone basically have to stand around. 🙄
Downtown East,2,Nice place to shop and enjoy chilling out!
Downtown East,5,Great food court 😋
Downtown East,5,Muksidonna fantastic Korean tteokbokki. Keep coming back

Downtown East,2,"Some of the diaper changing room were not equipped with rubbish bins.

In the one near to Mcd, cockroaches were seen in the diaper changing room, probably because its near to the dumpster.

Downtown East,5,Good place with more entertainment and food choices
Downtown East,3,The building is badly designed. Too many drinking joint. Too many open stall along the common walkway. Shop close very early. In front of ntus fair price supermarket are always blocked by stalls and very congested. If this is a family entertainment place then it should be pack with family entertainment communities and not half dead business.

Downtown East,3,"Too crowded on Sunday, not easy to find food."
Downtown East,5,"From the early 2000s, this place had developed into a place where young lives could linger and be entertained. Here lies one of my favourite cinemas to go to after school and for dates with my ex girlfriend (now wife). Haha amazing memories with my friends too. If you are looking to shop, currently this place offers a lot of retailers."
Downtown East,4,"My colleagues n I hang out at our usual place for lunch.  Area is not too bad, cool , clean m it has a good variety of food outlets to choose from. Importantly, it is not a crowded place , so tat is really great for me as I dislike crowds  n crowded places."

Downtown East,5,"Might be a little easy to get lost but this place has food, entertainment, simple shopping. You name it."
Downtown East,3,Overall still ok but it lacks something..its just not as happening as i expect it to be. But maybe its just the Covid-19.
Downtown East,4,Good place for students to hang out as there are many things for us to do such as karaoke or swimming. A lot of good places to eat. Me and my friends frequent Anders there as its our favourite place to have lunch or dinner. There are many other food place to check out if you're interested in visiting this place.
Downtown East,5,Nice changes to the place
Downtown East,4,We went to Hi roller at Ehub level 5
Downtown East,5,"Tons of food choices to pick from , entertainment for the kids and family. Great place to head down to on the weekends"
Downtown East,5,I usually go there for indoor play ground “Toyo station”. So many food options are there.

Downtown East,3,This place is good for family outing.
Downtown East,5,Calm life with ample of space to walk and relax yourself....
Downtown East,5,Got all the good food in place with ntuc discount...
Downtown East,5,Rides are maintained well. Just recently went back after it initially opened so can see that they are not slacking. A good place for anyone from 3 to the golden years to have a bit of fun or just to relax.
Downtown East,4,"Children friendly,but please put more chairs on the side,so that preggy lady,old lady,fathers with a little active kids could sit at the side ways .thank you"
Downtown East,5,"A place with a wide variety of activities and food options, accessibility is slightly less convenient as it is some distance from the nearest station"
Downtown East,3,"Good varieties of dining options.
But with the integration of EHub and the resort expansion, navigating around this mall can be challenging."
Downtown East,5,Nice ambience... Limited varieties....
Downtown East,5,"I recommend the Siam square mookata! Damage per person is about $30. U can either choose ala carte or buffet. And most importantly, it opens til 6am in the morning! Great place for ppl who craves for mookata in the middle of the night! Great food and great service! They have another outlet at punggol settlement too but it's closed til 29th sep."
Downtown East,4,"Good and easy access since it is in the neighbourhood. It is upgrading some parts which is good. Parking fees is lower than White Sands shopping mall which is an attractive feature if you are looking for a place to sip your coffee, see a movie or just buying groceries 😀"
Downtown East,4,Would say that I haven't been there for a few years. The development at Downtown East is surprising. The Chalets looked really comfortable and the mall has everything you would need especially if you are bringing children
Downtown East,5,"All in one integrated resort? For locals, family friendly and for all ages. I must say it's the best NTUC co-op has built. Wait is there another?"
Downtown East,5,"Amusement place such as the wild wild wet  and chalets are a stones' throw away from the cinema and eateries. Many good places to eat.. With varying budget that you have, you can have a decent meal. NTUC supermarket is there and there is a two storey indoor place for kids to have a good 1 hr playtime."
Downtown East,3,Be prepared for long queues even for slow river
Downtown East,4,Nice shopping mall with a movie theatre which since the revamp is part of the recent transformation of Pasir Ris.

Downtown East,5,"Great place for shopping, lots of restaurant, cinema. Kids friendly place."
Downtown East,5,It's at downtown east
Downtown East,5,Everything under 1 roof. Great fun.
Downtown East,5,"Recently upgraded with shopping, water playground resort, supermarket, entertaintment and F&B..All in one hub waiting for your visit. Near to White Sand MRT."
Downtown East,4,It is convenient and sheltered directly to the MRT. However COVID 19 measures has led to one single entrance to enter which makes the experience of accessibility rather not as great. Tim Ho Wan would be one of the highlights in the shopping mall.
Downtown East,5,"You can do groceries, have your meals, do the Daiso, buy hardware n home stuff at Mr DIY and best of all don't have to worry about parking time for the time being."
Downtown East,2,Big space but not fully utilise. Should make more kids play and have more shops. Such as Value shop. So that people going to chalet and beach can easily make last minute purchase.
Downtown East,5,It was SUPER FUN!
Downtown East,5,"Came here for Wild Wild Wet and was hungry, but it lacks good food options."
Downtown East,5,Great foos choices and lots of variety

As with all attractions, can get crowded so plan your visit."
Downtown East,5,Mr DIY AND DIASO IS HERE
Downtown East,5,"Roomy mall, next to the Wild Wild Wet and the relaxing D'Resort which is currently out of reach."
Downtown East,4,"Can't really call this a shopping mall despite the multiple shops here. The place has a rather chilled feel, which makes you rather window shop then do actual serious shopping.

Good weekend hangout location."
Downtown East,5,Nice place to spend with your loved ones on a weekend
Downtown East,5,"Lot of eateries mostly halal. Ideal for family get together. Also has super market, bakeries, fast food, etc."

Downtown East,5,Got two of my favorite shops together.. Mr DIY and. Daiso.. and  Fairprice too..
Downtown East,4,"Slightly inconvenient place if taking public transport, may need to change buses more than once to reach just the outside of the resort.

A few shops at the front and the very obvious water theme park. The shops are the typical brands popular in local malls, nothing much to see. Haven't been to the water park so nothing to review yet, but it seems promising from the outside.

As for the chalet, it is right by the sea side, which means a decent amount of walking is required. I think there is a buggy shuttle between the mall and the chalet section, did not have the chance to ride it as it was after 8pm when I left.

There is only 1 electronic gate to the park and seaside from the chalet. I wanted to go to the park but I would not be able to get back in as the gate requires the chalet key card. Which I did not have as I was invited as a guest.

The chalet rooms seems to be well maintained, can't review anymore as I was not staying over night and did not manage to get a closer look."
Downtown East,4,"Great food, affordable prices. Seems to be very popular with students."
Downtown East,5,I love to go there because not very crowded.
Downtown East,4,Great place for family and friends to visit.

Downtown East,4,Good mix of shops. Good food
Downtown East,5,Ramen at affordable prices.. 😊
Downtown East,4,Don Don Donki is here!
Downtown East,5,"After a huge renovation, there are a lot more things here. Very exciting to see. Did not know of this renovation until my children told me."
Downtown East,4,The arcade here is very fun! Alot of variety. With $20 you can spend the at least 2 - 3 hours here + gift! I love the arcade here.
Downtown East,5,"A very beautiful scenery to behold.
The place is full of life.
The environment is so green and fresh.
Accessible to malls,

Downtown East,4,Super good and modern place filled with many different facilites!
Downtown East,5,The best shopping mall
Downtown East,5,Came here for the ramlee burger..

Downtown East,4,"This is place for those like swimming and other water activities. Wild wild wet @ downtown east. Fast food restaurants and varieties of asian food will provide good feast for hungry visitor after water activities. For those wanna getaway with their family, its one of the fun place."
Downtown East,5,I visited pasta mania there. It was a takeaway order and they served up quite fast. The restaurant is pretty quiet and good for catching up or lunch meetings. Was a warm day tho. Perhaps the weather had seeped into the restaurant making it slightly less cool then usual.
Downtown East,5,Great place for leisure time.
Downtown East,4,Great place for schoolkids and teenages.
Downtown East,5,"Love this place as there are a great choice of eateries. We came here many times during our visit to Spore this time with several different people! Sadly, we are back in the UK now & missing all especially the Bubble Tea there"

Downtown East,5,Great place.
Downtown East,4,"Big water park but it's really out of the way. Walkable distance from Pasir Ris station but it's really at the end of the world. You either live near or have to make a trip just for this. There are a surprising number of shops to be found in there, but no idea who will do their shopping there especially with White Sand shopping mall in the vacinity."
Downtown East,4,"Great for family outings. Wide ranch of food, cinema and activity for kids. Resort stay is just a stone throw away. Suitable for tourists too."
Downtown East,3,Love the Thai food there. There is Aston too. Love giving my son a train ride too. Mookata was cheap but not as great as the one at golden mile.
Downtown East,5,It was nice. I had MacDonald's. Very clean.
Downtown East,5,"This place it’s really one of a kind really unique compared to other malls.

Wild wild wet is here and there are resorts nearby.

Downtown East,4,"Nice water park which was recently expanded and renovated in the past few years. However, maintenance of the park could be better, such as those shower cubicles and flooring around the park. Also, there seems to be limited shelters from one attraction to another, and the walk could be quite Long as there are many bare spots around the newer area."
Downtown East,4,Great place to shop and eat.. a variety of halal food options..

Downtown East,4,"I remember how Downtown East used to look before its makeover. It looks so much better with a modern design. It is even better connected to E!hub now.

Especially with the expansion of the Wild Wild Wet water park, there's so much to explore here at Downtown East! It's had a wonderful improvement now"
Downtown East,4,"Many amenities and a variety of shops for patrons. Great choices of food to choose from, and WildWildWet is right there for family fun"
Downtown East,2,"It was a nice place by the past, full of life and definitely one of these places to go. Successive renovations have broken the charm and I will no more advise anybody to go there.

Downtown East,5,This place has been overhaul. Very nice and pleasant place. You should come over for a walk when you are sick of the same old shopping mall set up.

Downtown East,3,This place is bit  Dark on the 2nd 3rd floor
Downtown East,4,Many choices for food and the wild wild wet  was fun.  Ideal place for family bonding

Downtown East,1,Recently a lot of Vegetables that I bought from fairprice spoil within a week! Before that I can keep longer than a week. Terrible. Last month also bought 4 avocados all spoiled! What the hell.
Downtown East,5,Good many options here sells Chinese things well duh
Downtown East,4,"This place is a mixed bag but has certain facilities that you cant get elsewhere in the East. For example, Wild Wild Wet is a one of its kind water theme park in Singapore, there is an indoor playground for kids, a number of pretty good restaurants, a few enrichment centres for kids. The place is probably one more highlight away from being a very happening place."
Downtown East,4,"With the new upgrade, lots of varieties to eat and shop. Great place to hang out."

Downtown East,4,"The whole Downtown East has revamped. There are lots of shops and restaurants here. We enjoyed the food in Ice Edge Bar, the manager and staff are very friendly too.you can come during weekdays,  besides special lunch menu, they even have Happy Hour!! Besides we tried D'Bar food too .Their Stewed Pork Belly &  Beef Cheek are superb and melts in your mouth!! If you like Thai food, Basil Inn is pretty authentic, the only thing is ..portions are pretty small. Yes, Aston here always long queue during weekends. If you want to eat steaks, try not to go on weekends, or you have to go early to bit the queue. Pasta Mania is for those who just want a quick bite, do try their Tom Yam pasta and honey chicken.  My all time favourite."

Downtown East,4,Try parking at level 2 or 3 for easy access to restaurants and the linkbridge.
Downtown East,4,Better to park at level 2 or level 3 of the carpark as that's where most of the restaurants and shops are located. Tayo station is at level 3 and it's a great place for younger kids as it's not too overwhelming for them.

Downtown East,4,"Recommended for family trips as Wild Wild Wet is just right beside the mall. Threppy by Daiso is also a good place to visit as you might find items that you may not see at other Daiso. But, be prepared for the higher prices as items in Threppy by Daiso can reach upwards of $20. Mr D.I.Y. is also a good place to visit as you might find household items that you may need. National Trade Union Co-operative Fair price is also a good place to visit as you would definitely not be hit by the markups like for example, inside Wild Wild Wet."

Downtown East,4,After e revamp still nothing much but definitely better than e last time😅

Bedok Reservoir Park,4,Beautiful and breezy place.
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Beautiful scenery with a reservoir, you may even be able to catch the most stunning sunset. Great place to jog, but the sand may go into your shoes, which is quite uncomfortable. Also, there is no shade excepy for the canopies of trees, so if you are caught in a rain then you may be drenched. Overall a wonderful place."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,Nice place for walk and jog 👌
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,Beautiful place .
Bedok Reservoir Park,4,"Made made and converted from a former sand quarry in the 1980s, Bedok Reservoir is a recreational park that is accessible within the Bedok residential enclave. While not comparable to our other larger reservoirs like MacRitchie which is within located within a forest, it is more easily accessible and close to hawker centres, shops and cafes.

A waterfront-themed clubhouse is being constructed with facilities like an indoor water-adventure area, an infinity pool, and a members-only lounge for NS Men."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Great open space, not busy at all! Cyclist, runners or general walkers would all love this area!"
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Park on the reservoir, beautiful place, good for exercise, or just for sitting and relax to see the sunrise or sunset. Love this place, many turtles and fish inside the lake"
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"For similar activities that one enjoys at beaches like cycling, strolling along views of the water and exercising, this place is a great alternate option to the beach. What I like most is that you can pick your own (fairly) private spot anywhere to contemplate away from crowds anytime of the day. And if the timing is right, you get to hear the birds sing."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Is better to go on evening then other time of the day, much cooler than any time of the day,but try not to go after 7pm is lesser people there, therefore it is not safe 😛."

Good jogging trail (although did not see many people at around 4pm++ weekday timing, also after a short rain). It does not offer F&B and ready sport equipment station; nearby HDB shophouses can serve one's needs of refreshment after activities there though. I understand that the reservoir also allows some watersport activities."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Good view. Good place to jog , walk & relax in the morning or evening. Approximately 30min walk to go around the reservoir. Some water or climbing activities during weekends. Fishing area also allocated in the area. Restroom & drinking vending machines located nearby Kayaking storage. A favourite place for nearby residents. Safe to walk at night."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"One of the important reservoirs of Singapore. Gravel jogging track that goes round the reservoir. About 6km for one round the reservoir. Scenic view and there are students doing canoes training. There also an adventure park, cycling / jogging track and a bistro for dining. Sadly this place has many histories of suicide by drowning at the reservoirs so kind spooky and yet peaceful and quiet at the same time."
Bedok Reservoir Park,4,👍
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Nice place to have evening walk, jog or cycle here. There are two paths, tar road and sand road. Sand road would be longer due to curve but more wider and lesser people chosen this way. Tar road more proper but more crowded.

This place is also accessible by bus from Bedok, Tampines and even close to Bedok Reservoir mrt."

Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"My evenings are better because of this verdant space. A park that never feels crowded despite a constant stream of walkers and joggers with the occasional cyclist and roller-blader. There are two paying car parks that are rarely full because locals walk there.

The public toilet near Car Park B (entry from Tampines Ave 10) is under renovation between Sep 2018 to the end of the year. Some portable toilets have been installed across from it. The drinking fountain around the same spot appears to be still functioning."
Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Bedok Reservoir had something for everyone. Whether you are a running buff, yoga lover, nature enthusiast or you just want to go for a long walk with your loved ones, this place will never disappoint you. It is easily accessible by public transport or Uber. Perfect place for jogging and exercising. At one corner there is board walk where you can just relax or do meditation.

Bedok Reservoir Park,5,"Bedok Reservoir is basically a great stress reliever place for a good stroll or jog after a stressful day getting f×××ed by your boss or infinite nag by your wife. This is also an ideal place for couples who run out of cash to go for a proper date night and can spend a romantic night here with some French kissing without public knowing as it can be quite dark at night. But do take note not to go overboard as there are rangers patrolling the area with a very bright torch light in search of illegal activities like fishing at illegal spots, releasing fishing nets into the water, polluting the water and couples behaving badly"

Bedok Reservoir Park,4,"(Translated by Google) 17-06-2019 Walk slowly along the lake for about an hour, about 5km. The temperature is high during the day and will be directly exposed to the sun along the lake. There are parks, public toilets, children's play areas by the lake. You can also do rafting activities and climbing activities. There are road trees on both sides but they are directly sun-lit, so you will be sun-protected if you are afraid of the sun.

(Original)
17-06-2019 沿着湖畔一圈慢慢走约一个小时，大约有5km。白天温度较高，沿着湖畔会直接晒到太阳。湖边有公园，公厕，儿童游乐区，也可以做泛舟活动和攀爬活动，随然两旁都有路树但是属于太阳直照，所以怕晒的误必做好防晒啦❤"

What is good is that around the lake, throughout the pacours, there are toilets and water at each kilometer.

Très bel endroit avec un grand lac (qui sert de reservoir d'eau) au milieu entouré par des arbres. Lieu idéal pour la promenade en famille, la pratique du running, les canoas et il y a aussi un endroit pour les mordus des circuits au sommet des arbres.

Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Looks like a favourite place among cyclists. Serene scenery for a nice walk too.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Great destination for a short outing not far away! One of the last places where u can see natural wetlands in Punggol before development encroaches!
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Nice place to walk around especially in early morning
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,Peaceful and lovely view someone in urbanised Singapore for residents to enjoy and exercise!
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,It can lead to pasir ris farmway pcn at the side but the park here nothing much but to see its pond view.  Not a place to run except you run on the pcn pathway.
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,"A relatively unknown place where you can spot snakeheads, turtles and other pond-dwellers in their natural habitat. I like how serene it is. More can probably be done to further develop the place, right now it doesnt feel like theres a lot to do there."
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,"Nice, quiet. Toilets and water cooler available  👍"
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,"Walking Area,nice view.."
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,"quiet and relax on weekday,not sure on weekend..."
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,Nice environment
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,"Nice views, quiet place."
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Always a great place to walk and do wildlife photography
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Nice place to run but quite crowded.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Birding hotspot. No proper parking nearby.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,"Beautiful, serene, peaceful..could spend the whole day looking at nature here, if it weren't for the hot sun"
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,The serenity and  beauty of the place makes it hard to imagine that till about twenty years ago this was a waste landfill.
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,Nice place to walk alone...
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Out of the way park.  Worth a visit
Lorong Halus Wetland,4,A welcome respite from the highly urbanised areas of Singapore. Can be hot in the daytime. Dress down and enjoy the nature.
Lorong Halus Wetland,3,Nice ponds and bird watcher regular.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,I'll always pass by this place whenever I'm going to punggol from pasir ris by running or skating. Has a really calming feel and it's so pretty at dusk and Dawn.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Very relaxing place to visit either day or night. Quite humid sometimes tho!
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,At night abit eerie.
Lorong Halus Wetland,5,Great Place !!

Singapore River Cruise,4,Journey on the river by the quiet electric boat is relaxing. Bit sunny during the day tour but the breeze gives you company. You get to see iconic places of Singapore during the tour. Queue up front to get open deck seats and enjoy 45 minutes journey.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Booked a night trip using my Singapore Rediscover vouchers.
Night is cooling and view is amazing. Managed to also learn more about the history of Singapore during this night cruise.
Do queue early if you would like to sit in the open where photo ops are better"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"The best attractive for the tourist who comes to Singapore. As it covers major attractions of Singapore while you enjoy the boat ride across the Singapore river like Merlion, MBS, Esplanade... Its location is right Opp. to Clarke where you also have lot of easteries which includes Cafes, Restaurant, Pub,..."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"This was the most amazing and memorable part of our Singapore trip...the river cruise.
It start at the Clark Quay and takes you all the way to the Merlion, the Marina Bay and back. In addition to these two attractions it also gives you a peek through of the corporate world in Singapore... The tall skycrapering corporate buildings and to contradict them there are vividly multi colored smaller buildings on the river bay which add beauty to the area and are simply breathtaking.
The cruise includes a telebot narrator who asks the cruise progresses narrates the history of the surrounding area. The cruise is typically called the BUM BOATS... they are in eye catching red and green color with a big set of eyes...!!! It also has a covered seated area (in case it rains during the cruise tour) as well as a open deck (which allows you a 360 degree view and capture the most of the surrounding on the river tour)...!
Enjoy your bum boat ride with family and friends!!!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Fantastic cruise on the Singapore.We have done it during the day, but it is best by night, all boats are now electric and very very quiet. The best time is late evening. Take the tickets in advance as the queue can be quite long even during off peak hours."
Singapore River Cruise,5,5 Stars ! Use my Rediscover Vouchers and it was well worth it ! The whole journey 2-way took about 40 minutes. We book a night slot recently at December 2020. Night scenery was AMAZING... Cooling night too....
Singapore River Cruise,5,Chose the 9pm slot and had the whole boat for $20. sibeh worth
Singapore River Cruise,5,Liked the fact that all boats are now electric and very very quiet. The best time is late evening. Take the tickets in advance as the queue is quite long even during off peak hours. Lots of tour operators come here and there are suddenly 30 people in front of you.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Stunning view can be seen around.
City lights"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice cruise in Singapore. It’s worthy taking this cruise. Very friendly staff to introduce Singapore river buildings and history!
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Dont miss it. There are charge quay, boat quay and bay area connected with fabulous views.

Suggested for night view"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Short but sweet.  Nice cruise around the harbor.  Very nice crew!
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Great experience and thankfully the weather was clear. We took a Night cruise, at around 7:35pm. Perfect timing to get to see the colorful fountain @Marina Bay Sands. Beautiful and spectacular view."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Had a good time floating on the waterways. The comentary was not too irritating. The boats are clean and silent.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Best way to see night beauty of Singapore. There are several quays along Singapore river. However, I used Clarke Quay to start the journey and got down near Merlion. If you go during night time, there is a high chance of seeing the light show infront of Marina Bay Sands. Video was played ona TV inside the boat explaining places the boat pass by."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"We did both the Afternoon and evening experience, and they both were fantastic!!!! Highly recommended during your time in Singapore."
Singapore River Cruise,5,The river cruise was great. We went at nighttime and took the cruise from Clarke Quay. The ticket process was easy and we didn't have to wait long at all. The cruise was informative and super relaxing after a hot day. We also got treated to fireworks during the cruise due to Chinese New Year. Would definitely recommend taking the cruise at night. The river is gorgeous all lit up. The boats for the cruise are also all electric which is cool.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Singapore River pride. Plenty to do and more to see and eat around. Very safe environment for kids too. There is not enough playground though. I see only this one.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Great if you are cruising during evening on weekends you get to see Singapore from the River side. You will witness spectacular Lazer light show, fountain and music on marine Bay . May not be worth the day and regular day cruising"
Singapore River Cruise,4,An easy way to tour around Singapore. The recorded over voice is very informative.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"The cruise starts at Clarke Quay, makes a loop near the Esplanade at Marina Bay, and goes back to Clarke Quay. You may start at either jetty and end at the same jetty. The 60-minute cruise includes the 40-minute route. But it goes farther up-river to Robertson Quay and covers newer sections on the River."
Singapore River Cruise,1,"It's mainly just a way to transport yourself from the Art Science Museum to the further end of Clarke Quay or vice versa.

The bay area is psychedelic at night and is great for pictures but the cost of the boat ride is too high and the ride is too short."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Thank you of your very good service. All my friends are very happy.
Hope have the opportunity to meet again"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"""Singapore River Cruise""

Excellent attraction. Lovely cruise around the river providing priceless views of Clarke Quay and Marina Bay Sands.

#SingaporeRiverCruise #RiverCruise #jishu"
Singapore River Cruise,4,We enjoyed the cruise very much. As we started at 5 30pm the ambience was great. One should have at least one cruise when at Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,5,"It's a beautiful and very peaceful place to roam.
Novotel is present"
Singapore River Cruise,4,Nice river tour to acquaint yourself with the city
Singapore River Cruise,5,Good for a tour. Beautiful city view.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Saturday night cruise with my Beautiful Dar.
Awesome scenery .
Check it out"
Singapore River Cruise,5,I was there in friday night. Have experienced what singapore TGIF looked like in the outside. It was so much fun. Of cuz it is expensive. Foods r delicious though ☻
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice location for photography and great experience with boat trip. Looking around Singapore. Superb experience.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Looking for a Night Life? Drinks? Or looking for a buddy? Maybe this would good for you, lots of bar, restaurant, views, which you can enjoy.. You can ride a boat for a couple of bucks.."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Went for the 7pm timeslot, able to see day and night view and managed to capture many nice pictures. Thanks Singapore for the tourism voucher. :)"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Wanna see the Singapore things? You'll see the Singapore things!
Singapore River Cruise,5,Very pleasant river interlude. Informative commentary which couldn't be heard from the rear open deck. Many excellent photo opportunities. Extremely good 40 minute cruise.
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Great way of seeing the city from the water, particularly on an evening cruise which also takes in the laser light show. The evening cruise is an hour plus they talk you through the sights along the river!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Clarke Quay reminded me a lot of Sydney's number one tourist trap, Darling Harbour. I wasn't expecting a lot from the SGD25.00 river cruise beyond overcrowding, a quick dash around the waterways and cheesy pre-recorded commentary.

But it was bloody fabulous and tremendous value for money.

The boat departed at under 50% capacity so there was plenty of space to roam about to get the best views. And the cruise went for more than half an hour, the leisurely pace making it great for snapping pix even with a mobile phone.

Oh - I *was* right about the terrible pre-recorded commentary, however. 😆"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Awesome experience! Loved the explanation about Singapore.
Scenic ride and highly recommended."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Beautiful place for evening outing.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Cool river, cleaner roadside, commercial background.."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Singapore River Cruise is delight for eyes , if one want to experience meaning of Happening and cheerful then it should visit Singapore river cruise ."
Singapore River Cruise,5,They take you all through the city with spectacular views and give you a wonderful history of the city
Singapore River Cruise,4,Nice stroll in the evening with plenty of street food around.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Very good night scene . So many food and beer shops near pier of river boat.  25  S$/ person for boat riding and need to take about one hour.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Good place for hang out
Singapore River Cruise,5,"It's really worth it to catch the river cruise along the Singapore River. You will have the best photo opportunities for the iconic Merlion, Marina Bay Sands and the CBD towers."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Excellent cruise.Got an opportunity to see Clarke Quay, Marina Bay Sands and nearby surrounds on a boat with a friendly driver."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Great Singapore attraction! Must try.

Take the route called as ""The tale of 2 Quays (40mins)"". The ticket cost at the counter is $25 per adult while $15 per child. The boat takes you to Marina Bay for a spectacular view of Singapore CBD and brings you back to the same place where you boarded the boat. Best time to board is around 6-7pm as you can enjoy both the day and night scenes.

Highlights: Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Marina Bay

The last trip is at 10:30 pm."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Pleasant, friendly, worth it!!!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Perfect way to see the Singapore downtown water quickly!
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Good way to learn more about Singapore culture. Cruise is okay but bad customer services by the counter. We board by the Merlion, sales person were rude and told us to wait for 15 minutes, we waited 40 minutes."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Brings you around different parts of sg (in town) and speaks about the history as well
Singapore River Cruise,2,"Called them twice wanted to check if can board at Esplanade for the river cruise.
Nobody listen. Proceeded to Esplanade and found their kiosks closed. Went to Clark Quay and boarded. No notifications at their website. Bad!!!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Well maintained boat with polished wood finish.  Prefer outdoor seating.  They give recorded description of places around and that helps.  We took the ride at 6 pm so weather was nice.  Good for views and photographs.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Fresh air and fantastic night view!
Singapore River Cruise,5,A must visit icon
Singapore River Cruise,5,It's a must try if you want to see the Singapore with a different angle this cruise is not very lavish or have dinner or something in it's just a tourist attraction to see the architecture & heritage buildings of Singapore..
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great ride with a unique view of Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,5,entire singapore in 1 hr.  must get in
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Took my friends and family, highly suggest to save this until the night time. Worth spending the extra money to watch the marina bay sands light show from the water. Have dinner at Clarke quay and then jump on the river cruise."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Smooth and comfortable boat ride. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Had lots of fun. Night time is best
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great views of around bay are and good views of marina bay
Singapore River Cruise,1,"Joined laser show river cruise and regret... shouldn't include laser show wasting time and money. For laser show should just view at alongside Fullerton Hotel rather than spend money for cruise to and can't enjoy ... worse part is fountain show at Marina Sand total can't see at all at cruise should go to LV alongside and enjoy the show.
So... don't waste your money and time if you wanna enjoy the laser & fountain show on river cruise organise by Water B."
Singapore River Cruise,5,One of the romantic things to do in Singapore at night. Great way to see the river scene in Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Calm and Serene place, quiet and non polluting boats, good experience. With jumbo eating place nearby, it was a treat after a long day."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Was a really great experience to see Singapore from the water side.
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Electric Silence
It was a nice experience to see some Singapore sights from water level, supported by an explanation on a TV in the cabin. But take into account: 1) Boats can be sold out, therefore be ready to wait for quite a while; 2) Boats can be crowded and if you don't have a seat at the window, you won't see much; 3) They don't accept credit/debit cards."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"The cruise is nice, the organisation upfront a little unfriendly, but ride is nice, the boats are in good shape and they are powered electric so no noise and bad smell, over all nice, better after sunset."
Singapore River Cruise,1,"It's a well planned attraction but run by very rude and unprofessional staff. I arrived a few minutes before 7 and saw the boatman walk towards the boat. Asked the reception if I can still get the ferry.

Well the guy raised his voice and told me ""Who are you? Even the prime minister also cannot stop the boat.""

""No way to talk to the boat driver now."" And proceeds to communicate w the boat driver.

You can be crude. But you would not be a good fit for the service line. Don't let your colleagues look bad."
Singapore River Cruise,3,Enjoyed the ride but too expensive for what you get
Singapore River Cruise,5,It is a worth experience :)
Singapore River Cruise,5,Wonderful experience 😍
Singapore River Cruise,4,"If you don't want to walk, can take River Cruise. 40mins trip."
Singapore River Cruise,5,We went to the safari with our two boys and enjoyed every moment of it. Very educational. As per my little one the BEST part was the panda 🐼
Singapore River Cruise,3,Purely touristy
Singapore River Cruise,5,Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Not as spectacular as I had anticipated. But got some good shots. Crew and staff had the attitude that they had done it 5000 times before, which they had. But always feels better if crew are welcoming, and as one of the staff at a tourist destination once said to me ""Thank you for coming because if you were not here, then I would not be here either"". True!!"
Singapore River Cruise,3,"The round-trip is limited to Marina Bay and Downtown. In my opinion 25 SGD are quite a lot. However, the boots are beautiful."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Good boat ride if you take the 7:30PM slot. You will be able to see the lights show at the Marina Bay Sands from the river, it gives a great view. 25$ however is pretty expensive."
Singapore River Cruise,5,There is no better way to appreciate the spirit of this city and its architectural gems than a nightly boat cruise. Good narrative via speaker. Recommended.
Singapore River Cruise,5,This ride is so peaceful. The view was amazing. One can enjoy the view and click many photos
Singapore River Cruise,5,A very good way to explore Singapore's skylines. The light show is amazing
Singapore River Cruise,4,"A wonderful boat ride tour  in the river of Singapore where you get to see most of the prime locations of Singapore. This boat ride is simply superb during the night time due to the lighting of the structure all around like Clarke Quay, Marina Bay, Corporate Buildings etc. The charges for this ride are nominal and you will definitely feel great after this. This is a must to go for if you are visiting Singapore for any sight seeing purpose."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Great river trip, no information given but allows one the ability to get an understanding of the city."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Great vistas and a very nice time. Try to catch the 19:30 one, so you see the lights during the blue hour. Also try to get a seat in the open space at the back of the boat, much nicer if it doesn't rain."
Singapore River Cruise,4,You can buy tickets online or at kiosk where the boats leave. The cruise itself is not very long and boats are not too small and not too big. They give a commentary in English of all the landmarks. It's an interesting experience to add to the Singapore vacation.
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Quite expensive at $25 each, but gives you a great overview of the city, especially helpful if you take a cruise on your first day here! At night with the city lights is probably the best time, and if you time your journey right you can have a view of the water & light display in front of Marina Bay Sands!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Well planned cruise with good views of Clarke Quay.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"One of the most enjoyable & interesting entertainment we had in our last vacation trip to Singapore, February 2016 was the Evening Singapore River Cruise. A unique experience to see Singapore at night while riding a boat down the Singapore River. Highly recommendable."
Singapore River Cruise,1,"This River Cruise Company is not very good organized.. the lady will only accept cash, no cards. She can not inform you about departure time of the boat, can be 40 minutes can be 1,5 hour... she is very not interested in her job. You better take the company WaterB on the opposite site of the river, very friendly, well organized and accept cards.."
Singapore River Cruise,1,"The cruise starts on the Singapore River, under some bridges to the bay. You see more of the same sight walking alone the river at your own pace. The “laser show” cruise, which is S$38, is definitely not worth it. The boat stops behind the display and you miss all the amazing laser show that is projected on the water spray. You can easily (and free) get a better view from the boardwalk on Marina Bay Sands."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"It was super interesting to catch the river animals through this up-close exhibitions...i especially enjoyed the water rides where the boat host explains about the different wild-life birds that frequent this location...it felt surreal especially in Singapore where we are surrounded mostly by buildings, this place lets you take a step back and enjoy...do wait for the promotion season where you can visit either zoo and river safari in order to make your trip worthwhile :)"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"What a fab place for an evening stroll/food/entertainment/river cruise with full commentary and history($25). All kinds of Asian food Indian Thai Chinese etc, live music (although this can be a little overpowering as it’s door to door). Plenty to see and do. A must for the visitors."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Very nice place at the river side. Didn't go on the cruise
Singapore River Cruise,5,I recommend you to go after the sunset.. its amazing with all the lights
Singapore River Cruise,1,"Ask how long exactly you have to wait. The people in the ticket office are not on top of things, and rather on their phone then giving good information to the customer."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Nice tour for the night time. Everything looks nice in night lights.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Amazing experiences. We tried day and night river cruise to get different sensation.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Cruise was lovely.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Great view down Singapore River! Would recommend first-timers to book the cruise for the lighting show at MBS. Service was punctual and overall pleasant.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Best at night. Nice cruise. Good commentary on a TV with video. Definitely recommend this.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"A tourist friendly boat ride lasting for about 40 minutes or so, it is the best way to get a glimpse of architecture in Singapore,  the history of the place in an eco friendly transport.  The tour has a recorded commentary.  If you choose to take a twilight cruise, you can see the lighting as the night falls and follow up with a dinner on Clarke Quay. An enjoyable experience"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Loved this tour. The bumboats took us through the historic waterways of the city explaining the growth and changes the city has gone through in years. It's a very good initiative for everyone who would not only look for visiting Singapore but also knowing the city well. I took the night cruise from Clark quay, I did an on-spot reservation but you could book earlier. The lights, the city, the boat ride, with a story being told on the way is what you'll need for a good evening stroll."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Go after the sunset, see the wonderful colours of the Singapore skyline"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"The staff is really good and courteous. The evening cruise takes you through the ckark quay and surrounding areas. It is a very relaxing ride with soothing live music. Click pictures, sit and relax. Enjoy the ride."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Pleasant criuse at night
Singapore River Cruise,5,Really enjoy the whole boat ride!
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice cruise if you do it in the evening. Nice lighting. Must try
Singapore River Cruise,5,Cool city with major developments since last visit.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great rundtrip if you will see Singapore from the Water sight.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"We visited there , night is very active and beautiful.  Memorial time with friends"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Cruise was awesome and the audio on the boat was great to listen to. Light show really recommended!
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great experience ......watch the tallest buildings and going around in midst of city by a cruise is real nice.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Enjoyed it a lot. Took the 7.30pm cruise so we could watch the laser light show. It was a wonderful experience.
Singapore River Cruise,1,Went to the Ticketing Counter to ask for more info on 5th Oct 2019. This lady staff ignored me and busy with her things. I'd to called her few times before she served me! At first I thought she's really DEAF! What a rude service! Spoilt my mood. Thought to bring my family of 5 for a tour... Unbelievable with this kind of services at Singapore River Cruise...
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Great cruise, well worth money paid"
Singapore River Cruise,5,It was the most memorable evening... Great view and etched in our memories firever... 😍
Singapore River Cruise,5,"The river cruise on Keelang river is a great experience. The boat slowly cruises along, allowing g you to soak the sights at leisure. Clark quay, Merlion, the bridges, parliament building and so many more. The sharp contrast between the glass and steel towers with the two story heritage houses with red tiles is an amazing sight. The boat cruise is well worth the time and 35 $. Try the hyperlapse to capture the boat ride. I have posted some videos which can be seen to have a glimpse of what to expect."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Best place to relax and see Singapore river front
Singapore River Cruise,4,Goood cruise to take during evening time. Commentary of the places is also good.
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Booked Singapore River Cruise through klook.

This is a fun experience. But Very short ride, still its fun and nice with commentary of the places. I suggest take the one with the light show at marina bay. The light show is absolutely worth it. Hoever, you could even just walk to marina bay and watch it, its free for public."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Friendly service, warm welcome for being Indian. Memorable experience. 😊"
Singapore River Cruise,5,The night time river cruise is great. Not recommended before sunset as it is tooooo hot. The night one has fantastic light alone the river and when you come to Marina Bay Sands there is a light music show at or maybe around 8pm (sorry but I cannot remember the exact time you may check the website). You can see and enjoy almost all the big things alone the bay. Highly recommended the night one. There would be an audio guider on the boat so you can.get some knowledge if you have little idea about Singapore river and its history. Enjoy.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice ride
Singapore River Cruise,5,It's so awesome to see white merlion
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great 40 min trip down to Marina Bay & back to Clark Quay. Don't miss it. Easy access from Park Regis Hotel.   Y
Singapore River Cruise,5,Grate activity for tourists coming to Singapore.  River cruise take you around the city in a river way by which you may have glimpses of Singapore including skyscrapers on the river bank. The boatman through his commentary explains how the Singapore grew over the years. Rates of river cruise are little higher than expected.
Singapore River Cruise,3,"$25 for a river cruise is not worth it to be honest. Yes the views were nice and there were some explanations and stuffs, but the ride was quite bumpy, there was some sort of smell the moment we sat down and the staff sort of had an attitude problem as if he woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day.... if you dont like your job... just quit..."
Singapore River Cruise,5,It’s awesome. Enjoying boating with nice Singapore view and enjoyed beautiful evening with colourful lights...
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice experience. We can able to see beautiful city from cruise.
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Good for tourists, check weather before purchasing tickets"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Nice ride, great views!"
Singapore River Cruise,4,"25SGD per person for about 30min. ride around Marina Bay and Merlion Park. If you want to make good pictures, for sure sit in back of the boat, not inside. The boats are not new, but maintained well enough. Staff are not much talkative, the guide is speaking from audio.
If you want to quickly see, what is around and do not want to walk, recommend this tour."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"I brought my friends and relatives from abroad to take this boat, and they liked it.
The best time to take this is at night, where there are lots of lights, we cannot see the original color of the water :P , and we can see most of the popular attractions in Singapore, such as Merlion, MBS, Flyers, etc.
There was one time we took this boat and the lady played a musical instrument (so that added to the atmosphere), but at another time there was no entertainment at all on the boat."
Singapore River Cruise,1,Singapore River Cruise is currently closed. We went today(2nd Aug2020) and there was not a single boat in sight. We had to get out tickets canceled and money refunded. Please double check before booking ticket.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Better come at night for a good breeze
Singapore River Cruise,4,We can see the beautiful river front view along with the Singapore history through video.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Mesmerising boat ride. When you come across beautiful sceneries, tall buildings, evening boat ride is a feast to watch. Merlion, marina bay and many more."
Singapore River Cruise,2,The tour itself is good and interesting! However the personal when you go buy tickets the woman who serves you is terrible and rude. I do recomend it to get to know the history. Just be prepare for some bad communucstion.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Nice, must-have trip in Singapore!"
Singapore River Cruise,4,Do it in the night time . The sky line is beautiful
Singapore River Cruise,1,Two of them said were on a break for 1 hour and they wont sell a ticket until they are off break at Clarke quay. But i could find another stop that would sell a ticket.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Well worth the cost for a short tour on the water.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice way to see city landmarks while cruising the river
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Beautiful place, the Sealion was under construction."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Good place. Get to see a 40 min overview of the place. Stops at three places
Singapore River Cruise,5,Romantic place. Love it
Singapore River Cruise,5,By far one of the most beautiful night river cruises I've experienced.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Brilliant value and you can learn the history of Singapore.
Singapore River Cruise,4,A nice way of seeing parts of Singapore.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"This boat ride is so lovely, the view (specially at night) is wonderful, you can see Merlion park, marina bay, and other nice points of Singapore all in a very relaxing ride, plus they tell you the story behind each monument, it's really great, you can't miss it!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great view along the river and many stories to learn from it!
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Good, can try once nothing overwhelming"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Can sit river boat , sit at night better"
Singapore River Cruise,4,We had a great cruise here. Highly recommend
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Unfortunately, Merlion was under maintenance, but great view of Singapore from river."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Enjoy the cruise after 8 at night and then you are in for a visual delight
Singapore River Cruise,4,Its a nice cruise with proper audio...
Singapore River Cruise,5,Fantastic place
Singapore River Cruise,5,Awesome ride with detailed audio guide
Singapore River Cruise,5,One and only tip: Bring sunblock
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Nicr cosy place lots of pubs , food and night life around"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Beautiful cruise! A must to do this for tourists👌👌👍👍
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Highly recommended to take during evening, the lights around merlion park and the towering buildings are mesmerizing."
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Beautiful contrasting architecture, so relaxing with an interesting running commentary"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"We did a late afternoon tour, which is the best time. You get go see alot, well worth the time and money"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great boat ride! Nice scenery of Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,5,Its like revisiting the Singapore in past..its also a historical enlightenment of the place while on the cruise.
Singapore River Cruise,2,"I had a night ride. It was nice and cool. However, very poor customer service. The only question i asked was about departure time and the guy was very grumpy and barely responded. I was lost until on board. They served first to the groups from travel agencies and only treated them well. No recommended, the one in front of Hooters."
Singapore River Cruise,1,Very rude boat operators & ground staff. A shame for Singapore! A poor start to our river cruise. The boat is well maintained & clean.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Nice experience. Good clean boats
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Average value / interest quotient for the money. However, a good way to get oriented if not taking bigger conducted tours."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Warm, helpful members. Nice cruise"
Singapore River Cruise,4,The best cruise experience with safety
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Do it at night. Very scenic, plenty of info."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great experience. We were the only family onboard and were treated very well.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Nice atmosphere and good education for tourism, also knowing history about Singapore"
Singapore River Cruise,1,Treated like second class citizens paid ticket price. Allowed a tour guide crowd on first there were not enough seats so they had to get off again. Even a couple with crutches had to get off again. The staff were rude and abrupt. I won’t be taking my friends again
Singapore River Cruise,3,Bit of a must do but don't expect too much from the prerecorded commentary. Spectacular but a bit charmless.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Awesome no words loved it with my kidoooos
Singapore River Cruise,5,very beautiful place
Singapore River Cruise,4,This was really nice trip go yourselfers
Singapore River Cruise,5,Its takes almost 30 minutes to complete the river cruise.During the boat jorney you wil be told the history of those places .enjoyable time with family
Singapore River Cruise,5,It's a must in Singapore! Board just before it's about to get dark for awesome experience.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Just beautiful, no words"
Singapore River Cruise,5,So worth it
Singapore River Cruise,2,"The boat and the comentery is ok, but our dekkhand was an arogant guy. He really destroyed the trip with his very rude tone, and total lack of comitment to customer service. It all reached a high, when he started watching youtube on his mobile with his speaker on high, so we could not listen to the cometary."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Fabulous for combination of visiting animal and river cruise. Don't forget to buy amazon river ticket at the end of cruise and enjoy it also.
Singapore River Cruise,4,We had nice trip
Singapore River Cruise,1,They are not kind. Specially sailor and captain. And  ticket officer is so impolite. I dont want recommend that cruise
Singapore River Cruise,4,"Try to get on at Marina Bay Gardens location, so you have first choice of seats. Very few seats near windows. If you get lucky you can sit right at the back which is open air. We got on near Merlion Park and all the good seats were taken. It's expensive but good way to explore Boat Quay, Clark Quay and learn about the history. They play a video on a TV screen inside the boat. If you sit outside it's hard to see the TV screen, but you can listen to the commentary. There are alternate places to get on the boat cruise at near Boat Quay and Clark Quay."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Lots of photo taking on the boat! Nice view
Singapore River Cruise,1,Makes you wait beyond the stated 15minutes even when boats are parked in the bay with staff standing around smoking and chatting and taking selfies. Very bad PR for Singapore tourism. Terrible services alone make the price tag NOT worth it.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Great place for evening enjoyment
Singapore River Cruise,4,"It take you an hour to have a river cruise in the river, you can see the view of Singapore on the boat, it is recommended to have a boat ride at night time."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Nice place to take a boat ride when your in Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,1,"Very bad service. The guy is asking $18 for one way ticket to from Marina Bay Front to Clarke Quay, which is the price for the whole trip."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Nice but commentary not as good as expected
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Excellent...
You get basic Idea about River side Singapore attraction..."
Singapore River Cruise,3,The best place to view river front.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Great pizza, great staff"
Singapore River Cruise,4,A little on the pricey side but an enjoyable time. Try to time your trip just before sunset to see the whole harbour and bay area light up.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Very Nice Nature View
Singapore River Cruise,5,Lovely boat ride
Singapore River Cruise,1,"I'm here waiting for a boat but it's one hour that the boats skip the stop, in few minutes I'll ask for a refund"
Singapore River Cruise,5,Very good way to view skyline.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Must ride 👍 Don't miss it 👍😎
Singapore River Cruise,5,Enjoyable informative cruisr
Singapore River Cruise,3,"The staffs didn't explain to us properly the short and the long route.
Short route: SGD 15
Long route: SGD 25

We boarded at Merlion.
Long route sold out. Only short route, last ride.
I asked 3 times if the short route will be circling back, and the staff told me yes.
It didn't ! we were ask to leave the boat at Clark Quay.

Definitely go for the long route if you wanna try."
Singapore River Cruise,1,"The lady at the shoppes station is extremely rude, our agent booked us a ticket which starts from clarke quay without our knowledge and when we asked her if we can board from shoppes instead of clarke quay, since we are a family of 8 with kids and older people, she said it was not possible, which is understandable probably that is not in her hands but on requesting further she got very agitated and started repeating very rudely in a high pitch voice the same sentence again and again, as if we were speaking greek to her."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Exciting and entertaining feel
Singapore River Cruise,3,We did a night trip. Good value.
Singapore River Cruise,5,"Nice and historical. A great experience.Tajes about an hour. Great boats and well covered. Commentary side by side the journey is of lots of information of the bygone era.The cruise and the commentary(recorded)just like that syncronises perfectly.You can see the tall buildings, Merlion, Great hotel,Flyer and all from the cruise. Beautiful and magnificent views.Restaurents on sides.Tourists from all over the Globe visit here and experience the cruise. Through out the year tourism. Extreme winter not there.Visit to Merlion place will be complete with this cruise only. Not very costly. Easy to enter and set out of the boat. So anybody can take the ride and experience this great trip."
Singapore River Cruise,4,Beautiful and lovely experience. Esp. At night.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Enjoyed it very much.
Singapore River Cruise,3,Very nice ride
Singapore River Cruise,5,Loved the river trip and laser show.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Short but informative.
Singapore River Cruise,1,The ticketing guy was rude and unhelpful
Singapore River Cruise,5,Glittered faboulous
Singapore River Cruise,5,What a beautiful view.
Singapore River Cruise,1,"We tried to buy some tickets for a tour in the evening, so we walked to one of the sale offices at about 2 pm (Boat quay jetty). It was closed. We tried it again at Fullerton Jetty. Two girls were sitting inside the shop eating, but didn't open the window. We walked to Merlion Park Jetty. The man inside told us, that a timetable for the normal cruises doesn't exist, we could just buy a ticket (only cash) and enter the next boat at any station. We told him, that Boat Quay Jetty and Merlion Park Jetty were closed, but he negated this.
Tickets for the tour during the laser show are only available at Clarke quay Jetty, you cannot buy them anywere else.
Ultimately we didn't do a boat trip due to the unfriendliness and the lack of organization."
Singapore River Cruise,5,nice view indeed
Singapore River Cruise,4,Best to go at night
Singapore River Cruise,5,Serene and breathtaking!
Singapore River Cruise,1,Expensive & unfriendly. Do not recommend!
Singapore River Cruise,5,Boat tour at night is awesome|
Singapore River Cruise,4,Cruise offered nice scenery.
Singapore River Cruise,5,Wonderful cruise experience!
Singapore River Cruise,1,"Terrible staff service. Prioritize groups over other customers.
We waited for 1/2h and then the other group came and got on the boat first. Staff was rude and unprofessional."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Definitely a must to get a flavor of Singapore life
Singapore River Cruise,3,"A good way to start a visit to Singapore so you can orient yourself, but otherwise a bit slow and unimaginative..."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Best river cruise and city view..
Singapore River Cruise,5,Loved it 👍🏻👍🏻
Singapore River Cruise,5,Must visit attraction in Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Eh, not worth it."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Awsime view of the city in 40 mins.
Singapore River Cruise,4,Best view of Glitering Singapore in evening..
Singapore River Cruise,4,Good way to see part of Singapore
Singapore River Cruise,5,Lovely experience!
Singapore River Cruise,1,"Total waist of time. We had to wait for half an hour, and when the ticket lady told us to get onboard, the boat's captain refused to take us in. This was despite that there were just a couple of passengers boarded and plenty of spots were available. The boat staff was very rude and made angry gestures with his hands. The poorest custom service in Singapore."
Singapore River Cruise,5,Excellent ride
Singapore River Cruise,4,Not wheelchair friendly as expected.
Singapore River Cruise,5,A must do activity while in Singapore!
Singapore River Cruise,5,Beautiful cruise.
Singapore River Cruise,3,"Rushed, unfriendly staff, recorded video commentary."

Singapore River Cruise,1,Went on the cruise for the light show and could not see anything as they had to many people and not enough seats to view the light display. Very disappointed

Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) I rode around 7 o'clock and I could see both the night view and the sunset. I thought about taking a ride, but the view is different from just walking around. The wind is cool and it's perfect to sit back and watch.

7시쯤 탔더니 야경이랑 해지는거 둘다 볼 수있었음. 탈까말까 생각 많이했는데 그냥 걸어다니면서 구경하는거랑은 뷰가 또 다르다. 바람 시원하게 불어서 편하게 앉아서 구경하기 딱좋아요."

Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) It is hot in summer, so I recommend it from the evening.
The sunset reflected at Marina Bay Sands from 17:00 and it was very beautiful.
It was good to see Merlion from various angles when seen from the ship.

Singapore River Cruise,4,"(Translated by Google) A really nice tour on the river! For me, such a trip is part of it because you get a different perspective on the city and the sights. The tour takes a little over an hour and is definitely recommended! It was fun!

(Original)
Eine wirklich schöne Rundfahrt auf dem Fluß! Für mich gehört so eine Fahrt dazu, weil man einen anderen Blickwinkel auf die Stadt und die Sehenswürdigkeiten bekommt. Die Rundfahrt dauert etwas mehr als eine Stunde und ist auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen! Hat Spaß gemacht!"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) At Clarke, you can cruise across rivers with rivers in between. The course is the same, so you can ride in a comfortable place. You can enjoy a beautiful night view from the Clarke Quay to the Marina Bay Sands hotel by boarding at the scheduled time after purchase. The golden hour and the Marina Bay Sands laser show, where the glow is beautiful, are the hottest and most popular time zones, so you have to adjust your time to get on board. The cruise starts moving along the Clarke Quay and takes you to the Fluthen Hotel, Merlion Park and Marina Bay Sands Hotel, where you can enjoy a beautiful night view of Singapore for about 30 minutes. I can take a cruise and get off in the middle, but the boat does not wait. After dinner, enjoy the cool breeze and do not miss the beautiful night view of Singapore.

Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) My conclusion in advance, you should find details boring:
Great tour and especially recommended in the dark (bars and similar hotspots). For those who are only interested in culture, rather during the day.
Participate at the start of the trip / visit.
A little more detailed:
We did the boat tour on one of the last evenings of our stay and would have passed Clarke Quay liked to have had a few more days. As everywhere, where it is worth being in the evening, it is unspectacular during the day. So I recommend this tour after dark to anyone interested in Singapore's nightlife.
Of course there is also a little bit about the buildings on the river and a little history. The view of sights from the water (Marina Bay Sands, Flyer, Merlion etc.) is yet another and special.
You are about 40 minutes away.
I enclose a few pictures of our trip.

(Original)
Mein Fazit vorab, sollten Sie Details langweilig finden:
Tolle Tour und vor allen Dingen in der Dunkelheit zu empfehlen (Bars und ähnliche Hotspots). Für ausschließlich kulturell Interessierte eher am Tag.
Nehmen Sie zu Beginn der Reise / des Besuchs teil.
Etwas ausführlicher:
Wir haben die Bootstour an einem der letzten Abende unseres Aufenthalts gemacht und hätten nach der Fahrt vorbei an u.a. Clarke Quay gerne noch ein paar Tage gehabt. Wie überall, wo es sich Abends zu sein lohnt, ist es am Tag unspektakulär. So empfehle ich diese Tour nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit allen, die an Singapurs Nachtleben Interesse haben.
Natürlich ist darüber hinaus einiges über die Bauten am Fluss und ein wenig Geschichte dabei. Der Blick auf Sehenswürdigkeiten vom Wasser aus (Marina Bay Sands, Flyer, Merlion etc.) ist noch einmal ein anderer und besonderer.
Sie sind etwa 40 Minuten unterwegs.
Ein paar Bilder unserer Fahrt füge ich bei."
Singapore River Cruise,4,"(Translated by Google) You can overlook Singapore from the boat. It's hot to walk, but the wind feels good from the top of the ship. But maybe it's a little expensive ...

Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) You can watch the laser show while on the boat. If you add 10 dollars to the price of the cruiser, you can ride the laser show cruiser. It may be considered expensive, but I don't regret it because it's an opportunity that I could only have once in my life. Even if it is not a laser show, it can be said that it is a must-do cruise tour if you travel to Singapore. We know that the Laser Show Cruiser boards at 7:30 PM & 8:30 PM. I don't think it's bad to watch a laser show in front of the Expo or on the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands.

(Original)
배타면서 레이져쇼 구경할 수 있음. 크루져 가격에다가 10달러 추가하면 레이저쇼 크루저 탑승가능. 비싸다고 생각 될 수 있지만, 살면서 딱 한번일 수도 있는 기회이기도 하기때문에 후회되진않음. 레이져쇼가 아니더라도 싱가포르에 여행간다면 꼭 해봐야될 크루즈 관광이라고 말할 수 있음. 레이져쇼 크루저는 오후 7시30분 & 8시 30분에 탑승하는 것으로 알고있음. 레이져쇼를 엑스포 앞 혹은 마리나베이샌즈 옥상에서 감상해도 나쁘지않다고 생각함"
Singapore River Cruise,5,"(Translated by Google) This informative boat tour takes approximately 30 minutes and costs 25 Singapore dollars. We drive along the Singapore River around Marina Bay and Merlion Park, see the famous water-spouting Merlion statue, half fish, half lion, and marvel at the five-star luxury hotel “The Fullerton Hotel”.
In sunny weather a great opportunity to discover sights in this way.

Singapore River Cruise,4,"(Translated by Google) The night view is particularly beautiful. Singapore River is home to the otter family, and if you're lucky you can see it. It is extremely close to the city. The monitor lizard may be hidden. I often saw it in the morning. However, it may suddenly appear on the roadside instead of the river, and I was surprised at first, but it will not harm humans unless it is good enough.

If you want to watch the water dance, you may have to buy tickets early. When you were leaving yesterday, you saw a lot of people waiting in line.

There is a little wind that cools a little. I did this cruise around 5 p.m. There are few people, which is more convenient for taking beautiful photos.
To discover the essentials of Singapore, without fatigue and in the cool, this is really the ideal activity.
You can do it at night and watch the sound and light show on the water from the boat. The boat will park for the duration of the show.
I recommend this day cruise to discover the city and have a good time (Planned duration 45mn minimum).

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Purchased the unlimited ride ticket. Very worth it and value for money. The view from the cable car is very good and you may not have chance to get such view in other places in Singapore. You can even arrange to have dinner in the cable car. The sunset view is very nice and the unlimited rides ticket allow you to make multiple trips to capture the best sunset views.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,From Depot Interlace walk through the bridge up to the Henderson Reach THE PEAK...
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"A round trip sky pass (for both Sentosa and mount Faber lines) surprised our family as we took a trip on a boring afternoon. The children loved the view, kites (large birds) swooping around our cabin from time to time and amazing views of the dolphins tanks below in the dolphin cove attractions. The travel speed was Goldilocks slow, just slow enough to sit and enjoy the views. About 1.5 hours round trip. A welcomed change from all the fast paced sight seeing and activities around us!"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Initially, one will be scary to step inside the cable car seeing the height and the route. However, the journey is very comfortable and the view from this long cable car journey from Mount Faber to Sentosa is awesome.
It is definitely a wonderful experience to see the beautiful skyline of Singapore with the splendid view.
We could not enjoy the  food at the restaurant at Mount Faber as the available menu was not of our liking."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Cable car is fun ride and get to see spectacular panoramic view of Singapore from sky, lush greenery of mount Faber and aerial view of Sentosa and sea view. Ideal time to take the ride is 4pm and need 2 hours to complete both Mount Faber line and Sentosa line. You will get to see the picturesque views by sunset. Ticket price at counter is higher better purchase online."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great experience with my husband birthday month 50% voucher to redeem and go with family members best ever. Still got a lot of person getting around here. We have fun a lot. 😍
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Pricey but good touristy experience to view South Singapore from the sky. Good to keep the kids entertained. Every stop is accessible via walking or stroller/wheelchair. Best time to visit is 6+, to view the sunset and or have a different atmosphere going to and from Sentosa."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"We took the ride from Mount Faber and loved it totally.

The view from cable car is breath taking.

It is  normal to take cable car to Sentosa when we are showing the guests around.

I have had pleasant experiences taking the cable car.

You don't get to see the similar view from anywhere else when you see bright skies above and beautiful water body below you.

Enjoy the ride and scenery of sea and ships from the top.

Could not upload  my video for you ,it gives me option to share photograph only."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Nice view. Loved every minute of it. Would definitely come again.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Offers spectacular views of the Harbourfront area and Sentosa. Large and spacious cabins that could do with some upgrading (charging points, audio narration or music). Ideal for families using the Rediscover vouchers."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Nice experience, the cable car must better then 45years ago..."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"To travel to sentosa from the city, you can take the cable car ride from harbourfront station. an enjoyable ride though. The cable car also has dine-in option which is the best thing, I have ever tried. Eating your food at a greater altitude that too about the sea. Yearly passes also available which is really worth it. There are 4 stations where you can break and continue your journey. We usually take the cable car to travel from vivacity to silosa beach, almost every week before Covid."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"Now it have two different lines that travel on Sentosa, one of the line is on the island itself, and the other one travel from Mount Faber to Sentosa."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Operated by One Faber Group, Singapore Cable Car is one of the world's few aerial gondola lifts that runs over water bodies as well as urban areas like HarbourFront Towers. Opened in 1974 connecting Singapore mainland on Mount Faber with the party island of Sentosa, this aerial transport has 2 major lines under its belt - Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line. Ticket purchases are encouraged to be done online due to ongoing COVID-19 safe measurements. For eligible Singaporeans, they can use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers (SRV) through government-approved travel sites and applications i.e. Traveloka, Klook, etc. to attain cheapest discounts."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,It has been a very long time since but these new cars are very sturdy. It was such a comfortable ride I was just snapping pictures away.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great cable car ride.. very clean and cosy
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Well organized boarding. Nice views of the Sentosa area
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Long time never go by cable car to Sentosa. Go around sunset time, you can capture these beautiful sceneries in a round trip."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Hassle free booking and redemption using Klook. We entered through Harbourfront Tower and there was not much crowd. However, there should be more clearer communications on ground showing that if you have the voucher with QR Code, you don't have to queue.

But overall, fun experience! Had a pretty good time after not being on the cable car for years. Took the ride around 6pm and managed to witness the beautiful sky too. Recommended! :)

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Always such an adventure to get into the cable cars. My kids truly enjoy the sights . So much fun. The cars are always clean , we have a membership so use it regularly. Looks well maintained so feels very safe (I’m a chicken of heights so this is a plus point to know the cars are always tip top)"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Nice place to hang out
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Accessible via car. Aside from the cable car base station, there is a alfresco dining restaurant, a sunset bar and a walking trail nearby"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Breathtaking view, even at night"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"An amazing way to enter Sentosa island !!!! The prices are decent and the views from the cable car are just amazing... There are long queues during rush hours but the queue  move pretty quickly so that is not a problem. The cable cars itself are in amazing condition and are very safe. All in all, you will get a breathtaking experience with amazing views."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Good way to see the views here!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"amazing experience!! There isn't a view like this. You can see the entire Singapore from the top. The breathtaking greenery, the sea, universal. I bet the thrill that you get cannot be matched agaisnt another! I enjoyed watching a nice sunset from the cable car. Loved the experience. Looks like a dream sequence."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Amazing view!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,I felt too scare! 😂😂😂
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Could only review for the wash room.
Probably the best wash room view in Singapore.
It is clean and photo worthy"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,I afraid of height but after testing on it. It OK and safe. Car are clean and nice. Can try if you are not afraid height.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great views from cable cars across Sentosa and Siloso Beach. Bars and eateries along the beach with activities including bungee jumping and flying fox.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"It was fun being so high up and gazing below....the view from the top, picturesque🤩😍🤩😍🤩"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Its great to bring kids...nice view

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Thanks Singapore for the tourism voucher! The cable car exeprience is relaxing. Good for family to go together.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Get round about ticket for more value, nice beautiful view of sentosa and harbourfront"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"Overall a gd experience. Journey is not long.. full mt faber line takes abt 15mins & full sentosa line takes abt 10mins. However it is on the pricey side. Ticketing counter at mt faber peak is SLOW (minus 1 star), with snaking Q, so be prepared."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,You have to ride this to understand the layout of the island
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Awesome cable car rides. One and only cable car in Singapore...
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Buy the 1 year pass! And enjoy unlimited rides from harbor front to imbiah and across sentosa. Spectaculor views above sea and forest, a way to escape from the busy lifes on the grounds."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Enjoyed the rides Scenery is especially worthwhile on the Mount Faber line. Be prepared that at mount Faber itself, a number of attractions are closed (condoned off ) Sentosa line made it easier to access entertainment venues from one end of the island to the other ... Good overview of the island"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"Cable car too hot, not enough ventilation. I took it in the afternoon"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"It's a good idea to take the cable car from Harbour front to the peak, then walk to telok blangah. It will safe a lot of time."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Good and nice place to go if you never been a cable car before. Walk all the way up to the mountain might be very hot, but I have to say it is very beautiful along the way up. The cable car itself is ok, you get to see the whole sentosa island."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Pride of SG. Well sure is hot compared to taking it in Genting Highlands but well, you will be treated to a great scenery of our little island!"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"The cable car is a must-ride to get a beautiful aerial view of Singapore between Harbor Front, Mount Faber, and Sentosa. Get two different perspectives by riding one way in the day and another at night. If you like a little thrill, take the one with a glass bottom which allows you to see the landscape go by under your feet.

That's also  a fun way to visit Sentosa besides taking the monorail or driving to the resort island. Furthermore, the Cable Car Musuem is at the drop off point on Sentosa where you get to learn of the history and evolution of the cable car system."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,We book from Klook and find it quit cheap. We been through all 6 station and the view was fantastic.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Picturesque views, very silent and stable, airy comfortable cabin. Highly recommended."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Scenic view of Sentosa ♥
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"We boarded the cable car from Siloso Point. I booked the ticket on the spot on Klook to get a better price. The cable car gives a breathtaking, bird-eye view of the entire Sentosa and scenic view of beach coastline. Wonderful experience!"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Great. And the annual pass is very reasonably priced. My son loves it. But please take the automatic song and video off in the cable car!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Superb way to cross to the santosa island with a million dollar 💵 view. Station itself a nice place the hangout with restaurants to feed your taste buds
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,"The cable itself is great but there were a lot of communications flaws that make you feel they don't genuinly care about their customers:

1. First they charge 10$ more expensive for counter tickets than online which was quite shocking and a bit of a waste of time.
2. The person at the counter told us that the 2 way trip included the whole cable cars but in fsct it only included 1 lf the 2 cable car and then they charge you extra if you want to do the one on sentosa. Felt a lot like a money squeeze and back packaging.

Overall good to do once but those issues didn't make us feel we would like to go back."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,One of bst. things to do...this 45mins cable car gives u view of entire Singapore nd santosa island..
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,"Change scam !
Be careful. Tried to give back 20 bath note.

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,There was no need to queue and the ride was an enjoyable experience.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"We Don't Ride The Cable Car But We Enjoy The Customer Service With The Information Of The Cable Car.
Service Execellence And Thumbs Up👍🏻"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"This is the beginning of the Mount Faber Sky Cable car of Singapore. I recommend that you come to take the cable car from the peak of the mount faber and follow the cable line thought Habourfront and continue to Sentosa. Then change the line by 2mn walk to continue to either Merlion or Siloso beach. Each part of the ride give different views: mountain, sea, port, city, sentosa island, universal studio, merlion, beach, ....."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Just love it. Beautiful views of Singapore downtown on one side and Sentisa island and the sea on the other side
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Missing proper cafe at the difference stations or anything to do really. Other than just take the cable car and run in cycles, nothing else"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Beautiful views of the harbour and island, cosy cable car that is stable and not scary."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Nice place for Tourist photo taking
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Since we all are stuck on this red dot. Take this means of transportation  to get a going  overseas feeling. At least you are out of the effing island.
Most of us are at breaking point to go out of this country for a real break.
Ok ok back to the Singapore cable car.
Enjoyed the ride as always. Almost memorized the in cabin narration as been taking it too often divert my attention that
We can't really get out of this country yet. Overall, I bought the licence so I don't have to worry much about the cost. Travel as much you want for 1 year. I guess by the time it expires, we should be able to use our ""powerful"" passport again.🥴. Else there might be massive mental Illness."

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Nice ride. We liked the view and my 3yo had lots of fun!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,"Nice views but crazy prices for something which is merely a ride to Sentosa. Save your money, take the bus and enjoy more stuff inside Sentosa."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Its wonderful experience and very romantic if you go with your partner
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,prices are high. but kids enjoy a lot.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Obligatory must do in todo list. Island of diversity of completely entertainment and for calm and relax and sport extreme and fun! For adults and children! It’s not just universal Studios and water park. You could not going there. It’s very big area for exploring to walk, for pic and even you can find real island nature. Take a ticket for round trip with 2 cable car way exactly!you would be happy! It’s deserving to spend even 1 all day for this! Envoy! Hope it’ll be useful for someone)"

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Its best to take the ride from Mount Faber, beautiful view and worth the experiences."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,courteous and friendly staff. helps out and holds out their hands to people they think needs to when boarding and leaving the gondolas. DON'T forget to have your hand stamped at the very first station you get to ride your first. They are supposed to do that.I suggest getting the day pass and the extras especially for the Merlion tour/photo taking
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Loved the experience so much that i upgraded one day ticket to annual membership

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great view of Singapore
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,I would to have endless rides as the view is just breathtaking. Good thing everyone gets to ride to in order to make it to the studio. Everyone should ride this as words just dont do the justice to it's beauty.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,"We checked the waiting queue before purchasing tickets and it seemed reasonable. After getting in the queue we found that it had a huge part after the building corner. The heat in the line after corner is exhausting.

If we knew about the more than an hour wait we wouldn’t have purchased tickets."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Very nice experience. A must visit for tourists. One of the ways to enter Sentosa island. Make sure you cover all the stations and morning and evening times. Do visit Faber peak as cable car is the fastest and easiest way to go there. It runs till 9:30 in night so plan accordingly.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Used the cable car to get from mainland to mount Faber park and to get around the island. The cable cars are clean and it is mapped out very clearly so easy to navigate around using the cable cars. The views are stunning, particularly at sunset time."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Gulbuddin
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Love the view
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Actually a very fun ride that does a round trip of about 40-60 minutes. The segment from Mt Faber to Sentosa goes quite high. Exhilarating and yet a bit nerve racking if you have a fear of heights. My British visitors love it because we were able to have a short stop at  beautiful Siloso Beach and take some sunset pictures with coconut trees as the backdrop. Tropical and gorgeous.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Awesome view in the evening
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Very convenient and entertaining for kids. Had some trouble with one of the staff members there, complaint was launched and addressed very aptly by the management."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Very nice place
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,It's a really good time experienced.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Very easy way to hop over to Sentosa Island. Beautiful views over the city. Very modern cars that make you feel safe at any time. The only downside is the pricing. Taxi would be cheaper, but, by far not as nice."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,what an experience it was
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Exciting place gives you a good view of South Singapore. I loved travelling Cable car.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Beautiful night view
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Our favorite family outing!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Great experience to have, it goes via mount Faber then over harbour front and then multiple stations in Sentosa."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,Tourist overrated and an hour waiting line. Take a Grab instead. Save time and money!!!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Nice views but too pricey. Can save your money, take the bus and enjoy more stuff inside Sentosa"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! If you want to go to Sentosa, this is the way to do it. The ticket is very affordable (19$ per person) and the views are truly worth it. Singapore looks gorgeous from above, (as if anyone didn't already know that), but you also get to fly above the beautiful sea and the picturesque Sentosa which looks magical.
A pro-tip would be to space out your trip so you would get to experience the views both in their day version and night version, which are both uniquely beautiful and worth it."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Great views from the cable car. There are multiple routes, make sure you take the right route"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Safe and clean
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Always a great experience, nice breeze. Their annual membership is a must, every cent worth. One of the peaceful tours for me to just sit and keep going."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,I amazed to see this cable car. We get a fantastic view of the Singapore at the cable car.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,Good
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great views. Ticket includes back and fourth. Which is good. Walk i would opt out as its not great and has lots of mosquitos.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Everyone must travel in cable car 😃 best experience.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,For sightseeing from above. Also near Faber peak a beautiful forest walk.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"My wife and I went to Sentosa and enjoyed our time there and we wanted to return on the Cable Car and were surprised that price was for two way only. We think people should be able to pay a cheaper price for a one way trip.
The view was okay but we got a better view of Singapore from the Observation Deck on top of Marina Bay Sands.
Visited April 2015"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Nice view from top
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Would definitely recommend when in Singapore, you get to see all of it from the top.

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Must not miss this experience if your visiting Singapore. The cable car rides provided a great view of the Singapore and the Sentosa Island. I recommend ordering your tickets online in order to save money and skip the queue.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Nice scenic view all the way along, and our trip is from HarbourFront Station > Mount Faber Station > HarbourFront Station > Universal > HarbourFront Station.

This location has a souvenir shop and a cafe. But if you are ending the cable car ride from here, need to consider the transportation because no bus or taxi."

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,First time I ever rode a cable car. Unforgettable! ♥
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great view of the shore. Bought tickets online easily and what an incredible ride!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,A exciting ride on the cable car to sentosa island. Starting from Mount Faber to the island . Do take the ride when visiting sentosa for the experience. The ticket includes the cable car on the island from Merlion to Silosa. I have posted a hyperlapse video of the ride to give you a feel of the thrill.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Mesmerizing
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,This is a very scenic ride and is a must do if you have kids. You can get really good pics and it's a convenient way to travel in Sentosa.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Beautiful views and decent ride duration.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Great view! Tourist destination in Singapore.
A better alternative and a bit expensive transport to Sentosa but gives a good view while travelling! 👍"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Well known good n fantastic experience
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Best view to see sentosa island in singapore. There is cafe with great view as well
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great experience and not too expensive. Awesome views of the harbor. The best way to get up or down Mount Faber
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,"view is okay, better to go to mt farbor directly and enjoy park. After hiking in Norway & other countries you learn there are much better views"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Good maintenance.. welled trainers
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Beautiful and serene views throughout .... Sunset view is recommended ...
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Great! Just don't love heights
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Gives you the Arial view of Resorts world santosa..
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Used the cable car to visit Santosa. Unlimited cable car use and 2 attractions on the island for $50. The cabins modern and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Excellent experience
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"One of the 3 ways to enter into Sentosa and I must say the most glorious way to enter into Sentosa. Cable Car gives you a birds eye view of a very prominent and happening area of Singapore, amazing connectivity. A must while visiting Singapore."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,If you're heading to Sentosa or Mt Faber you may as well travel by the cable car & get nice views. It's reasonably priced & comfortable.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Absolutely beautiful! Must try
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"nice experience seeing mount faber and sentosa island from above. it is also useful as an alternative for travel from the main island to sentosa island. get your ticket from travel agent online, it is cheaper, around $20 for the whole roundtrip package."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Love it so much, we bought the 1 year pass for two adults and two kids. Perfect way to travel to sentosa and avoid the crowd in the trams!"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Great view of parts of harbor.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,"Views are ok. Expensive for what it is.
Got this from Sentosa to Mount Faber, which is essentially a pub and souvenir shop. There are no taxis at Mount Faber so we had to get the cable car back to Harbourcity to find a cab."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Another great attraction!
Best way to see all of the city and coast in Singapore 😉Great also for families and if you want transport to Sentosa attractions"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,View of Sentosa is fantastic. Ride is scenic and a must do in Singapore.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Stable cable. Great views Singapore's theme parks, beaches, hills, and the port."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"We bought annual islander pass, which costs 1-2 one time passes to the cable car. So now we can enter the island all year round for free using any type of transport including cable car, which is btw quite convenient."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"The rides were great, just that the ticket purchase line at mount faber was slow. Also, it would be good if there were signs at the ticket counter Q to tell those who purchased vouchers on Safra website that they still have to join the ticket queue to redeem the tickets.

Of course, it would be even better if we could skip the Q and redemption process as it is time consuming i.e. recognize the safra vouchers directly."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"Ride the cable car if you visit Singapore. Enjoy the scenic Singapore harbour view overseeing the fun resort island of Sentosa. Start from the Mount Faber station. If you are inland at Sentosa, you can try the inland line which lets you enjoy the Sentosa beach view and the open sea beyond."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,Very hot n stuffy.. Boring scenery . Uncomfortablefoe the price.  The one to mount Faber is worst.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,U can get an awesome view of santosa island
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,There were two of the first cable cars which have been used for transportation. Nice for memorial photos.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,A wonderful place for family hang out
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,Lovely views but not much to see on Sentosa
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Fun ride to get to the island.  Families welcome and the staff will try to place you in your own car.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,An unmissable attraction when visiting Singapore. The views are incredible!!
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Wonderful experience overseing Singapore city and sentosa island
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"The best way to enter the magical island of Santosa. Although a tad bit more expensive than the other alternatives available to enter Santosa island, the cable car is the most flamboyant one by far, allowing you to gaze upon the beauty of the mystic island through a birds eye view. Definitely a must for anyone visiting Singapore and Santosa island."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,Very sad what happened with  beautiful  Sentosa
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,It was fantastic ride

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,Expensive
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Hiking and viewing.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Very Scenic View of the city from the cable car.
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),3,"I had bought 2 tickets online. Went to the ticket counter at Harbourfront, was told to go to Vivo side to collect tickets. Why can't one collect from HBF side? Went to Vivo had to join long snaking queue! The reason why people buy online is so to avoid queuing. There should be a counter for people who had booked and paid online. So much unnecessary hassle."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"Best way to see the scenic views of singapore  , and best way to go from singapore to sentosa island"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"We enjoyed a lot over there, excellent view."
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,The experience of life
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),1,"It was very unclear that we had to collect paper tickets from our online purchase since we got a QR code, and when it was our turn to board the ticket lady said we had to go down and collect them in the booth. My boyfriend went down but I wasn't allowed to keep our spot in line. So we had to stand in line all over again and the staff were REALLY unprofessional about it. When customers spend 33$ on a single ride - LEARN SOME SERVICE PLEASE??"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),2,"Expensive and short. A disappointment... If u can afford, go for it. If not than just walk or take a monorail into sentosa. Much cheaper"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Good experience while going to Sentosa resort
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,Cool it is good I had to ride it 3 times😊😊😊

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"(Translated by Google) Mount Faber~Sentosa
It used to be a long queue to take a cable car, and it took an hour to wait. Now due to the epidemic situation, even if it is a holiday, there are not many people, the service staff still retain their enthusiasm, and they all spray and disinfect the tourists after they leave the station.

When boarding, the scenery is unobstructed, a great experience

搭乘时，风景一览无遗，很棒的体验"
Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,Sentosa adasına gitmek için meraktan kullandım. Metro ile ulaşmak için Harbour Front istasyonuna ulaşıp exit B çıkışını takip etmelisiniz. Kısa ve uzun hat olmak üzere 2 farklı ücret var. Faber mount ve Sentosa hatları dahil fiyat 35 SGD. Sadece Sentosa ise 15 SGD. Faber mount ta bir tepe ve panoramik manzara seyredilebiliyor. Aslında buraya gidilmese de olur. Sentosa adasında ise 3 istasyon var ve her istasyonda inerek çevreyi gezebilirsiniz. Kabinler çok büyük değil. Dışarısı net olarak izlenebiliyor. Manzara güzel. Tavsiye ederim.

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"(Translated by Google) Singapore is very beautiful but warm and humid most of the year and very expensive, we were on a cable car, the tickets are very expensive, but the shaker can be easily given up and taken to Santosa Island with a free train that leaves every few minutes. Santosa Island has an amazing royal beach with year-round hot water, highly recommended

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),4,"(Translated by Google) Very nice little walk to go to the island of Sentosa. To do in the middle of the day or in the evening. You can even have lunch in a certain cabin with the dinning option. It costs $ 288 per couple. The ticket for the two cable car lines (sentosa and Mont faber) is 35 $ S I still advise you to go on the internet when we were there I paid 37 $ S for the two of us online.

Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa),5,"(Translated by Google) I used it with my family when I went to Sentosa Island,
There is a gondola platform on Mount Faber, the view to Sentosa Island on the gondola is the best, and there are various ways to get to Sentosa Island, but it is the most recommended.
The price is a little high, but if you search online, there are many sites where you can buy tickets at a discounted rate, and there are also sites that support Japanese.

If you want to spend a day in Sentosa and want to turn it long and wide I recommend the day pass (they give you the blue bracelet) and you can go up and down unlimitedly, visit the beaches, wander around the resort and watch the evening shows of wings of time, unmissable. Perfect for taking photos of the city from another angle and seeing the beauties of Sentosa. Highly recommended !!!

Struttura inaugurata nel 1974 ma sembra nuova di zecca.

The world is so progressive and beautiful that we are now more expose to possibilities and expose to the world. It was a great feeling teaching eager students.

At one time, Singapore River was the very lifeblood of the colony, the trade artery, the center of commercial activity, the heart of entrepot trade, the vessel of importance, the capillaries of life and the place which was frequented by the secret societies, the swaylos (Cantonese for coolies who worked on a boat) and the coolies who worked for the philanthropist Tan Tock Seng at Ellenborough Market and the towkay (Hokkien for business owner) Tan Kim Seng who was busy filling his godown with the riches of the East.
Thanks"

Singapore River,5,"Night cruise is the best way to enjoy the beautiful skyline of Singapore as it sparkles against the night while the ripples of the river reflect the show in glittering splendor.

There are multiple points where you can board the cruise; near Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton One or Clarke Quay.

The smooth ride will introduce you to the modern architectures of Marina Bay Sands Hotel & the Esplanade theater, the historical landmarks like the Merlion & the Cavenagh Bridge, the towering structures that make up the financial district, and the colorful vibrant Clarke Quay.

December to January are probably the best months to take a cruise (day and night) with cooler temperature. Just check the weather forecast for rain."
Singapore River,5,Well paved & lighted walk way with plenty of 2nd hand smoke and cig butt litters. A historical site that is abused by these irresponsible foreigners & pest.

ION Orchard,3,Went on Tuesday which was a public holiday. Parking was ok. Used the points to pay for parking linked directly to IU. Mall was not crowded. Good to walk about during this period I guess
ION Orchard,5,"A nice array of retail and F&B establishment for those with discerning tastes. Shopping on a week-day makes for a pleasant experience due to the lack of crowds.

Makes for a nice place to hang-out with friends and loved ones especially with all the swanky boutiques, cafes and restaurants."
ION Orchard,5,"This is a high end retail mall. Top branded goods have their physical store at this location. During my weekday visit, the place seem empty. The store too. Only exception I notice that the cafe and others eating establishment are full of crowds."
ION Orchard,4,"Went today and didn't expect the food court is no dinning in available. Explore and managed to try the food stall Famous eunos bak chor mee, very nice meat ball and wonton. The soup base is also very good except the pork lar is not crispy"
ION Orchard,5,It hosts tons of high quality restaurants and luxury brands and interlinks with Wheelock place. It is no wonder there is overcrowding even during covid timing.
ION Orchard,5,Absolutely love the night lights at Orchard Ion. This magnificent mall comes alive at night and I love the large screen that keeps viewers mesmerized with the ads that run. Quite an iconic place to hang out during the day and at night. The LV installation is quite a big hit !
ION Orchard,5,"Visit the best mall in SINGAPORE, don't be confused if it looks small initially. Go to the basement floors and you will realize the true size. High end brands on  1 and B1. More affordable brands on B2 / B3."
ION Orchard,5,"Had a quick run recently to ION for redemption of vouchers (please note this can be done at concierge @ level 4 only). Staff was very friendly, prompt in service and even gave me a small envelope for the vouchers. Appreciate the warm touch!"
ION Orchard,4,"Ion Orchard, luxury goods mall from ground floor onwards and other brands of shops on their basement. The mall is linked to Vista Atrium."
ION Orchard,5,this place is good atmosphere and nice food.
ION Orchard,4,Too crowded in weekends and only weekdays are good for shopping 😁

ION Orchard,4,Just walking from outside…it is so different now
ION Orchard,5,Great place. Attached to the MRT. Lots of options for shopping. Enough to get confused by wings and floors. Haha
ION Orchard,5,Probably the best premier malls in Singapore. Doubt many people don't know what is the meaning of ION Orchard. It means I On Orchard. From luxury retailers to your day to day needs. Basements got lots of nice food too.
ION Orchard,3,During this festive season. I always enjoy coming to Orchard and check their Christmas Deco.
ION Orchard,3,"Food is quite nice but it's expensive too. Servicing is quite slow , shortage of staff"
ION Orchard,4,"An all in one mall basically you can get everything from cheap food to salons, beauty brands, mid-ranged fashion to high end luxury brands. All types of restaurants and cafes. Good connectivity with public transport, linked to orchard MRT station and bus stations. Also links to wheelock place and Shaw center via underground."

ION Orchard,5,"We did the Food and Heritage trail, it was excellent! Our guide was friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. It was interesting to learn a bit about the history of the Orchard area as well as the shopping centre. The food samples were delicious! We had to come back another time to use our food voucher because we were full!"
ION Orchard,5,Great place to shop and dine at ION.
ION Orchard,5,"Ion Orchard is the ultimate place for Luxury shopping. There is Louis Vuttion, Tiffany and Co, Prada, Dior and much more. There is also middle end stores like H and M and Uniqlo along with a food court at the basement.
Visit Ion Sky if you can."
ION Orchard,5,"Perhaps it is the biggest shopping mall in Singapore. You will find all kind of goods here, but of course, those are the more up market products and services. Here the rental is unimaginably high. Sometimes, one cannot figure out how the retail shops remain profitable. Many a times we suspect they have other income or are supported by deep pockets."
ION Orchard,5,Fantastic restaurant at the very top of the building! Enjoy the view and the tasty food!
ION Orchard,1,No more parking grace period
ION Orchard,5,Nice place to shop. Food court prices are higher than most in orchard road area. You can try opposite mall Shaw House Isetan Basement Food Court for other varieties of foods.
ION Orchard,5,"Truly a unique experience. This is my first trip after a long break and this mall has everything. I was so happy to see they have Foreo, my favorite brand."
ION Orchard,4,"Upmarket mall with high end brands, load yourself with $$$$ and enjoy as you go."

ION Orchard,5,Nice Mall in orchard main road. love the atmosphere in here. loved to sit in front of this mall just to enjoy the city view of Orchard road.
ION Orchard,4,"Bought my watches here!!! Great for luxury brands. If you seek designer brands, here’s where you’ll find most of them around here. Food options can get pricey."
ION Orchard,5,The toilet itself deserves 5 stars. Kudos to the people keeping it in sublime condition.
ION Orchard,5,I like this place. Good shopping. Easy to get to. A lot of shops to look at. Higher end luxury items found here. Very good place to spend a weekend.
ION Orchard,5,"High end shopping on Orchard Road, the shopping mecca of Asia. Known for swish boutiques and high street brands, this place may be limited for those who want just everyday things. Aside to big brands, this place has nice cafes and restaurants for a range of cuisines and price points. Worthy of a visit."
ION Orchard,5,"Orchard mall is located on Orchard Street in Singapore.  There is everything in a very large shopping center.  Food & Beverage, clothing, cosmetics, care, entertainment areas, playing area for kids.  You should go here to have a nice time with your family or friend."
ION Orchard,5,Great selection for food and shopping. There are always new dining options every now and then :) toilets are always clean when I visit and the whole place just feels really classy and on point
ION Orchard,5,"This is a Monster mall! So full of branded shops, with a lot of other complimentary products and services that makes this mall so useful. Have a look at the design, it is like a jewel. Perfect for some shopping spree."
ION Orchard,5,"The beautiful Orchard road where you see the wonderful Ion Mall and many other malls. Its better you go in the evening then only you'll be able to feel the real aura of that place. Everything lighted up and glitters everywhere. One more thing, the cleanliness is of the top level in Singapore. You can even sit on the stairs outside the mall, its more neat & clean than your own houses.. Really must visit, if you are going to Singapore...."
ION Orchard,3,I really love the building design... Nice mall with variety of shops ... There is Pizza shop in food court... For us as tourists we prefer to have Italian restaurant... I did not understand one thing when we purchased the pizza we eat it in the food court and the cleaner asked us to through the Garbage because it's outside food although from same floor she mentioned u may buy any drink and set 🤔
ION Orchard,5,"Vibrant, bustling and effervescent. That is ION. The large footfall, especially in the lower floors, can be attributed to the MRT and also the incredible array of retail outlets here in the vicinity. ION is the capital of the Orchard Road belt, and its elegant modern design is another factor which attracts the crowds in by the masses."
ION Orchard,4,"Went window shopping. Very nice shops, high class."
ION Orchard,4,"One of Singapore’s high end malls which is very well located right in the middle between cross Orchard road and Scotts road as well as being situated right on top on Orchard MRT. It is also very well connected underground which are linked to other major malls such as Wisma, TANGS Orchard, Wheelock place and Isetan Scott. There are a huge varieties of food and beverages options from pop up stores to posh restaurants as well as apparels for all age groups."
ION Orchard,5,"Modern building with very luxurious shops inside. Designer brands occupy the first floors. The basement are a good mix of food, shops and clothing stores. Sephora is here too. Love it when there’s a sale, always fun to find some good sales."
ION Orchard,4,"Went for a great window shopping session. Everything in one place, from the high end brand to lower end brand. Quite similar to Pavillion in KL"
ION Orchard,5,A great variety of shops for all ages..fascinating
ION Orchard,5,"""I found all the designer stores more expensive than Toronto. Worthwhile to note price tags at LV or Prada etc will have tax included. Many places offer 10% off to tourists. Fantastic restaurants here, beautiful shops if you’re willing to pay 10-15% more than Canada even with the exchange rate"""
ION Orchard,5,A mall in a new and good condition the mall isn’t crowded and it is located in the mid-Orchard location is excellent! I recommend this mall for people wants to know Singapore more.
ION Orchard,5,At this time due to now not as busy at two years ago. But now business is picking up. And many shop are busy now. Due to festive season. I wish can own a shop there. Things are reasonably cheap and good for young customer.
ION Orchard,4,Christmas decoration makes the ambience excellent. It might be a nice place for shopping luxury brands and enjoying the good restaurant on the higher floor. But I recommend here for one of best photo places as a well known landmark in Singapore.
ION Orchard,5,ION Orchard mall is one of the posh shopping malls I have visited in Singapore. It is easily accessible through public transport and through metered cabs as well. There are plenty of fashion retail shops and good choice Jewellery shops at the basement. There is well control of the crowds with safe entry and tracking the patrons temperature. I would definately recommend a visit to this mall.
ION Orchard,5,So wonderful view off Orchard rd area. At level 55 wedding venue .It place me on top off the world.
ION Orchard,5,"This is the place you need to visit not only for Branded hand bag, but also there's a lot of good cafe and restaurants you can enjoy. Must go."

And if you take MRT can direct connected from B3. One of the famous shopping mall in Orchard road,Spore. Must visit Bread Society,the bread fresh and taste soft."

ION Orchard,5,Nice n spacious mall. One of the Best shopping mall in town
ION Orchard,5,"Top shopping mall in Orchard. It’s well organised and compact, with walking to a minimum and you will get to shops and restaurants as compared to the other shopping malls like Ngee Ann City which is huge but spans a large area to walk."

Located in the heartland of singapore, it's right at orchard mrt station. If looking for branded accessories or branded goods it would be the most ideal area to shop for it"

ION Orchard,5,"The best shopping Centre in the heart of Orchard Road. There is Orchard MRT downstairs, and then you are greeted with crossroads to every shopping mall around this area. Nearest being, ION. Walk in, and you can spend the whole day here, morning till closing. Because there are so many shops, so many levels, and so much to eat and drink, there is no way you can finish this mall within the day.

Luxury branded items, to makeup, to $2 Daiso, to restaurants, to art gallery, to IT, to stationary, to cafes, to groceries, and on, and on.

Quick tip, underground links to other malls in the area, so when it rains, you can still move around Orchard without getting wet."

ION Orchard,5,Five star shopping mall in central shopping district. MRT downstairs serves millions of passengers a day so it is crowded all the time. Super luxury shopping
ION Orchard,5,"ION ORCHARD MALL is the biggest and most popular luxury mall in Singapore located on orchard Road. This mall has almost all the luxury brands like GUCCI, FENDI, LYS, CHANEL, DKNY, ZARA, SEPHORA, KOREAN BRAND SKINCLIQUE, RADO, MARK AND SPENCER, etc etc.
This mall is very huge and has multiple up and down levels connected to mrt Station.
Over here one can buy jewellery, watches, purses, hand bag and luggage, cloths, make up stuff, sovaniors, assorted coffee and chocolates, gift items, shoes, fragrance, etc etc.
Then on level b down you can have yummy pan Asian food or if you don't want to eat Asian cuisine then there is mc Donald and Starbucks too.
I would personally suggest that you must try local cuisine as well as its yummy and healthy and in 10 dollars one can have tummy filling meal
One more thing washrooms are very clean and has sensors just one thing it doesn't have jetter so one has to use sanitizers and tissues to clean up. But all in all I had a great shopping experience over here in ION MALL ORCHARD ROAD SINGAPORE"

Do go to the basement, hidden gems there."
ION Orchard,1,"I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND visit ION Orchard due to expensive parking fee. There only 10minute grace period thereafter s$4.28++ parking fee. The parking timer start from ground/street level, thereafter you need to go up 5storey high in order to start to look for parking, it may took you more than 10minute to drive up and merry go round only to find there not enougj parking lot, thereafter you would have exceeded the 10min grace period."
ION Orchard,5,"Love ION as always,the fragrance of the place and how cozy it is.Lots of stuff to check and buy like clothings,cosmetics and now it’s Christman in ION Orchard❤️🎅🏻Merry Christmas Everyone❤️"

ION Orchard,5,"Fantastic huge mall with almost every major brand that's available in Singapore. Mix of high-end and the more affordable such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, Cotton On, Topshop.

It is like a giant maze so can be easy to get lost. Luckily, like most malls in Singapore there is fast and free Wi-Fi throughout. So I recommend going to their website to help you navigate and find what you're looking for.

Make this your first stop on Orchard Rd! You may not have any need to step outside."

Most iconic is the beehive nest look and at the night the glow is most beautiful. During December period it dresses even better with extraordinary lightings. Step out and the orchard road gives a day full of experiences to shop."
ION Orchard,5,Lovely place that is Scented and has free wifi. Good location and big. Supposedly the best mall in Singapore.
ION Orchard,4,"Most malls are all the same... too many overpriced stores. This one is well kept and is connected to the metro subway line, making easy to access.

This mall is included as the other prestigious mall besides Marina Bay Sands, but in Orchard rd. The different thing than MBS, there are more affordable brands offered in this mall and the design for ION orchard is more into futuristic and modern, not luxurious like MBS.

There is also a MRT called ""Orchard rd"", so it's easy to come here through MRT. Besides, many people usually walk around ION on the outside since the view is a typical legendary scene in Singapore, especially if you want to eat the ice cream with bread which is well known as Singaporean Ice Cream.

The food hall in here is included as expensive in the Orchard rd since if you go to the lucky plaza you could get 20-30% cheaper. However, the food hall provides several various foods from Indonesia, Chinese, India, etc.

Overall I recommend for all travelers to come here if you want to shop!"
ION Orchard,4,Nice n clean. Hope Covid to clear asap so people can come here n b merry.

It's directly outside Orchard Mrt and has a taxi stand of it's own.

There are many premium restaurants in Ion as well as cafe, and food court that caters to all.

Many of the big brands (e.g Prada, Tiffany and Co, etc) are also located here as an one stop place for shopping.

The whole street is a must see when in Singapore, but don’t miss walking on the Tangs side of the street as it has a more ‘local’ feel."

ION Orchard,5,"Love how the ambience there, specially when christmas season"
ION Orchard,5,"Good shopping mall. Downstairs is full of good food. This mall gets my five stars, and one particular Brand gets none! Make a guess, my fav brand...LV!

LV here not the best, go to the MBS shop to see it done right. Here, they make you stand in a queue and wait 15-30mins even with light traffic. FYI, we have to work to earn the money to spend on your products, so let’s not waste our time.

Go get a bigger shop and more staff if you think you cannot handle the customers, don’t make the customers suffer when they are willing to pay. LV at MBS doesn’t have a queue. Why should this one have it? Of course, that one is the big shop with lots of acreage. A lot of staff too. There, problem solved for you. Go do that. Try harder!

Besides, we know LV are desirable, no need for all these marketing stunts. And don’t start putting a queue into MBS LV just to have a consistent shopping experience, lowering that standard isn’t going to get you any brownie points."
ION Orchard,5,Very awesome place for shopping
ION Orchard,4,Try Poulet+ food is good here
ION Orchard,5,"ION Orchard mall is among the posh shopping malls of Singapore. It is easily accessible through public transport and through metered cabs as well.

ION Orchard,5,Easy access from MRT with hundreds of stores for exploring.
ION Orchard,5,"One of Singapore's most popular and iconic mall. Great selection of food in the basement and various types of fashion, electronics and consumer goods. If you can't decide what to eat, it's a good idea to explore the basement food hall where there are various food kiosks to try local and international dishes. Depending on peak (lunch time 12-2pm and dinner 6-8pm) you could head to the food court where there are even more selections of food with tables so that you can sit down comfortably to enjoy your meal. Just be aware that if there are packets of tissue paper on the table, more likely than not the table is taken. It's just a local way to represent that the table is taken."

ION Orchard,5,With my own true real gf
ION Orchard,1,The management needs to reflect its policy. Felt betrayed when my carpark points from no expiry to become expired just because the management had the policy changed. There should be an effective date for policy be implemented. And management seemed to avoid my calls/emails. A luxury mall but with such management?
ION Orchard,5,Always a pleasant place to shop & chill.
ION Orchard,4,Got to go all the way down to the bottom for great food. Well worth the ride into the bowls of the building.
ION Orchard,5,Great place to hang out with my friends. The place is so clean and comfortable. Went to shopping and the services we received were remarkable!
ION Orchard,5,Very nice place to pass by
ION Orchard,3,"The mall shops are combined mostly of expensive brands. The mall itself is relatively small but with modern design. There is a food court in most lower level with most of the shops of Asian cuisine. No halal restaurants there, not even fast food chains, except for 4 Fingers."
ION Orchard,5,The popular place for tourist and shoping
ION Orchard,5,"I went ion branch recently and I was served by Felicia Lin, she is always smiley and giving revelant opinions to my indecisive decision. She has also introduced and explained detailed regards to Star carat diamond which I'm impressed. Will definitely recommend to friends."
ION Orchard,5,Hi society Shopping place
ION Orchard,5,"Came here on our first ever visit to Singapore. You can book with tourist office, and you get a personal tour (there were only two of us on the day, my wife & I). At the end of the tour, you visit the food court and try samples of 5 or 6 different dishes, all for free, and then we were both given 5 dollar vouchers to spend anywhere in the mall. We got two packs of biscuits and two bottles of water, all for free. Highly recommended."

ION Orchard,5,The iconic mall in Singapore. So many great choices.. a lot of food selection.. fashion boutiques.. electronics and more! There are luxury choices here too.
ION Orchard,5,"ION is an amazing mall.  It contains numerous levels with connections to other shopping facilities and the metro underground.  Most upscale shops have spaces, and you'll find less glamorous stores also.  It is a truly unique shopping experience."
ION Orchard,5,"Mixed use development. Resi on top and shopping mall below. B2 is link to the Orchard MRT. Foodcourt is at B4. High-end shops like Prada, MiuMiu, Valentino,LV, Tiffany, Ferragamo is located at 1st Storey."

ION Orchard,4,Glamorous department store in this place. There are plenty of shops can be found here and also the cost is justifiable as well. Good to go.
ION Orchard,4,Concierge!
ION Orchard,5,Large mall on the iconic Orchard Street of Singapore. They have several levels with all the major brands from all over the world along with stores under the main road that acts as a subway to cross over due to the heavy traffic on the streets above.
ION Orchard,2,"So annoying ,Took me awhile to get to Wheelock place through the underpass when exit from Orchard MRT.

So confusing when I check-in Ion and I walked to Wheelock without having to check in.
They should create another Lane Direct to Wheelock Mall."
ION Orchard,5,Awesome! The shopping mall is fantastic. There's a lot of options and choices. You will really enjoy plus it's very accessible 😉
ION Orchard,4,"It's a happening place, with street performances and live music."

ION Orchard,5,Awesome!
ION Orchard,5,Great Ambience & Tenant Mixed 🤗
ION Orchard,3,It's OK. I enjoy the fact it is central and have decent food options. Although I usually stick to the basement shops. Everthing from Level 1 and up tend to be a little pricey for me.
ION Orchard,5,"Shopping Paradise if you can afford to. Worth a visit as a tourist to just take it all in as you ""window shop"" like me"
ION Orchard,5,Endless hours of shopping!
ION Orchard,5,One of many malls in orchard street
ION Orchard,5,Vast variety of eateries and retail shops. Great place to hang out with friends and family. Gets crowded after 6pm on weekdays and just smothered with people on the weekends. Make sure to keep your receipts to enter the sky deck which closes at 8pm. Viewing gallery before the sky deck holds some interesting art pieces.

ION Orchard,5,One of the expensive shopping area.. but the collection here is really good!
ION Orchard,4,The shopping mall is linked to Orchard MRT and offers you a range of branded retailers. I don't usually visit the place except near to Christmas period where you can walk from Orchard to Plaza Singapura and admiring the beautiful Christmas theme decoration.
ION Orchard,5,"Amazing shopping mall situated on iconic Orchard Road. Eight floors with hundreds of shops, restaurants and cafes. Subterranean access to adjacent shopping malls and public transport system, you can spend all day underground shopping, eating and walking. Fantastic but extremely busy in peak times with thousands of commuters making their way from the MRT. Shopping heaven."
ION Orchard,5,Nice small shoppibg mall for the thousands of pedestrians
ION Orchard,4,Big and spacious shopping centre  for low to high end budgets. Good food restaurants and shops with most necessities available.
ION Orchard,4,"Not bad... upscale shops, typical stuff... FREE WIFI; however, if you're in a hurry this place is like a maze... need to take your time with it!"
ION Orchard,3,"Seems to me the escalators are strategically placed to drive more traffic to shops. Escalators aren't placed at the same location each floor. Some escalators go up 2 floors. So a little bit of time wasting here. If you're keen to window shop brands, this is the place. But I'm more of a time guy. I dont like the idea of wasting my life away finding escalators. Hahahaha. Elevators are quite a walk away. Escalators are always the closest to you. Get it?

Pros: The Gucci employees welcome you even if you're in shorts and Tee. Surprising."
ION Orchard,5,Good fun
ION Orchard,5,The best place
ION Orchard,4,"Fancy mall. Nice and modern, but after a few malls on Orchard Rd, they all seem the same."

ION Orchard,4,Good shopping mall
ION Orchard,5,its a nice place were u can buy some stuff u liked the most
ION Orchard,3,Hi-end stores on the ground floor. Mid-range and others elsewhere. Long walks and a large number of outlets. They certainly need to do better with seating for elderly.

ION Orchard,1,"Hates to go there, it's too confusing.."
ION Orchard,4,"Among all the malls in Singapore, it has the most various choice on fashion and luxury goods in my view.
You can access to almost all the brands imported in Singapore.
The only cons is too much crowded esp. on weekends and public holidays."

ION Orchard,5,"My wife's favourite haunt. We do try to visit it every once in a while,  as it is one of the newest malls in Singapore.  Parking is expensive though. ( and just out of erp, which is good). All the high end luxury shops are there.  Has many basement levels,  with direct access to the met as well.  I particularly like the lowest basement door area. Besides the food court,  you get many I retesting snacks,  cakes,  chocolates etc from around the world. This,  you don't find in other malls in Singapore. Hope this helps."
ION Orchard,5,"Premium Mall
such a beauty!"
ION Orchard,5,This mall has it all - luxury to fast fashion and everything in between. Great food court in basement level.
ION Orchard,5,Always eat here.love it..
ION Orchard,3,"Modern, chic looking mall, but things here aren't exactly cheap because of the high rental costs."
ION Orchard,5,"Besides taking the advantage of its location (right above subway station), ION has all kinds of excellent brands settled in. The basement is where the desired but rare items are found, and the top floor of shopping is the perfect place for picking up presents. Dining options range from cozy food booths and cafes (mostly underground) to high-end eating houses (higher floors). So far, ION has become my most visited mall. Not to mention the place of residence on the top."
ION Orchard,5,Posh mall with world class brands. Love the fragrance they use as part of branding. The lower levels can get very crowded during peak hours. The higher floors esp L2 and L3 are calm and serene.
ION Orchard,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mall. Huge!!! And conveniently located at Orchard Road. The underpass allows you to go to the Orchard Road easily.
ION Orchard,5,"Gigantic mall featuring a wide variety of stores and restaurant, but mainly very high-end shops selling designer clothing & other top-of-the-line goods."
ION Orchard,4,Smells good...
ION Orchard,4,Situated just above the Orchard MRT station. It is one of the premier shopping CTR for high fashion goods..
ION Orchard,5,Best place
ION Orchard,4,"ION is beautiful, clean, but the shops might not be for everyone.

On the upper levels, the high end boutiques occupy them, whereas the lower levels are occupied by shops catering to the average consumer.

That being said, the structure itself is beautiful, and worth coming just to take photos."
ION Orchard,4,Good mix of shops. Very clean toilets. Easy access from mrt.
ION Orchard,5,It's amazing. Every building is connected. We can walk through the tunnels too. Navigation should be easy. It's difficult to find specific shops.
ION Orchard,1,"It's currently running a promotion for a $20 voucher for using MasterCard for purchases over a certain dollar amount, but in the fine print it excludes anyone residing in Singapore.  It seems almost like a scam to advertise this for all customers in ""Southeast Asia"" while excluding the locals from the country where the mall is located in (which is definitely in Southeast Asia).

It leaves a bad taste in one's mouth for a mall seemingly positioning itself to be on the higher end to exhibit rather shady behavior like this.  It's definitely not living up to the image it tries to project, as I see it."
ION Orchard,5,"Glamorous shopping centre in the heart of Singapore's shopping district (Orchard road). Has all of the luxury brands that you could ever want or dream of. For the more budget conscious shoppers, there are also more modest shops that cater to their wallets. There are also a wide variety of dining options available to satiate your hunger after a long shopping spree."
ION Orchard,5,Looking for branded items?   Then this is the place.  MRT is just at the basement.
ION Orchard,3,A gander
ION Orchard,5,"Best shopping mall in Singapore with all varieties of retails, salons etc."
ION Orchard,5,Easy to navigate around and lots of high end stores to choose from. Np big crowds too
ION Orchard,5,"I would count it among one of the best Malls in Singapore. Conveniently Located adjacent the the  MRT. Ambience is very pleasant and vibrant.
Wide variety of food available here to cater for locals and expatriates alike. Almost all luxury Brand’s available under one roof. Collection here is at a bit higher end. So if you have an appetite for designer merchandise, this is the right place for you."
ION Orchard,5,All high end brands under one roof. Many dining choices. Connected underground to the MRT and nearby malls and hotels. Very accessible
ION Orchard,3,"Such a beautiful mall. Not much shops missing here, with newest products coming here first because there are so many customers coming here. Good!"
ION Orchard,4,"Ion orchard is one of the most popular shopping mall in Singapore now a days. The mall is directly linked to orchard mrt station, making it very easy accessible. Moreover it is centrally located in the heart of the orchard shopping district, attracting large number of local and tourist from all across the world."
ION Orchard,3,For the shopping lovers with a good taste of quality and variety at competitive prices. Open till late and located just above a rail subway station making it easily accessible. Enjoy street light decorations and open air performances by various upcoming artist showcasing their works close by.
ION Orchard,5,Great
ION Orchard,5,"This mall is nice, exclusive with many international brand shops. I was there in a christmas season, there are so many entertainment on the street to entertain people who passing through the orchard street."
ION Orchard,5,"A good place to shop, and even better place to take photos on the outside"
ION Orchard,5,"Super crowded when i went yesterday, everyone was buying for Christmas gifts, i believe.."
ION Orchard,5,What a mall 😘😘😍😍😱😱
ION Orchard,5,Well connected to mrt
ION Orchard,5,"One of the trendiest places to visit, it is a very big shopping complex where you can find almost any brand which you are looking for. It also hold the ION sky, which offers a good panoramic view of Singapore and its neighbors. Friends and families can come her to eat, shop, or just enjoy themselves while escaping the heat or heavy downpour."
ION Orchard,5,"Lots of stores with name brands, plentiful restaurants, and easy access to the MRT to get around."
ION Orchard,5,What else you could ask from ION? They have everything. Don't missed to try 4fingers chicken at B4 level
ION Orchard,4,Air-conditioning too cold to stay for long.
ION Orchard,5,A shopping centre we found good. to visit
ION Orchard,5,"So many great shops, you will love it"
ION Orchard,4,"Such an enormous shopping centre, we passed through a few times and saw a different part each time. The food court downstairs is ok for a bite but expensive as expected for the area"
ION Orchard,5,"One of my favourite mall in orchard road singapore, a lot of shops and food tenant. also have underground link to other mall(s)."
ION Orchard,4,"High end underground super shopping centre in Singapore located at Orchard Road. It has MRT station within it. Very modern, contemporary & dazzling carrying renowned brand outlets of the world."
ION Orchard,5,Many many people even on a Monday night.
ION Orchard,5,"i enjoy this mall as the mix of shops is very interesting, with various price points."
ION Orchard,5,"Very nice mall, focusing on luxury and designer shops. However, they do have non-designer branded shops here too. Besides from shopping, there is also many places to buy food and drinks, a free art gallery, and complimentary tickets to the observation deck if you spend more than S$20. Free WiFi."
ION Orchard,5,"Beautiful mall,  most lavish I have visited.  It's missing the Porche and Lamborghini dealership on the third floor.  There is so much shopping it's overwhelming.  Top floor (L4) is the most lavish and expensive and it gets less expensive as one goes to the lower basement floor(B4).  Food court is on B4.  Sweet pool on the top floor!"
ION Orchard,4,"The kind of atas place rich people go to. Lovely for families who are looking for a dining place. Great for window shoppers. Fantastic top floor view. An overall fantastic place to spend your time indoors. At night, the view of orchard is truly splendid. The lights are incredible. If you have the time to spare, just walk around and soak up all that branded goods display and the aroma of fancy cuisines. Hope you enjoy your visit :)"
ION Orchard,5,I love everything here
ION Orchard,4,It's high end shopping mall. Major branded shops available here.
ION Orchard,5,Many shops and crowded peoples here.
ION Orchard,5,"ION Orchard is high-end luxury mall in heart of Orchard Road. With many high end shops such as Gucci, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent among others. This mall has man information desks with many food options including Dunkin' Donuts. It is usually packed with both locals and tourists. This mall is great for everyone."
ION Orchard,4,I feel like there's a million malls in Singapore like this. Air conditioning is great! There are a lot of stores and a lot of places to grab food.
ION Orchard,4,Nice place!
ION Orchard,5,"I've been to singapore many times and I like this mall so much. Easy transport access, a lot of shops you can choose from exclusive brands, clothes, beauty shops. I'm not sure about choices for dining."
ION Orchard,5,"Many well known big fashion brand, its located on top of the Orchard MRT station and also surrounded by other large shopping malls. During my stay November the christmas decoration is very nice, especially the light decoration at night time."
ION Orchard,5,"I like to orchard very good nice. I go to visit big orchard very good. How many time i go to orchard eat n shopping, movie🎬🎥 very good.
😀👍👌👋"
ION Orchard,4,Nice
ION Orchard,5,Top shopping mall on Singapore's Orchard Road. Very quiet today as the impact of the Chinese travel bans are taking it's toll.
ION Orchard,5,Very upmarket mall with high-end retailers and undoubtedly the best dim sum restaurant in Singapore
ION Orchard,4,Super mall with lots of brands. Quite premium with a Orchard MRT connected to it. Food downstairs is nice and there’s a Daiso here too.
ION Orchard,3,"Very nice, but a bit like any fashion mall. There are some special shops though that are a bit more unique, so the mall is well worth a visit."
ION Orchard,4,"Photos taken at Salt Grill & Sky Bar
Venue setup by Love Moments.
Wonderful place for fine dining with spectacular view of the city sky. Food is without a doubt the best this city has to offer, if you're willing to fork out a few more 'pennies'.

ION Mall, the grandest and most luxurious mall in Singapore, catering to the high end residents that live nearby and those who travel far and wide to the shopping heaven that is Singapore. Give in to the shoperholic in you and have the shopping experience that no one can top (besides Dubai, obviously)"
ION Orchard,5,Centrally located. Good connections to MRT and neighboring malls. Wide range of shops and eateries.
ION Orchard,4,It may be difficult to get around this place and find the outlet you're looking for here. It's also often crowded with many people as there are a very wide variety of shops here. There are many sports outlets and clothing stores but not as many food places. It would be nice to walk around this mall when you have time to spare.
ION Orchard,4,this is the fancy mall i guess?.. saw pretty long line outside the LV store
ION Orchard,4,Enjoy myself every time I come here. I always buy food from downstairs. Never fail to find something good.
ION Orchard,5,"Lots of shopping, probably my wife's favourite mall.."
ION Orchard,5,"Wide selection of high street and designer clothing. However, this is my favourite mall to look for snacks - from street snacks to luxurious snacks/pastries, and sometimes new, creative snacks."
ION Orchard,4,Great Christmas Decor. Unfortunately missed the Ion Sky view due to Versailles Art exhibition. Contains all the major international brands at a central location on Orchard Street. One of the must visit places.
ION Orchard,5,Went to Violet Oon Restaurant for dinner. Good food and good service. It is a pity not much crowd there. Economy very bad.
ION Orchard,4,"A fabulous place to shop, particularly for designer products. Bring your credit card as there are no limits for spending."
ION Orchard,5,Polite security staff who responded when greeted.Not very nice sales people from some boutiques.
ION Orchard,4,"Nice selection of brands available from top tier to mid-level brands. Also have a wide array of food to choose from however, it gets too crowded during lunch & dinner hours. The mall would have been a complete shopping destination if they've got a grocery/supermarket inside or attached to it."
ION Orchard,5,"Lovely place, beautiful site"
ION Orchard,3,nice place
ION Orchard,5,There many boutique shops around. Most of all the public toilet is the cleanest in town and with elegant furnishings
ION Orchard,5,Many shops with good food options. Accessible by mrt
ION Orchard,5,orchard road
ION Orchard,4,Very crowded place
ION Orchard,5,"Great shopping, window or real. High end gear. Great to watch people in general"
ION Orchard,5,Extensive list of retail stores inside with luxury and high end stores. Very clean and not too busy. Got most of my needs here whenever I visit Singapore.
ION Orchard,4,"Well connected to the orchard MRT station. Lots of shops and eateries. There is the ion sky ,which is a viewing deck, for entry to shoppers who buy $20 and above of items. Just need to produce the receipt.  Not sure if they have changed the policy?  Can ask the helpful concierge there 😉"
ION Orchard,3,Central shopping hub in Singapore. Eateries and branded goods available. Train station is conveniently near the mall.
ION Orchard,5,"This place makes me feel like I am rich. Hahaha. Great range of stores at a range of prices. You'll never be bored here, and the variety of stores is always changing. Great place for shopping and food."
ION Orchard,5,Good and luxury place to go shopping. But the food is good
ION Orchard,5,The mall is huge and you can get lost here.. but the vibe here is very good. The place bustles. You can find anything that you are looking for. And lots of eating places. Upmarket restaurants also
ION Orchard,5,There were a range of shops present
ION Orchard,5,Awesome place.....loved every moment i spent there.....good for shopping and eateries
ION Orchard,5,A place for shopping and eating.
ION Orchard,5,"The most incredible mall, particularly for high-end shopping."
ION Orchard,5,So awesome
ION Orchard,4,"Located at the heart of Orchard Road, Ion Orchard is probably the most premier shopping mall in Singapore offering a wide variety of retail brands and dining experiences."
ION Orchard,5,"This is one places I feel is like a hidden gem, because I was not expecting to find a food court so exciting, but it's definitely worth checking out if you like trying food.  It also has the ion sky tower access. If you purchase more than $20SGD (for each ticket and you can combine receipts), you can get into the sky tower which has a 45min. show periodically. Once into the elevator it whisks you up in no time to floor 55. From there, you'll be able to see an almost 360 degree view of the Singapore skyline.

Now you may think you may not want to pay $20 to see a skyline, that may be true, but the secret is it's not too hard to spend $20 on food, and that's where the secret is.  You don't have to go to the pricey stores, though, it's probably not too hard to spend that much there either. Just buy small things here and there and go visit the food floor and there will be a whole assortment of Asian food types.  I ended up eating at an Indonesian restaurant, picked up coffee somewhere else and dessert and we hit the mark. I went with my girlfriend, so that meant we needed to spend $40 but works out the same.

The shopping is pretty much your standard upscale stores mixed in with some other smaller stores, it's fairly large though, so I didn't go through the whole place, wasn't there for shopping.

If you don't go there for the sky tower, I would definitely check out the food court and restaurants. As a foreigner, it probably interests me more than the locals, but if you like Asian food, it's worth seeing all the different foods."
ION Orchard,5,"If you looking for branded stuff, here is the very awesome shopping centre."
ION Orchard,5,"Handy to MRT which will be the least costly part of the whole overwhelming experience
The pianist at the Steinway piano outlet provides the music of the sound system. Just to give you an idea of the OTT names of the shops. Take a well endowed credit card."
ION Orchard,5,"Great shopping place, most branded stuff can be found here. Good for tourists who want to shop."
ION Orchard,5,No comment
ION Orchard,5,All under 1 roof. Anything from head to toe. You able get from this mall
ION Orchard,3,The place is quite fancy but it was hard to find halal food inside the shopping mall. We only found one stall of food in the shopping mall but it turned to be incredible experience. The food was extremely good!!
ION Orchard,5,Location of many international brands and is easily accessible as it is directly connected to Orchard MRT station. Tons of good food can be found from the wide variety of restaurants and eateries located in the mall.
ION Orchard,4,I have been here it’s so organized mall in orchard road and Fitness First is here also.
ION Orchard,5,Modern mall with many international brands.
ION Orchard,5,Awesome premium shopping experience and top quality restaurants. Gets extremely crowded during peak hours.
ION Orchard,4,Food plenty n shops around . Convenient spot with mrt. Prices of food need to be reduce by 15%
ION Orchard,5,"One of the hundreds shopping malls in Singapore, clean save air-conditioned, lot of lady's shop and a nice food court. You find any kind of food. But not much Men's Shops at all. But worth to visit. Don't get lost in the lower flower because they are connected with the strett underpass. Rember the #of the entrance you used."
ION Orchard,5,Love
ION Orchard,4,Located in Orchard road. Mall is awesome but it’s pricy. If you are looking cheaper price then takeout malls located in Orchard area from your list.
ION Orchard,3,"Generally a great shopping mall that cater for mid to high price range fashion and accessories.
Also offer variety of food from food court to high end restaurant.
Good place to go"
ION Orchard,3,"Been almost close to a year since going to Orchard Ion cause it's always crowded. Two words, still crowded!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice trek to have a piece of nature. Free to enter and not too crowded.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good hiking spot with different routes level to choose. Well shaded by the canopy inside the trail. A great way to get in some fresh air while enjoying the tranquility of nature.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,The nature here is better. More fresh air.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A perfect weekend to spend in the wilderness... being amidst nature is the best feeling . One is never alone,  one can use that time to rejuvenate,  introspect, appreciate and above all getting here is only a 15 minute drive or 25 min public transport journey from any part of the city ."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"You can choose between the paved and elevated trail or the undulating rocky and muddy trail. Either way the experience for the senses of a tropical forest is simply amazing. Well put together and fabulous..even on a scorching day, it is cool as you are covered by tree canopies. And all this practically within miles of the city, without the sounds and completely immersed in nature. Worthy of a visit. Plan your trek as there are a number of trails."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"The Macritchie Treetop Walk is a suspension bridge that allows a hiker to walk through the treetops of the forest. It is some distance from the nearest carpark but worth a try, especially for kids who will be thrilled walking above the trees. Do note that the walk is one-way only, so follow the instructions and do not try to enter from the back."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice top of the world experience.  But for seniors the one way walk back is quite long . 1.5 hours slow walk.  Maybe can make an alternative shorter route back.  Suggestion
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"To avoid the heat, Dawn is the best time to sightsee. Albeit if one hiked the jungle trail they will mostly be protected by the trees. If one loved nature, this is a must visit with plenty of wild animals to scrutinize. Especially monkeys, do keep your foods and drinks hidden as the monkeys are great hunters amongst these areas. My friends and I have personally experienced their aggressiveness. Additionally, protect your phone. As long as the hands are empty, one is generally safe. Spray lots of insect repellents and enjoy the views!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Fantastic place for an outing with friends. Longs walks and meaningless talks. Just perfect. Do check out all the routes, esp the jelutong tower and tree top walk. The McRitchie nature trail is kind of its own. Do take note the tree top walk is closed on Mondays."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Can trek any time of the day unless when it rains. The tracks are mostly covered with tall trees. Little sunlight penetrates. You will not feel extreme hot but you will still need water as there are quite a lot of up slopes and stairs.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Love the walk from Venus Drive car park (also the shortest route at 2.5km one way, total route about 6km). Go early to avoid the heat. The ranger station is where you can fill up on water and check out macaque monkeys (but watch out if you’re carrying food visibly or in plastic bags)!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"A place far from the city life, made me remember the countryside in India. A different feel, monkeys, snakes, squirrels and monitor lizards."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great place to walk!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,This is a beautiful and free walk through the forest. You have to go if you visit Singapore and enjoy exercise and walking in nature. Bring water and wear comfortable exercise clothes.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Enjoyable and pleasant walk through
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,"A great forest or place to walk. After journeying to the treetop, it is rather  a small hill or forest despite the whole place being 10km distance to and fro in total. Its a great change of pace and perhaps a small escape from the busy city life. I think this would also be a good spot for a date walk."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Enjoyed trekking with a friend. We completed our journey in 2.5 hours starting from Venus car park to treetop walk and back. Loved every moment of this walk.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Monkeys are so cute! But pls don’t bring any plastics bags otherwise they will rob you....
There is a water refill station provided."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Excellent nature walk with many animals to spot along the way, Monkeys, fishes, squirrels, dragonflies, plants of all shapes and sizes. O some times snake can be spotted too. Bring some water and light clothings. Don't wear your high heels here, the walk is very uneven and make cause sprain ankles."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good place
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Lovely routes to hike (or run if you're brave), just don't expect to get around in jeans and flip flops , even the Venus car park to tree top loop is close to 8km, be prepared that it's rocky and steep in places and that children will struggle, heaven help those who turn up with kids with scooters, I hope you enjoy carrying everything a long way"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Lovely place to trek and relax
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Had peaceful walk all the way to tree top walk. You feel nearer to the nature when you get to walk in the forest. I have encountered three wild boars, two squirrels, many monkeys(>10) and a lizard. Make sure you bring a water bottle, mosquito repellent, wear long pants, shoes and some snacks or energy bar because you’ll need to spend at least 3-4 hours  until you get out. Everything is maintained nicely especially the footpath, recommended for nature lovers."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"1. Be prepared with umbrella, water bottle and a light snack.
2. Know your limits. Don't push beyond your limits.
3. Take tons of pictures for the beautiful memories ahead.
4. Enjoy!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Jungle in the city. Amazing walk and hike up. Very well paved pathway and informative points along the route.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Well maintained trail, lovely bridge and lots of stairs up and down. Regular resting spots, bring a bottle of water."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,We had a really  good walk everytime  we go there cooling shady and nice place  to walk.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,One of the best hikes I have ever done. Go with your loved ones. Carry lot of water and just enjoy.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"This was a great view and a relaxing way to spend a morning after a late night. We enjoyed the views and getting outside for some movement. We did not realize that it was a 4 mile walk round trip. Had we known it was that long we would have worn better shoes. Besides the slightly longer than expected walk, it was wonderful!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great walk with nature. Fresh air with Clean environment. Conserved well by the authorities. Great to see natural beauty
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"We elected to go for the orange route - est. 7km. The walk itself is challenging in parts, especially along the more natural trails however for the most part it is boardwalk. The climax of the walk is the treetop bridge. Spectacular views with information along the bridge included. The monkeys can be cheeky so best not to take plastic bags in plain site as they will be snatched! Be confident and they will not bother you however. Would highly recommend."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Surprising place that singapore has maintained the nature so well in the small city. Can have a good run, outing , nature walk. Bit far to walk with kids and elderly."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Wonderful place ..
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Used this walk to access the Tree Top Walk (which is closed on Mondays). The signage is excellent, ways are in great shape and there's lots of shade. Saw quite a few animals like lizards, squirrels, butterflies and dragonflies. There's a toilet and a car park at the beginning of the walk."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,What a great get away bang in the middle of the city. If you're looking to do something away from the hustle bustle of the city then definitely  head here.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Such a lovely place for run and jog. The tree top walk is a one way trip, and it’s quite a very long one. There is Cisco Officer there ensure you are not turning back. Do make sure you really wanna Walk that much before you decided to take that walk."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"I'm so glad we made it! If you go with kids who may not be up for the long hike to get there, park at the Venus carpark, which is the closest you'll get to the Treetop walk. We saw lots of monkeys and really enjoyed the hike. Before the treetop portion there is a ranger station with bathrooms and water fountain,  which we all appreciated!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Fantastic place but carry water with you and you have to walk around 6kms up and down
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Do go in the morning and do not put food or fruits in a hand carry plastic bag as high chance that it will attract monkeys. Monkey attempted to snatch my backpack although there was absolutely no food inside, just bottle water. Just heed these advise, and you will enjoy the 7km nice walk, with a view like in the photo. That will take 1.5hours to 2hours."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,It was an amazing place for those who love hiking
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A good place to bring whole family for a good time outdoors. Nice view on top of the bridge too. Be sure to lookout for your footing, snakes and macaques."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,This park is one of the best in Singapore. The trails are easy and pleasant. Unfortunately the Tree Top is closed for maintenance
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"An incredible spot, just a few minutes away from wherever you are in Singapore. Brilliant trails from the reservoir all the way around. Great place to see lots of wildlife. We will definitely be back !!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Experience was good with the trekking group. Although the place is not breathtaking but not bad also. You can go for a trekking trip with friends and groups.

Here the trails are flat , So you will not able to enjoy the actual rough road trails experience. mostly its like walking only. I feel like its good for jogging and running."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice place to re charge
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Beautiful place to walk and run. Sites seeing is amassing
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Nice walk from
601 Rifle Range Rd, Singapore, 588398
to the pickup point at
30 Venus Dr, Singapore, 573858
Did the Jelutong Tower first and then the Tree Top Trail.
Saw monkeys and a lizard"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Excellent place to escape the city (though it's usually busy with joggers and walkers).
Surprisingly good hikes for Singapore, and everything is clearly signposted.
On my various walks here I have seen snakes, wild boars and long-tailed macaques... It's wilder than a midnight stroll through Geylang! 😉"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,An amazing experience and a great simple walk of a couple of hours
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A very interesting nature trail for hiking. Not many up and down, but the whole trail will take you almost two (2) hours. Starting from the carpark (free), you the trail on the right side that at some part, it is beside the road the the Island Country Club. You will pass the water treatment plant before you reach the Ranger Station. Proceed further, you will walk across the Treetop suspended pedestrain bridge (one way). Very natural and good place for some sweating."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Very good, suitable for whole family. With many wild animal around the trial. You can walk to Bukit Timah natural park from there"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Nice comfortable trail. Bridge is narrow, and tends to get crowded. Beware of monkeys, don't let them see your food because they will attempt to take it."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Wonderful nature. So green so happy.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Had a great morning hike here.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,2,Very short .....well...um.... Singapore quiet small
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,The tree top walk is part of the nature reserve that connects Macritchie reservoir to the bukit timah forest reserve. There are many routes you can choose. From 1 to 4 hours hike. The highlight is the tree top walk build high above the trees. It's an enjoyable walk with plenty of rain forest trees providing necessary shelter.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"I assembled my 15 local and international friends at 2.30pm in Ang Mo Kio Hub (3 mins walk from train station so everyone living all over Singapore can meet), bought snacks and drinks, before taking Bus 166 from the bus interchange, 20 minutes straight to flame park bus stop, opposite of Venus Drive (entrance to treetop walk).

MacRitchie has many entrance, but since our main aim is the Treetop walk which closes at 5pm, Venus drive entrance is the closest to that path without us having to walk around the reservoir. We took a quick 1.5 hour stroll up and down and up and down the forest to reach the Treetop woohoo. Weather forecast said it was going to rain but it was sunny. We came prepared anyway.

Treetop... you stand above trees. Its a tiring but relaxing hike actually, had a great time doing something sweaty with friends. After the bridge it was mostly downhill, you must go to the 7 storey Jelutong Tower (30 mins walk away). Some visitors missed it. Its a tower where u can also stand above the trees for as long as you want and take a 360 degree video. Previously there was no crowd, so it can be a romantic place. But this saturday there are some joggers running around.

Lastly its a 40 mins straighforward walk out of the forest, the sunset made our group photos looked beautiful, we cleaned up till pass 6pm and took a bus ride to our indian cuisine dinner place along upper thomson road. 😊

Ps. There are monkeys along the way haha. And i took some videos but how do I upload here? 😅"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded! Getting up there was a fun challenge! The view is pretty lovely, but you won't be able to stop very long for photos if there happens to be a line of people behind you. One way only."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Amazing nature and easy track!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,great place for outdoor lover. love it and enjoy the track .
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Beautiful and a lot more difficult than my husband and I were prepared for. My legs were shaking so bad 😅 We hiked the treetop walk, which was about 4 miles roundtrip (starting at the parking lot). If you forget to bring water, there are fountains at the ranger station. There are also little areas along the walk to rest or have a snack (which the monkeys might try to steal). Highly recommend!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Awesome experiences for families, a walk in the nature full of life. Snakes, Giant Millipedes, Monkeys, Roosters, Squirrels and more."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Very good place for trial runner, family and individual trekking."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"What was intended as a quick jaunt up to the treetop walk turned into a 10-mile hike in 150% humidity. Not for the faint of heart, though at least a hundred people managed to jet by us--running, mind you--up the steadily inclining, rocky, often muddy terrain. It was intense. If your body is well-conditioned, go for it...but make sure you have a sense of how long your path is...because once you make it up to the treetop walk, it's ONE WAY ONLY. No turning back. Oh, and if monkeys staring you down from 1 foot away, lining the treetop walk ropes, make you squeamish...again, turn back before the treetop walk. Still, it was a colossal achievement and the nature was well worth the view."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Enjoyable walk, but not for those who are infirm or unfit"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A great place to connect with nature in Singapore. Nice trails and views.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Awesome place for a good walk or a run..
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Just found out about this park. Today's walk was short but it still took us an hr from carpark n back  will explore more .More Interesting than Thomson Nature reserve.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"3rd time here within 2 years.
TreeTop walk from Venus Drive from 745am till abt 1030am on a Sunday.

Human traffic up the TreeTop trail was moderate. But when returning back to Venus Drive, got a little more crowded.

Overall good trail. Recommended trail shoes if taking e route after raining as it get muddy and slippery. If you have bad ankle/knees, would help with hiking poles to aid when walking."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great place for hiking n relaxing. Stay away from modern city.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,You can choose different trails with varying difficulty levels depending on your craving for a workout. This is also a good trail for just a walk through woods. I think its better to go there when its dry as there are few places that you have to walk on swamp and I also happen to find lot of 🦎 and 🐍 near the trail when its wet. But this is a totally safe trail to trek. Make sure you carry in only a light bag and a very small water bottle. There is a place half way up the trail that you can fill up the bottle with drinking water if you happen to finish too soon.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Amazing walk through the rainforest. Make sure to pack lots of water for your trip :)
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Awesome streaks of light through the vegatation....nature at its best.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Actualize your potential

Say, you have all along a gift, a talent or an ability in communication. All you wish to know is how to get a confirmation that you have this innate gift and actualize it for your own development and growth as a human being. I will use my own experience with heroic quest to let you know how I get my confirmation and actualize it.

The road to actualize your potential is when you answer to the call to adventure. The call to adventure is a sacred call from life itself to remind you that there is a gift hidden inside you. And you have to use it for your development as a human being. You might have ignored it or not even aware of it. The call could be anything. It could be a wake-up call in the form of midlife crisis, reminding you to take responsibility of your life. This is exactly what has happened to me when I encounter a midlife crisis where I find my life is meaningless and my career is in the rut over three decades of my working life.

What I do next is, to answer to the call to adventure, I take the road less traveled rather than follow the flock to embark on an inner journey of heroic quest to find out what my life destiny is in this existence. In this unconventional approach, I seek the help of a deck of Crystal Ally Cards as my spiritual guide and the support and protection from the friendly Universe and light beings from the mineral kingdom. Within three months of my journey, I manage to find out from my spiritual guide that my life destiny is in writing. This is how I get my confirmation that I have a gift in writing and that my life destiny is in writing. Taking the cue from my spiritual guide that my life is in writing, I take the plunge to write my memoir on heroic quest over a period of fourteen years.

In chapter 5 of my book, Going Home, and under the caption, ‘The Challenges in writing’ I relate, “Upon deep reflection, my overall comment about writing my story is that it is indeed a very challenging, anguishing, and grueling task that spreads across a period of fourteen years. Ironically it is precisely because of these daunting challenges in the writing that I am unconsciously and consciously forced to bring out all the positive attributes in me to overcome the challenges one by one and eventually becoming a transformed person.” What I am saying in this paragraph is that it is through fulfilling my life destiny in writing over a period of fourteen years that I am able to develop my innate creative potential to the fullest to accomplishing writing a piece of work on heroic quest: that is to say that I am able to actualize my innate creative potential to become an author to a book, Going Home, on heroic quest."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Beautiful jungle, monkeys, views. Free!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"In a busy city like Singapore, it’s not easy to stay in touch with nature and this walk is one of the great ways you can do that. The shortest way to hike to the treetop walk is to enter via Venus Drive (still takes about 1.5-2 hours depending on your foot speed). Make sure you plan your way to get to the ranger station before 4pm as the walk will be closed at 4:30. This is a great weekend activity for all. You’ll meet some monkeys and interesting things of nature along the way :)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Awesome trail. I had so much fun trekking with friends.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Hike in tropical climate. Make sure you hydrate well. The hike is most fulfilling when you take the full route around macritchie reservoir. Preference is an evening morning (730am) start due to Singapore heat.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Comfortable hike, best if not in the middle of the day when it’s really hot"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Amazing trail
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice long walk but consists of many steps so families with strollers may find it a bit of a challenge.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"This is a great place for nature lovers and best nature reserve in Singapore, good for hiking, running."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"The Treetop walk was thrilling with a beautiful view. The hike to and fro was manageable. Do spray on some insect repellent, I didn't realize I had bites until I came back."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"What an awesome way to sweat it out in the city.
Awesome views.
It's one way only so no turning back.
Do not keep open food, monkeys around."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,I come here semi regularly and its a great place to take hikes and enjoy nature but pls note that the bridge itself is closed during this covid period
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,It was really very good trip.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Lots of wildlife.

Beware. Quite a distance to walk from macritchie reservoir and lots of stairs to climb!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great place for birding and photography. Well maintained. Beautiful trials.. But no nearby MRT stations available to the actual tree top..  If you start walking from Caldecott MRT it's a long way to tree top. From MRT take a taxi to Venus drive parking lot and from there it's 2kms to the tree top walk. Have a great time!!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Seems like under maintenance till 31 May 2021.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice walk.  Lots of stairs both up and down after the treetops.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good place for walk and track
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,7km route suitable for young and old
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"How to spend 2 hours walking in the woods with fresh air, AWAY from all electronics (the signal was weak here). This is the place."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good place for hiking💪
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Well maintained and safe !
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Love the trails here, good place to take a walk, very refreshing and cool"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice place to spend your weekend. But be ready for the long trails.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Treetop walk is closed..but loved the trek even without that..along the reservoir edge..on the board walk.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great adventure for a Saturday morning!
Feels very refreshed mental when being with the nature"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Long walks (trails) but enjoyable
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"A good place to start in the walk to the Treetop Walk Trail, convenient car park located. Often visited by nature photographers."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"I've always enjoyed nature. And Macritchie is truly one of the best location to experience Mother Nature. I used to compete in runs during my schooling days and have grown very accustomed to the terrain here.
I have been bringing the kids here for their hikes, I make it a point to let them experience nature every month.
The decent canopy allows for a good shady hike through the forestation and once in awhile, you get to experience the wild animals and insects."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,One of the highlights of the central catchment area. The hike there does. It prepare you for the suspension bridge which spans 250m across a valley and overlooking the upper Pierce Reservoir in the distance. The bridge is one-way traffic and the round trip from Venus Drive is about 7km. Do check the opening hours to avoid disappointmrnt.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great park! Lovely place to walk after the afternoon rains are over.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"I like the walk into nature. If you like to embrace yourself into nature and don't mind your shoes get dirty,  you will like this place."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Awesome place but let down by inconsiderate people who littered the reserve.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Meeting in the wild, focus and talk to the trees, wild boar, roaster, fishes,  squirrel and birds. Leave some blood for the insects and perspiration for the mangrove swamp. Be good."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Extremely good and rather scary at first! Lots of nature to see on the bridge.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Listen to the beautiful music of nature as you walk through the Macritchie and be amazed by how calming the effect it'll be to your mind..
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Quiet and beautiful. So worth the trip.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,Nice trail. Way to walk. Lots of wild life.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"We went there on National day and had to queue 30min to get on the bridge! However the view from the bridge was stunning. Arrive there before 10am or it's going to get super hot and humid, arm yourself with mosquito repellent too. There's also a water cooler at the ranger station. The whole circuit from venus carpark takes ~1.5hrs"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,One of the best trekking routes in singapore. The treetop walk bridge is currently closed until May 2021
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Love walking here!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,a lot of walk to reach this place. carry water. the kilometers written in the display board is deceptive as i walked a lot and realized it just few meters. good for visiting one but never again.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,The trail is interesting. But the tree top walk is closed for upgrading from 11 Aug 2020 to May 2021. Will back again after the upgrade is done.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good place in Singapore to explore nature
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Full greenery and good place to visit
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great walk. Wobbly legs at treetop walk for those who fear height
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Good for hiking on foot running through trail on wooden 'pavements'
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good place to start a hike. Carpark and toilet facilities.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"One of the best place (5/5) in Singapore for morning exercise.
From this point, you need to walk about 1.5 km to reach the TreeTop Walk Suspension Bridge."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice trail for nature lovers.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great trek with a great view. There's a variety of trails and I'll definitely come back to try them all.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Guyz, Nice please to hike and walk besides tree top walk (the bridge) under maintenance, will open on mid of 2021"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Dont forget to bring your umbrella and insect repellent
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great way to spend a day with nature. The access to the reservoir and the tree top walk are different, and becomes extremely long if you cross the reservoir to reach the trail"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Not at long as I thought it would be, but still a nice walk through the trees. I walked probably 10km of the trails in the area of the treetop walk and it was beautiful, especially around the reservoir. Nice afternoon/evening activity. Trails are mostly shaded by trees to keep out of the hot sun. Its a wonderful peice of nature to step out of the beautiful futuristic city for a few hours."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A good place for a simple trek..
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,One of the best part to trek
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Only if u love nature...currently tree top is closed due to some service works..
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A great walking trail and a good level for runners... if you are a tourist or first time visitor, the ideal time is to start 7 am and the entry through Windsor park is more convenient."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,It's really an ideally place for trekking
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Going there and doing a the small tour will take you 2 hours at a normal speed. I went there on a Saturday morning and was surprised -in a good way- because there was not that much people. The bridge is quite impressive and very high, so it might be difficult for kids or people who fear heights to pass it. Also, beware of the monkeys on the path. Overall, it's a lovely way to spend time."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice trail but is closed from Aug 2020 for maintenance....
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"It's a good place to do a trek and great experience walking on the tree top walk. Not for the weak hearts who are frightened of heights 😂
Overall it's a great experience to have fun with friends. 👍👍"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice durian fragrance as you walk Venus Drive path.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Looking forward to this reopening again...
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Fresh air with beautifil scenery and many different creatures to be seen (  especially monkeys ! )
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Wonderful views, some serious stairs involved so have good shoes, be in good condition and bring some water to drink. You will be up close with many monkeys, opportunities for great pictures!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice place for family
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"You may need to wait a few more months for the treetop walk, it is under maintenance until May 2021 or so."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,A beautiful park near my place. Me and my family will usually start the walk from the reservoir to the tree top walk on a weekend morning. The whole journey took about 1 hours up and 2 hours down by the golf course. A great place to do bird seeing and getting close to nature.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Nice place ever...
Good for hiking
Nice river view"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"*Note this Rating is for Hanguana Trial and Venus Loop.

We attempted to go the Treetop Walk. But we tried to take a Grab to Google Maps marked point for the Treetop Walk. It actually leads you through a private country club which you cannot get through. There is a parking lot at the base of all the trials that acts as a starting point. Otherwise, trail with interesting sights and sounds"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Unique hiking experience as the Macritchie Reservoir.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great experience, definitely worth giving a try when in Singapore. On my way to the bridge I encountered some monkeys in my way which made me little anxious but anyway enjoyed the walk a lot. Very calming and relaxing(once you walk past monkey family)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Away from the city life
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,"Treetop is closed for refurbishment?
Anyway, I do my walk on a regular basis about 3 times/week."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great morning spent walking the 7km loop from Venus carpark. We saw macaques,  colugo, lizards and many butterflies. Enjoyed watching macaque attempt to steal glasses off a man. Lodge keeper just watched the interaction on standby, but he helps if you request assistance. He has a stick to chase the monkeys away. (He is a spurs fan.)

Recommend wearing trainers; lots of steps to go up and down which can be slippy if wet. Go early if you can. Insect repellent may also be good. And DO NOT FEED THE MONKEYS! They are wild animals :)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Exhausting but great way to workout.wesr lightweight material due to sunny weather in singapore.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A well designed trail to allow an appreciation of the nature reserve and rainforest.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,It’s a great hike and takes roughly about two hours. It’s a fairly easy hike as well as mos tot the trails are well marked and in certain areas has wooden steps.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A walk in the nature
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Beautifull
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Favourite hiking area
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Lovely place to go to in singapore
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,The faster entry and exit point to and fro TreeTop walk!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Easy trail, complete within own time own target. Enjoy the melodious sounds from the birds🐥🐦 Bring water to hydrate and some snacks that can easily pop into your mouth, as the macaques are lurking around with laser sharp eyes🐒"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A great place to walk in lush greenery. It’s a jungle in the middle of a highly developed and bustling city.
Very clean, well maintained and biggest park in Singapore."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,HOT. but a nice walk. MONKEYS!!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Good exercise location
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,It was a great experience for people who wants to hike during their free time😂.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great place to trek alone or with friends.

Highly recommend proper shoes for this one. The trail is of similar terrain to Bukit Timah hill.

Toilets and water coolers available at the start and also different check points in the trail.

Advisable not to bring fresh food in as there are monkeys around who are not afraid to be close to humans.

Enjoy! :)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice walking trail for young and old.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Trails leading to the Tree Top Walk via Windsor Natures Park were good and clean. It was a good walk. You can see squirrels, wild boars, beautiful looking birds, etc. We completed about 3 hours to and fro."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great place for hiking
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,250m bridge is nice.  Trip to reach tree top walk require stamina
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,It is currently closed for improvement works.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,It's quite a walk to actually get to the tree top area. So make sure to wear walking shoes and bring plenty of water. Got quite a few mosquito bites so don't forget the bug spray. You will be able to see loads of squirrels and monkeys on the way.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,This HSDC Treetop Walk park trail opens at 9am to 5pm on weekdays & 8:30 am - 5pm on weekends. But closed on every Monday unless it's a holiday. Total 250m long of Suspended bridge with only one direction flow. Here you can enjoy the hiking trails interactive with some small animals. But dogs are not allowed enter to park.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Good trekking place. Away from all the noise. Best route - start from Macritchie main entrance and do the full circuit via golf course. Total distance 11km
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Amazing walk on the only such bridge in Singapore, with a view of the forest and the MacRitchie Reservoir. Worth the walk through the park. Lovely bit of nature tucked into the city."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great views of the forest.
You might encounter wild monkeys on the bridge so be sure not let any food exposed on you as they might try to grab it."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,1,Tree top walk closed google no update
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Good walk, clear signs where to go. Take your time and bring some water with you!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,A tiring but interesting experience
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Located in the central catchment nature reserve, Macritchie treetop walk offers stunning views of Singapore's remaining primary forests and secondary forests. It's probably the only place you can see such a vast spread of green. Try to avoid the weekends, however, because it gets crowded then and you'll have to rush through the walk (which is one-way)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice place for the spending time. Not much to see in the place but its peaceful. Bring some stuff to eat as there is nothing to eat in the park
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,The monkeys are not aggressive. Overall it was an easy walk but still nice enough to make you break a sweat.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,Tree Top's is closed for upgrading.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,I would love to come back to enjoy the view and air the photo that is shown is all the actual thing! Highly recommended!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Nice hike/walk but there were few 'great views'
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,The actual interesting part of the treetop walk is the walk there from Windsor nature park. Windsor nature park used to be an old kampong so you can still see plants people planted from long ago and some old concrete steps. You can also see yam plants and banana trees that were left behind
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Long walk to treetop
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Not for people with a fear of heights. It is fascinating to walk above the canopy. I guess makes for very good selfies as well. Beware the monkeys though they are not a pleasant company.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,nice first class
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,The monkeys are everywhere
MacRitchie Nature Trail,2,"very easy walk - wouldn't call it a hike. some steps, nothing too steep. the suspension bridge is a disappointment and that's pretty much the only point you'll see something else than tree trunks and leaves."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice trekking trail not much upward slopes. Terrain is uneven but overall an easy trek route. Good for beginners to start with. There are monkeys so don't try to feed them and careful of your belongings.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"A very nice and enjoyable tracking location.  Mostly sheltered. However do watch out for the monkeys as they can come alongside quite close.  Be careful if have kids around, don't snack in front of the monkeys as they can be aggressive and snatch yr food..."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great day out, nice walk, nice views, monkeys weren't too troublesome"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Beautiful paths , photo worthy walkway, clean and well maintained, less crowded place.  Must consider place in the Singapore tour itenerary."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Love this place. Went with my friends and had lots of fun. We saw a lot of interesting animals and insects. Unfortunately, the alarm went off when we were still on the treetop trail and it started raining on our way down. We were all drenched. Be sure to check the weather forecast before going!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Absolutely breathtaking views of plants and vegetation from a descent altitude walking over a narrow suspension bridge.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Quite a long jungle walk to get to the tree top walk with chance to see animals (we saw monkeys, flying squirrel). There are a couple of toilets and water refill points along the way. You can get stuck behind a school trip which can be a bit annoying but they generally let you past if you're walking quick enough. The bridge itself is cool but I would take the whole round-trip walk as the event rather than just the tree-top part as this is only a small part of the experience."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Several routes to choose depends on your choice on the distance and duration.
Will see squirrels,  monkeys occasionally. Good place to walk and enjoy the nature when you want to take a break from city environment."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Great place for a short trail. Loved seeing the monkeys.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,fun hike
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Really good views of Upper Peirce Reservoir, tree canopies and valley. It's a one way system so the route is somewhat longer. The return journey has plenty of steps."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Awesome place for trail hiking.
Don't bring food along the trail or the monkey will come after you.
Tree Top trail closes by 4.45pm"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Nice view, really so beautiful.
It's quite fun, don't think you alone there, when you reach there, you will meet a lot of people."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Calm monkeys
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"One of the best hidden gems in SG for those who love trail walking. For a city gal like me, the trek was an adventure with frequent sightings of monkeys, squirrels, wild fowls. Loved the treetop walk the most, though the suspension bridge can be abit scary. Bring along a poncho in case it rains while in the middle of the trek. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do :-)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Love the greens and quietness of nature.

Parents with children may want them to be considerate of others by keeping their volume down"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"This is a great set of trails. Unfortunately we did not realize how extensive they were before going or we would have allocated much more time. We had only an hour or so to spend and we did walk a bit of the trails, but would have liked to do much more. The trails were nice and easy to follow. It is very peaceful here and easy to get transportation. There is even a mall nearby with a food court to get some refreshments. I would certainly recommend going, but would suggest going in the morning and allocating several hours for the trails here."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,4-5 hours of walking trail. Good place for weekend joggers. The entire trail is covered with trees so don’t worry about midday sun. Carry water bottles. Treetop walk isn’t that great as expected. But worth a try.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"As a person who loves to hike, this is a must place to go to for people who loves to hike or people who just enjoys the beauty of nature. There are lot of 🐒 there, so be sure to not bring any food there. :)"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,nice concept but seems too short for me. need to travel about 3km before you reach there. so be prepared.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great hike through tropical rainforest. View from the top is so worth it. Those with knee problems may find the many steps after crossing the bridge a real challenge.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"It's actually about 5km here.. and another 5km back to entrance :)

Read the signage and don't get lost. The way to the tree top walk is confusing when reaching the large tar road. Trust the signage.

Don't bring food if possible, because there are monkeys waiting to take from you. But if you need to eat, look around first before opening. Especially when you are at the ranger station..

I saw some monkey having love time. So yep."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,The hike is not difficult. Nice shady paths so not too hot.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Awesome Trail
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Well worth the long walk. Bring lots of water as there aren’t any stations in between
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Well maintained track, nice escape from the city for abit of nature walk. Avoid going during peak crowded times though."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,This is one of the recommended place if you wish to enjoy the scenery at the same time walk the trail for a small exercise to escape the busy and hectic life for a breather.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Good for walking through the nature with a little level of difficulty. Do it at your own pace. Have fun.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,"Treetop Walk Is Under Maintenance.So, It Is Temporarily Closed."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A place where you can forget that you are in Singapore, except for the hot humid weather, or when you bump into some other annoying visitors.  Good view and well maintained track.  Can see monitor lizard, birds, insects and monkeysss along the track."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,I would normally park my car at Venus Dr carpark and entered through the Windsor Park. This is because the parking is free. Hehehe.. ✌️. From here I have the choice of going to the Tree Top Walk or make a round trip around the MacRitchie Reservoir. Either way you can come upon the ranger station and you can have your toilet break or hydrate yourself before continuing your hike. Enjoy everyone. Cheers.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Well maintained walking trails; happened to see monkeys, lizards, squirrels, beautiful birds, etc."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,The treetop Walk is partly closed
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"One of the trails for the nature lovers. It is for the Bravehearts. You walk through the thick tropical forest looking at the various species. If you are lucky you will also encounter monkeys, serpents etc. Overall a good break on the weekends."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,"Very crowded, people actually walk everywhere, speak very loud and scare the fauna around. The path is well maintained and the cooler temperature is pleasant though."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Cooling. Well maintained trails. Best walk along the reservoir.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great walk, multiple routes from beginner to intermediate. The treetop walk is a must do."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Good. Get to see the tree top up close. Short Distance though. Nice Scenery.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,Nice forest area. One time watch. Good for casual outing
MacRitchie Nature Trail,1,No rain shuttle
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,ALways lovely to walk here if the weather is not too sunny. But I dont really like the monkeys. I wish there could have more birds or release some swans in the lake. Then the experience will even be better.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Spectacular views from the bridge! It's quite a walk down, but well worth the time. After which you can rest at the rangers station or exit either Venus carpark or back to MacRitchie carpark."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,I did the my usual route which is about 7km. Slow jog til the slope leading to the treetop and after that is walk all the back to carpark.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"The MacRitchie Tree Top walk is a one way entrance and exit; also usually rather crowded during the weekends by Walkers / Hikers / Tourists.

Please be discerning to others, let them pass if you are thinking of hogging the walkway to take pictures."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Safe, scenic and breathtaking."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Theres alot of rocks on the paths be careful
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice walk
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Who wouldn't love nature
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Peaceful wildlife. Away from the city. Well maintained.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"If you like wild animals, you will definitely love this nature adventure"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nature lots of trees and some wild animals. A good walk
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A scenic treetop bridge which is great for photos. Can get crowded at times. Beware of random monkeys
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Please note the opening hour.  During public holiday, it can get crowded.  Also if you are taking this trail, might as well visit the tower nearby especially if the weather is good and in the morning.  You may see some birds"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,2,It's temporary closing for treetop walk but others trail still opening
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,You want long and peaceful walk in forest and lake please chose this place
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"An absolutely unique experience in Singapore. If you like nature and a refreshing (and slightly challenging) hike, you mustn't miss this!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Nice area, in the forest, but dont expect too much 'wild's (nature, -life. ). With loudy walker's around few animals can be seen. The tree top wall itself is a 200m stretch in the middle of the trail."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great trekking spot. Safe and easy to complete.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Lots of ups and downs. Elderly and unfit people should note.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Relaxing,  fantastic view its very good for walking, running hiking and easy access of bus transportation very comfortable.. Comr and visit it's just awesome place"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"10km hiking, suitable for beginner. It's good for escape from city life."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Long queue on public holidays. Go early to avoid the queue, the track to the bridge takes about an hour. Dress appropriately n drink lots of water."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Nice hiking trail
If u are lucky u can encounter wild tortise wild boar n snakes
Monkey is always there for u to see"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Great place for walking and exercise. Remember to bring water and keep yourself hydrated.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Very nice place to visit in Singapore for adventure seeker!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Beautiful nature! 7km round walk. Highly recommend.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Quite an interesting 6 km round trip walk from Venus Drive car park to the Tree Top Walk, a steel cable hanging pedestrian bridge. Wild monkeys are good neighbors."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Nice view from above the trees. However, quite a challenging trek in and out. Total of about 6km"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"I started from the car park at Venus Drive, the road that takes you to Island Country Club. It took me about 1.5 hours to complete the journey i.e. from the car park to Tree Top and then back to Venus Drive. Total distance covered is about 8km.

The route comprises of boardwalk, rocky pathways, track, metal road and staircases. The suspended bridge where you can see the top of many trees gives  you a sense of achievement when you are there. Depending on the time of visit, you will also get to see many monkeys who are out for a breath of fresh air (they are out usually from 11.30am to 12.30pm and from 4.30pm to 5.30pm). Feeding them is definitely a No No else you will be asking for trouble. Never also to carry any food or fruits with you.

Access to the suspended bridge is closed at 4.45pm. It is also not opened on Monday. There is a Ranger station with toilets and water cooler about 300m before the entrance to the bridge. It's good to take a short break before you proceed further.

This is one of the best spot in Singapore where you can truely build your stamina before you venture for a long distance walk or hiking."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Really great views. Don't go if you're afraid of heights. The paths in the park are all paved so you don't need hiking boots or anything. An easy way to get out of the city.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Nice walk, great to be in the middle of a city and can't see buildings. Can be muddy if it's just rained."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Very interesting.  The best hiking track
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Hard hike! A bit crowded but be prepared for a workout!

MacRitchie Nature Trail,2,Because the trail to treetop is closed for renovation

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Wonderful place to walk in the trees and get in touch with nature. Defintely take a walk to treetop and, if you're lucky enough like me, you'll get to see monkey walking on the wire :D"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"A nice place for nature's walk & observations, & family outings.

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Come here to relax the mind take in the fresh air, detox the body of stress, tension and negativity. Leave your naggings at the carpark. Leave your office office politics at the main road. Leave your anger at the entrance. Leave your complaints at home. Leave the gossips at the hawker centre. Leave your music to yourself. Let the sound of the nature surround you, let the positive embrace you. Share the nature, share your smile with others. Be considerate, be happy, be positive, be rejuvenated when you leave and bring the goodness with you and let it help you be a better person."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,Nice trekking to Treetop viewing. Vice good views at treetop level

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Awesome experience for 1st timers but not for weak heart who scared of height....
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Went there with lot of expectations. Weather played spoil sport and we couldn't go the trial due to heavy rain. People coming back told that there are no shelters anywhere along the trial. This could be improved as needs some protection from extreme weather.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"What a hitch, good place to hang out"

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Pretty unique place to visit in Singapore
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"This place is located in the middle of the Treetop walk from the west side. This place is one of the biggest reservoir in singapore and the view is very beautiful and scenic. However, there are still many wild animals like lizards and snakes, so a need to aware of this.

You can visit this place from the treetop or Lornie road. The place is very tranquil and you can feel the power of nature. Many people do trekking or exploring using the bicycle.

I really recommend for all travelers who come to singapore to do trekking to this place, rather than do shopping in malls! it would give you another new experiences."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,A good break away from busy city
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Nice view with many wild animals.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Like paradise!!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,1,actually very amazing place. but I hate if suddenly heavy rain
MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,"Brought a Group of German tourists from Cruise Centre.  We manage to see a racket tailed Drongo, a couple of plantain squirrels, 2 wild boars and a flying lemur on the way out. Walk takes about 3-1/2 hrs to complete. Water coolers (2) available at Ranger station. Be wary of the  Male macque at the start of the Treetop bridge, he's waiiting to grab any food carried in plastic bags. Other than that it should be good walk."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Rainforest experience in heart of city. Good walk 10.5km or more
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,If you want a shorter route. Go by venus drive carpark.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Very good
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Such an incredible view
MacRitchie Nature Trail,2,No pets allowed so sad for my doggie.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Awsome nature walk..watch out for the monkeys. They stole my water bottle!
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Great place to bring children to exercise, the tracks are not difficult for children above 5 years old."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Great walk, lots of ""nature"". Would be 5 star if not so busy."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Trekking is fairly simple with ample signs leading to the treetop walk. Routes are clear as the path is used by numerous trekkers going the same path week in and out.

Trekkers who are afraid of heights, fret not as the bridge is very secured and not as ""shakky"" as you wold think.

On a normal pace, the whole journey from parking lot to the treetop and back would take you approximately an hour to complete.

However, don't rush through as there is more to explore. Lush greeneries and flourishing flaura and fauna. Keep a lookout for rare birds, insects and at times, monitor lizards which will cross path.

Note to first timers, please bring along ample water as the ranger shed is a good 2KM walk away where you can replenish your water supply.

I have seen trekkers with prams and bicycles. Please avoid bringing them along as it will impede your progress.

Free parking is avaliable via Venus Road.

Enjoy and keep on trekking. ✌🏻"

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"Enjoyed morning trek in macritchie walk. Best place to burn some extra calories on weekends. Should carry water or isotonic drinks with as nothing is available once you enter. Total 13 km walk, exits are available for drop outs. Tree top bridge is a must to see and keep in mind, it is one way route, so plan your path wisely to walk less. Otherwise you may end up with 3 additional km. So many paths intersections. Always gives you new feeling if you try new route every time."

MacRitchie Nature Trail,3,The tree top walk is very small but good view but the road to and from it are tooo long and steep.
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,"Great destination for adventure-seekers and tourists looking for nature-inspired place in Singapore. It's not that hard to reach the jumpoff point. While trekking, we saw troop of monkeys fighting so watch out for this, you might need to take extra care. We just left the spot immediately to avoid any dangers. Trail signs and directions are visible and always helpful to get to the treetop walk. Take a lot of pictures but be sensitive enough to limit if you're already causing delays or blockage to people behind you. Put on sunblock lotion and wear caps for protection. Have fun!"
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,Very nice walk
MacRitchie Nature Trail,4,Clean and with many healthy looking wildlife.

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"It was quite a trek to get to the tree top trailhead. The first time I tried it, I had started from the Macritchie reservoir park and had to turn back as it was past 5 pm which was when the critical tree top section closed. I finally made it on my second attempt by starting earlier on the second attempt. Worth the trek up! Do note the bridge is very narrow and meant for walking in a single file..."

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"The TreeTop Walk (TTW) is the highlight of several long hiking routes in MacRitchie that brings you through the different stages of a mature secondary forest. The first of its kind in Singapore and in the region, this free-standing suspension bridge connects the two highest points (Bukit Peirce and Bukit Kalang) in MacRitchie and offers a bird's eye view of the community of plants and animals that live in the forest canopy. The total length of the walkway is about 250 m and its height from the forest floor varies, with the highest point at 25 m."

MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"(Translated by Google) It was really impressive to see the unspoilt jungle and wild animals, and it was fun but difficult.
There is no detour in the middle of the mountain climbing time of 4 hours and 30 minutes and the total distance of 8 km, so it is recommended that you prepare your mind well before going up and feel it at least once.

(Original)
때묻지 않은 밀림, 야생의 동물을 볼 수 있어서 정말 인상 깊었고, 재미는 있었지만 힘들었네요.
산행시간 4시간 30분, 총거리 8km 정도 중간에 우회하는 길이 없으니, 올라가시기전, 마음의 준비 단단히 하시고, 한번 정도 느껴 보는걸 추천합니다."
MacRitchie Nature Trail,5,"(Translated by Google) You can follow the indicator from the Merizhi Trail to the tree top walk. The Merizhi Trail is very good. There is a steep slope in front of the entrance of the treetop walk. After the suspension bridge, you have to climb a stairway up the stairs. The slopes of other roads are not high. I feel that there is a sense of oppression: I often encounter monkeys sitting on the treetop walk bridge and want to cross the backpack. Because the bridge is very narrow, it is fearful that the naughty monkeys will be afraid, but basic They won't attack passers-by, just Pippi's.

Remember that the treetop walk suspension bridge is not open on Monday, but the surrounding trails are still available. It takes about 5km to get to the relay station from the MacRitcher Trail. It must be the only stoppage in the middle station to add water and the toilet. The MacRitchie Trail can also be accessed by Bukit Timah to climb back to the main road and reach the mrt :beauty world for about 12km.

If it is a single want to take a yellow line ~ from mrt:marymount walk 15 minutes to the entrance of the trail along the map yellow line ~treetop walk~tower~golf link~ river bank circle and then ~mushroom cafe meal ~ go Back to the original mrt, the whole process plus head and tail back to mrt about 14km, go for a little faster than 3 hours to complete.

(Original)
可以从麦里芝步道一路顺着指标上到tree top walk，麦里芝步道是很好走的，在treetop walk入口前有陡坡，出吊桥后要爬一段往上的楼梯，其他路段坡度不高，觉得比较有压迫感的是:常会遇到猴子群在treetop walk吊桥上坐着，想要翻路过人的背包，因为桥很窄，所以要通过时而调皮的猴群会怕怕的，但基本上它们不会攻击路人，只是皮皮的。

记住周一treetop walk吊桥是没有开放的，但周边步道还是可以走的。从麦里芝步道接到中继站约有5km，一定要在中站加水和上洗手间那是唯一的一个停点。麦里芝步道也可接到武吉知马爬楼梯接回main road，到达 mrt :beauty world全程约12km。

如果是单一想走麦里芝一圈(yellow line)~从mrt:marymount步行15分钟至步道入口沿着地图黄线~treetop walk~tower~golf link~河岸一圈再到~mushroom cafe 用餐~走回原mrt，全程加头尾回到mrt约有14km,走快一点3小时可完成,。"

Sandbox VR,5,"We have been to Sandbox VR twice and it was a great experience both times. First time, we played Amber Sky 2099 and the following time, it was the Curse of Davy Jones.

The staff does a good job of briefing you on the system and helping you put on and take off the gear. We had some minor technical issues during the game, but the staff fixed it right away. They also helped to take some pictures while we were playing. In the end, you get a movie style trailer of you and your group playing and some fun in-game stats emailed to you as a memento of the experience.

While you can play with two people, it is recommended you come with more because it's more fun and you can be more competitive in the games."
Sandbox VR,5,An awesome place to bond with your family members or friends. Enjoyable moments which would be captured by Sandbox VR in video format for safekeeeping as memories. Worth the money spent. Peak and non peak days have different pricings hence check on their website. Place is located at Orchard Central #05-31.
Sandbox VR,5,"Amazing experience definitely must try! Went on the star trek adventure, and it really was quite amazing. Gear is quite heavy thus might be too overbearing for kids. Headset might be a little big for kids too. As ling as you book before hand, process is quick and easy. Best thing is a video is also given free at the end and is really fun to watch after."
Sandbox VR,5,"It was super fun! We each paid $45, played for about 30mins, killing zombies. The staff was very pro, keep things sanitized coz you’ll sweat like hell even though you played for a short while only. Right after you finished, you get two short video clips. I’d come again."
Sandbox VR,5,Awesome experience especially if ur visiting with a bigger group... very friendly staff who makes sure u get a good overall experience. The game span lasts for 30 mins which is enough to enjoy the entire experience. U dont feel any dizziness which is a common discomfort with VRs
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome place ! Would love to visit again ! Me and my friend play 2 game at same day , although it was tiring but is really so fun and impressive ! The staff are friendly to help us take extra video of using our mobile phone too :) highly recommend for gather activities"
Sandbox VR,5,Cool experience. It’s an est 60min session. You may feel the equipment is heavy but you will be used to it after the first 10 mins fighting with disgusting af aliens.
Sandbox VR,3,Played the zombie game. It was fun and staff was very friendly and helpfull. Although parts of the game was laggy. Overall it was a fun day for us.
Sandbox VR,5,We went there on 28th Mar and the lady with red dyed hair was very informative and helpful as it was our first time as well. She made it an very pleasant experience overall. Please send our compliments to her. We didn't manage to ask for her name.
Sandbox VR,5,"Immersive experience, surpassed my expectation!
I would love to come visit again, really good to bonding. Can shoot each other."
Sandbox VR,3,"Second time I've been there. First time (2 years ago) was really fun, very immersive experience with tons of excitement! We went back this weekend and the tech kept falling - half of our team couldn't move their virtual hands (an important part of the game), and they had to reset the program twice. Maybe the equipment needs an overhaul?"
Sandbox VR,5,The whole experience is nice and enjoyable. Equipments are a bit heavy otherwise ok 😊
Sandbox VR,5,Awesome full VR experience.  Very fun adventure with motion and spatial tracking. Played the deadwood mansion and was able to make it quite far but ultimately failed.  The tech is state of the art and the guides were friendly and helpful. Will come back again to try the other game soon. Highly recommended.
Sandbox VR,4,"Having tried both Zero Latency and Sandbox VR, I would say Sandbox VR is better.

There is less walking in Sandbox VR, and hence the chances of you colliding with your teammates are low.

Also, because Sandbox VR uses motion capture to determine your position accurately, there are more interactive options available, such as reviving your teammates and solving puzzles.

The haptic feedback vest and the fans in the room plays a part in making the VR game as real as possible.

At the end of the game, I like that Sandbox VR gives you something to take home for remembrance. I wasn’t expecting that; it was a pleasant surprise."
Sandbox VR,5,Very fun experience! The staff were great I did have some mike problems but they quickly fixed it. The game we played was difficult and me and my friend died a couple times but they reset that level and let us continue. All in all great experience I would recommend this to anyone
Sandbox VR,4,This was an awesome experience. Of course a portion of the time spent was on dealing with the technically aspects of the game. Making sure all the mics and the earphones and the visual aspects of the game were in sync. The staff did a very clear explanation of the game and its mechanics and were also extra patient with us cause we were too excited. Virtual reality was really a must try experience. Your mind will be blown away. We had to pause a couple of times due to some technical difficulties. After the game they had even put together a video for us. So that was very nice. All in all it is worth every dollar. There are 3 different scenes to try we did the deadwood mansion this time but will surely be back again!
Sandbox VR,5,Thanks for a fun afternoon of play with the boys. Pirates next!
Sandbox VR,3,Overall experience was OK but the masks (and probably the headphones too) were quite smelly. I saw the staff wiping them with tissue papers after our play but I think they should do deeper cleaning like washing or something like that.
Sandbox VR,1,"Worst VR experience. Ever.

My friends and I have encountered several issues during the game:

1) The vibration on my vest was sync to someone else's, even though that's quite a serious issue, they brush it off and told us it won't impact the experience. But isn't the point of the vibration vest part of the whole experience?

2) The gun doesn't function properly, it won't fire throughout the game. We have to paused the game multiple times because of this issue.

3) Non-existent customer recovery - after all that issues, we didn't receive a single aplogy for the lousy experience or their faulty equipment. The staff basically rushed us out of the door and call it a day.

I have been to other similar VR game arena in Singapore before, this is by far the worst - in terms of professionalism and experience."
Sandbox VR,5,Instructor was very helpful and friendly. The game and body sensor tech were great🙏🙏
Sandbox VR,5,Really fun experience. One of the better ones I've had in VR. They share a video of your actual gameplay at the end (same day) which is phenomenal value! Star Trek was a lot of fun. 30 mins flies away.
Sandbox VR,5,"Our 1st VR game. Very exciting and reality game. Clear briefing done by the friendly and approachable staff before the start of the game. If you have any doubts or issues before the start or during the game, you may approach the staff directly. We enjoyed our game very much. Thanks to my team mates for the team efforts to make this a wonderful experience for everyone! Highly recommend to those who love to try VR game. For your safety, please take note: To those who have motion sickness or will feel giddy during the game, please approach the staff and inform them know if you are not feeling well before or during the game. 😎 😜 👍"
Sandbox VR,5,"The best body VR experience in Singapore.. We went for a team event and chose one of the themes for Gaming , max six players and minimum of 2 required for a session.. the setup and instructions were simple to follow and what follows is something you have to experience.. Min height restriction if 1.2 m incase if kids want to play.. You just go and get immersed in a different world.."
Sandbox VR,5,Very pleasant experience. I wear glasses and normally get motion sickness easily. But didn’t feel sick at all after 45mins game. Friendly and helpful staffs as well. Highly recommend!
Sandbox VR,2,"Hello, the contact number is no longer valid
can you contact me, I need to change my booking date"
Sandbox VR,4,"Really fun experience.
Try to go 15 minutes earlier to register, strap in and the briefing.

1st time we played aliens and 2nd time was zombies.

Although you don’t walk around as much, it was felt super real. Great fun with a small group of friends!

You do sweat a bit, so the gear does smell. Remember to bring wet wipes for your face and an extra tee for after!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Fantastic experience. Did this as a group of 5 with coworkers, and we all loved it. What an adrenaline rush. Instructions weren't 100% clear and a little rushed, but we figured it out. We did the alien one, which was fun and challenging. Highly recommend and would do again."
Sandbox VR,4,"Whole VR experience with sandbox VR. Audio was alright. But we couldnt hear each other as well. Visuals have low latency which is excellent. Would like to have more info in the briefing for us especially people new to gaming and understand rules of the game.
It's overall quite fun though a little on the pricy side. My friend with slight motion-sickness didn't get so visuals are good."
Sandbox VR,4,"Had the time of our life here! Best activity than the usual dates! However, do hope they can review the package to allow for 2 games instead of 1. Price point slightly steep but worrhwhile for an experience, but not as an activity to keep coming back for especially if you are on a budget! Otherwise, it was awesome!!"
Sandbox VR,1,"During the boss fight, the wire fall out and the staff refused to pause the game. So basically I'm not playing throughout the entire boss fight. Its not just me, 2 of friends screen hang. Black screen. waste money.
Full of technical issues, the first time when I came, we are told to come back another day because they can't continue the game. Played both deadwood mansion and Ambersky. Pause tons of times throughout.

To your claim below that the issues is fixed in 1 minute.
Nope. The mic is not working.
The pistols were faulty.
Everyone of us is at least having 1 issues with the equipments.
2 of them screen freeze or blackout.
2 of them having pistols issues which your staff did not change even after they told them.

And to correct you. I did not throw your equipment. Only treat the metal/plastic container/tray that holds the sensor roughly."
Sandbox VR,5,"Immersive VR experience!
You will put on motion sensors on your body, and wear a helmet with a headset, that completely isolates the outside surroundings from the VR environment.
The experience is quite surreal.what you hear and see is completely of the game's.
The game then guides you through a tutorial on basic functions and what you can do with your character, depending on the game and role you choose.
We played Amber Sky and there's 2 of us. So one of us had to be the Attacker, the other the Defender.
The VR environment will show you the borders of the game, in which you cannot cross physically. Otherwise you would hit the wall.
Game is quite challenging for 2 pax, so if they give a maximum pax, it might be better to go with that to be able to clear the game more easily.
Would come again to try other games!"
Sandbox VR,5,Really fun and immersive. Came here twice. Highly recommend deadwood mansion. Hope you have more mission modes soon !
Sandbox VR,5,Just wow!  An amazing experience!  I dreamed of holodecks as a kid and this is it!
Sandbox VR,5,Tried the Deadwood zombie horror game with some friends. It was incredibly fun and immersive. The staff are super friendly and explain everything so it's easy to understand how to play. Got really spooked by it but it was mega mega fun. Definitely want to try the other games now 😆
Sandbox VR,5,Love this VR! One of the best ones in SG!
Sandbox VR,4,"Booked two back-to-back sessions with Sandbox. The first game was a blast and we all had a thrilling time. There were some technical hiccups with the second session but the team tried their best to resolve it, failing which they were prompt and professional in going the extra mile to make things right. Thanks for a good experience!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Truly immersive experience, absolutely suitable for team/family-bonding. The staff at Sandbox were very helpful and attentive in guiding us. The best VR gaming experience I have been to in Singapore by far"
Sandbox VR,5,"A mindblowing virtual experience! Brought my girlfriend here for a date and we plan to go back again to try another game!

We played the Amber Sky and it was so fun that we did not want it to end. Not to mention, they even made a trailer and a video for us and we laughed at ourselves walking around the green room trying to kill aliens.

I recommend this to everyone!"
Sandbox VR,4,"We tried the curse of Davy Jones.

So in essence this is kinda a mesh between immersive experience and escape room. You do need to solve puzzles in the first person shooter game play. Games are refreshed once every 6 months.

Overall experience is quite good. Staff are very friendly. They will airdrop three videos of the experience and it's quite entertaining to watch. The only downside is the technology still has some latency. The fans and the feel of real wind is quite entertaining

The trackers are a bit odd but it adds to the whole immersive experience"
Sandbox VR,1,"My friend got injured while playing games here. He went out of red zones and the staff did not remind him at all till he fell to a metal rack in the room
The staff did not know how to do first aid so we need to clean the wound ourselves and bring him to A&E. Many stitches!!!
Overall bad experience. Pleas be careful when you play here."
Sandbox VR,5,"Deadwood mansion it's just incredible. Action packed, scary, dark, bloody. Amazing! Well done Sandbox VR!"
Sandbox VR,5,"it was SUPER FUN!!!!! 6 of us split teams into succeeding schedule coz the group of 6 slot is fully booked...better book early if you all planning to play as a group of 6.. but if you want to have non stop laughter watching your friends play then you can split by 2 teams and play in different sched.. btw, the staffs are the best!!! they help us take photos and videos during the game. they'll allow friends to watch you play inside as well. and the bragging video was uploaded the same day..
MORE POWER SANDBOXVRSG!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Sandbox VR,3,"Quite clearly Sandbox VR is taking our entertainment to the next level. In Singapore, the Sandbox VR (SVRS) establishment is rather tiny, but frankly when you are playing in VR the outside environment is not relevant. I attended a session at the SVRS this past weekend and while the reception was tiny, it was sufficient and the game interesting, interactive and fun though I couldn't see much.... The one thing that I found lacking (seriously lacking) was the treatment of people with optical impairment. I just wear normal glasses but without them I cannot see clearly at a distance. I brought a smaller pair but these didn't fit so I had to contend with unclear vision. The lens offered come in fixed left and right eye augments with jumps of whole numbers. Thus for me where there is a big difference between the left and right eyes the game had to be played with one eye. While I don't mind playing a one-eyed pirate every now and again, this gave the entire experience a disappointing feel and somewhat of an obscured memory. For the young staff it seems I appeared to be an annoyance so I smiled and chose lens that seemed to be able to correct a little my visual impairment. The particular lens I received was not clear so every now and then I lifted the googles a bit to get a better sense of what was going on. While the experience is great and can be enjoyed fully by people without any visual impairment or those with contact lens, if you have the former and can't wear the latter, I would recommend you give this experience a miss and wait for better equipment. Last but not least, my team mates who don't wear glasses enjoyed the experience and the following videos we received and even with my one-eyed game I managed to enjoy the VR experience, so three stars for a nice good experience but not for the visually impaired."
Sandbox VR,5,Super fun must go!!! Little pricy but worth every penny!!! Best
Sandbox VR,5,"A unforgettable experience.  The briefing was very clear, and the staff really paid extra attention to the kids.

We tried the Star Trek away team mission, and was blown away by how the we could even ""feel"" ourselves being transported ""4 to beam up!""."
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome experience, already the second time, well instructed stuff gave good guidance and it's always fun :)"
Sandbox VR,4,Not bad... but equipment is very heavy. But overall the experience is very reliatic with vibrations and all that.
Sandbox VR,5,Everyone should try this.. amazing experience. Worth the money.
Sandbox VR,5,A fantastic experience! This is not an average shooting game.. Its also involved solving the puzzles to move to the next stage. Will also be enjoyable to those who don't play games!
Sandbox VR,1,"The staff was not helpful or friendly. We played the pirates experience. Players could not interact with each other as the sound system was not working. They told us to raise our arm if something was wrong, we did that 5 times and nobody reacted. We got a voucher for the next time because things did not work. But we don't want to go back as the staff was unfriendly. So not recomendable, which we thought was weird as the reviews are not bad on average."
Sandbox VR,5,"Great VR experience. They have three different gaming scenarios - Pirates, Sci fi and Zombies. All three give a different experience. Personally, I liked the Pirates the most as it involves puzzle solving and team effort. Sci fi is more like a single player shooting game although played along with a team. The equipment and technology is state-of-the-art and the staff is cooperative to help you out and get acquainted with the new stuff. Each scenario lasts more or less about 20 mins. It is a must have VR experience. Would highly recommend."
Sandbox VR,5,"Well run, very amusing. Laughed a lot. Bit sweaty, but worth it.

I suppose thanks is in order."
Sandbox VR,5,"It was by far the best VR experience I have had. Really nice and polite staff, the VR room setup is top notch and the games are amazing"
Sandbox VR,5,"Absolutely great experience. The claim of being hyperrealistic holds true. Was my second vr experience and the best.

Great staff, lovely atmosphere and the game is intense but so much fun.

I will be back I still have some monsters to kill

And u even get a video of it :)"
Sandbox VR,5,"Interesting place, great place of entertainment either with friends or family.
Although it might be abit pricy but is worth a try."
Sandbox VR,5,Had an enjoyable time with friends today. Tried Deadwood Mansion and Amber Sky. Both highly recommended!
Sandbox VR,5,Very limited area for movement but good gaming experience
Sandbox VR,5,So much fun and quite sporty! We sweat a lot. You should definitely try it
Sandbox VR,5,Amazing experience. I'd recommend to play newest game - Amber Sky 2088.
Sandbox VR,5,A mind blowing experience to try. Highly recommended. Tried Amber Sky 2088. The storyline is creative and the stunts and visual effects are immersive and astounding. It felt like I was stuck in a world. Amazing 30mins!
Sandbox VR,5,Did a team game. Great experience and amazing graphics quality in VR. Overall totally recommend if you're looking for a good VR gaming experience.
Sandbox VR,5,"Amazing experience, staff were friendly and Deadwood Mansion episode felt incredibly realistic. Doesn’t feel like a tutorial, and they throw you straight into the game 👍🏻 Highly recommended"
Sandbox VR,5,Fun and amazing experienced playing game in VR. Definitely have to try this
Sandbox VR,3,Decent games and ok pricing but small space and very bad software and hardware issues.
Sandbox VR,5,"Great experience, really fun and smooth. Certainly the best VR in The country."
Sandbox VR,5,"Fantastic experience, fully immersive, great service by the staff."
Sandbox VR,5,Very fun experience. Totally opens up a new world.
Sandbox VR,5,Great location to have a good team building activities.
Sandbox VR,5,Fantastic experience I ever had!!!  I thought VR might be gives me some headache or vomit feeling but it was Super fine! And omg so much fun!!!!!!! I loved to kill all the zombies yay!!!!!!  It was great exercise too!!!!!  I will definitely recommend to my other friends!! Go go go!
Sandbox VR,4,It is such a nice experience :) a must-try! I am giving it 5 stars if only the gears weren't smelly like that of sweat. I hope the crew can find a way to resolve that tiny bit of issue. ^^
Sandbox VR,4,Been for the experience twice on 2 different games. It was always enjoyable!
Sandbox VR,4,Great team bonding
Sandbox VR,4,The bag is too heavy
Sandbox VR,5,"VR experience was great. No need to share a VR slot with anyone else. Went with just 3 person and got to use the whole room space. Set up was fast and easy, staff was really friendly. The set up includes a VR gun for you to use during the game and it was really cool. After the game, the store will offer you videos of you playing the game and also your own gameplay. Had a really great experience here :) Thank you!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Great customer service, had a lot of fun!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Pure fun! Played dead wood mansion, worth every dollar!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Phew, that was some adventure. Possibly the best 45 mins you will spend in Virtual reality. The Dead Mansion game is outstanding. Brings out all the punch of a team game and bond (or not) as friends.
Definitely worth adding to the list of places to visit in Singapore.
I'll be back."
Sandbox VR,5,"Wonderful product and great service! We went as first timers and the whole experience was friendly, smooth and fun. Instructions were clear and staff were there all the time to ensure we enjoy it, including taking photos for us. Visual effects were good, 3 - 4 people is the ideal team size to play."
Sandbox VR,5,"Interesting concept with great visuals! For a 30mins game, the cost is very affordable and it was time well spent!
They do update their games once in awhile and the graphics are just amazing.
Great service by the staff and the instructions given by them are very clear and concise!
Definitely a must try! A great experience!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Extremely fun! Genuinely a great afternoon out with friends. Strongly recommended if you're looking for a fun day out with family or friends. Otherwise it's actually very fun team building that can even be considered for companies!

We played the zombie game. Honestly not that scary, but you genuinely feel like you're in the room. Quite realistic. Truly a really unique fun experience."
Sandbox VR,5,First time trying VR and have a good experience at sandbox.
Sandbox VR,5,It was a great experience.
Sandbox VR,5,"I loved my time at this place. Although it is a little bit expensive, it was great fun to play along with friends in dangerous scenarios with no fear of actually getting hurt. The experience was also extremely immersive as they would turn on fans to simulate air rushing in through a door and we would actually hold prop guns. The motion trackers were also extremely accurate and responsive and the sound and game design were all superb. The equipment was top notch and there was enough space to move around in. I only wish that there would be more scenarios and weapon types."
Sandbox VR,5,Exciting new experience! truly a 4D experience!
Sandbox VR,5,"Omg! Our first VR experience! It was just amazing. We were two people and we played Amber Sky, I must say it was just A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!
The staff kindly detailed us on how to use the gears and set of instruction on how to play.
We enjoyed to bits. Will come again to play other games as well."
Sandbox VR,5,"Definitely the most realistic and immersive VR gaming experience ever! If you have myopia above 700 degrees, you will need to wear contact lenses to fully enjoy as they only provide corrective lenses up to 700 degrees. Definitely coming back"
Sandbox VR,5,"Great experience! The VR is truly immersive and extremely realistic. The vests even vibrate when you get ""hit"". Worth it and would go back!"
Sandbox VR,5,Excellent day out for my 11 year old Son and friends. One group played Davy Jones and the other played Amber Sky 2088. Both groups enjoyed themselves very much.  Everything started on time. Staff very great with the kids. Will come back again with my Daughter and her friends
Sandbox VR,5,"Great experience, clear briefing, patient staff. When we had technical issues, the staff helped to resolve them before we continued with the game. Throughout the game, the staff was very dedicated and used our phone and took lots of memorable shots and video. Had a great time."
Sandbox VR,5,"After your first game i bet you'll crave for another because that's what we did too! Don't worry though, there will be a 50% off if you immediately request for another game! Staffs are friendly and helpful, would come again given the chance 👌"
Sandbox VR,5,5 star experience. Played deadwood mansion (zombie game) and had so much fun - it was also a great workout. Staff were also super friendly
Sandbox VR,4,Been here twice and did the Zombie and Amber sky and it's lots of fun. Great graphics and no lag at all. Would recommend for a fun group activity. Personally like the Zombie one more.
Sandbox VR,5,"Our first time being here and it was awesome! The staff was friendly, helpful and very professional.. the game was fun and thrilling! Will definitely come back again!"
Sandbox VR,5,It is very fun and immersive. The graphics are beyond words! Try to come in 4 though and just do your bookings online. Once you are done they will even send you a video of you and your friends. The staff are very helpful and they are willing to video you if you lend them your phone.
Sandbox VR,5,"This is the future of gaming. Funnily enough you gotta be fit to play this game. It's good, awesome to get in some exercise. Now there's not much movement but in the future it's gonna be so much more interactive. Highly recommend the zombie shooter. It's like an arcade game but wayyyyy better."
Sandbox VR,1,"So we get there at 2:30pm and the guy tells us we have to wait for the next available booking which was 1 hour away. We decide it's probably gonna be worth the wait so we pay in advance and wait the hour. We get back there and there's a group of 7 or 8 people getting prepped so I'm thinking ""Sweet, More players!"" Then the guy proceeds to tell my wife and I he ""Accidentally"" double booked us with a much larger group and we would have to wait another hour to play. It was pretty obvious at this point he opted to squeeze in the larger group for more profit and make our smaller group just wait longer. Customer service 0! Took my money back and left. Ultimately the guys a liar and I don't contribute to any business with people like that at the helm."
Sandbox VR,5,"Brought my GF here for her birthday, and we had a whole lot of fun! We played Amber Sky 2088 and it was awesome!

Staff are friendly and very helpful in guiding you every step of the way from donning the equipment, to the game setup and game play, which was very good!

This was our 3rd overall VR experience and let me tell you it was awesome and actually even BETTER than the previous 2! The game vest and game itself take things a step further, which can be terrifying for some if you're not a gamer (think alien creature clinging to your chest, and feeling the vibration of it).

Overall gameplay was amazing, from graphics to the cool abilities one can wield during the game, such as pistols, rifles, and even a ""Captain America"" inspired shield you can throw at enemies and will boomerang back to you (loved that part honestly).

You don't do a whole lot of walking unlike other VR experiences, as each game room is not that big, but you will still need to move, it is not a stationary game experience, but it did not take anything away from the overall fun of the game!

So all in, we had a blast! (Literally blasting aliens too)
And it was huge fun!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Really great VR experience , very cool technology and great fun for friends and family.  Will definitely come back for the other VR experiences , easy to book the slots online and fill out forms before arriving.   Friendly staff!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Went here with my boyfriend to try out VR for the first time. We tried Deadwood Mansion where we have to shoot zombies which is not something I usually look forward to but this was one of the funnest game I tried. A notch up from my timezone experience. Perfect duration, good level of difficulty for the two of us. Will definitely bring a larger group next time."
Sandbox VR,5,"Staff: The 2 female friendly staff provided clear instructions and assistance with the VR equipments.

Game: Played the Curse of Davy Jones. Required shooting skeletons, ghosts and some puzzles solving. Not too difficult. Recommended if this is your first VR game. Very enjoyable experience overall! Will return for other games!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Definitely a fan of the VR experience! We did Amber Sky, and were extremely impressed by the high quality graphics and gameplay. The only improvement I'd like to see is if the experience wasn't confined to a small room and we could actually walk around during the game play, but I guess that's constrained by the space available. Otherwise, highly recommended and absolutely worth trying out!"
Sandbox VR,5,"First time at Sandbox VR and it was absolutely an amazing experience. The game was Super fun and engaging, and the stuff here are friendly and helpful as well! Gonna come back for sure and hope there are more games coming up in the near future!"
Sandbox VR,5,"It was very fun. The experience was very good and it was quite intense. The staffs were very patience and explain the game play very well. If the equipment can be lighter and smaller, it would be even better.

Definitely will return to try Davy Jone"
Sandbox VR,5,"This is one of the best room escape experience you can find on our planet, with VR that feels like Ready Player One. Immersive, intensified, and interesting. It is good for friends to hangout due to the team bonding. I wish that when fighting zombies, martial art skills may be allowed to make it more action-packed. Overall, it is very much a lot of fun."
Sandbox VR,4,"First time trying VR, and this place is amazing! Really good for small pax. Our experience wasnt as perfect as their rifles was not very responsive. It was better after they changed a new one at the end. Nonetheless the made up for it! Friendly staff!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Fun experience, especially with a group of friends! The VR was immersive and the graphics are really cool even to just watch and enjoy. Staff are helpful and someone is in the room constantly (not likely you'll need any). Plus you get a cool video at the end too!"
Sandbox VR,3,"Great experience but I am sure this have more possible upside. I was definitly amazed by the VR experience but the game should be better. In any case, an experience to try."
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome !
Very interesting and amusing experience.
Also great customer service. Really appreciate that.
Must try !"
Sandbox VR,5,"First of all, the staff was welcoming and friendly from the start. They were also patient and clear in their Instructions. As for the game itself, it was an adrenaline rush from the start and truly enjoyable in a heart-stopping kind of way. We will definitely be back for more! Keep up the good work!"
Sandbox VR,5,I came with my team for a really enjoyable time. Actually worked up a sweat playing the game. really got into the game quickly. Would recommend it to anyone.
Sandbox VR,5,The game was totally awesome! Highly recommend that you should experience this! We all had great fun! Will be back.
Sandbox VR,5,Super fun. It's worth the price. Mildly intense. The stuffs are super friendly as well.  10/10 will recommend. I will come again :)
Sandbox VR,5,Excellent good experience. Had lots of fun and laughter. Highly recommended. Enjoy ourselves and they have very friendly and cool staff!
Sandbox VR,5,Totally worth it! It was a workout too. We can't wait to go back. Good for groups of 3-6. The staff are very friendly. Nice location with plenty of places to booze or a grab a bite to eat.
Sandbox VR,5,Very good experience of playing the VR game. It’s very vivid and fun. The staffs are very helpful. Make sure to be on time for your appointment to enjoy full session.
Sandbox VR,5,It was a great teambuilding moment for us! We really loved the time spent playing Deadwood Mansion. We never expected that it would be so fun. A point and shoot game in VR killing zombies. Two thumbs up!
Sandbox VR,5,"Aarrrrrggghhhh, Matey! Never have we ever fought a pirate to the death...but we have now! We highly recommend the experience as a group activity with friends. It was a great time laughing and enjoying the entire experience. The staff were exceptional and helpful!"
Sandbox VR,5,MUST DO! This was SO much fun. The level of detail is next level great. I wish I could give a 10/10 review! Thanks so much guys! We will be back!
Sandbox VR,4,Interesting VR game play. 3 different game settings available. Abit pricy but good fun.
Sandbox VR,5,Amazing experience! Would definitely revisit the location again. A good place for team bonding with friends or family. 😊
Sandbox VR,5,Awesome experience and must visit....
Sandbox VR,5,"We did the Davy Jones adventure and it was a SO much fun! Very realistic and so exciting, great to do as a couple or as part of a group. Just a warning - it’s quite jumpy and you’ll feel like you've done a bit of a workout by the end!!"
Sandbox VR,5,This was my second time playing Deadwood Mansion and it was just as much fun as the first. Fun to learn from our previous attempt and try to do better to advance farther in the game. Would recommend without hesitation!!
Sandbox VR,4,The VR games here are quite good. Recommended to try out if it is your first time playing VR games.
Sandbox VR,5,"Played curse of Davy Jones, really fun and interactive, great for beginners as well. Felt as if it was real life, lots of screaming and teamwork. Will come back to try deadwood mansion next!"
Sandbox VR,5,"It was an afternoon well-spent being a VR Pirate Babe! And oh boy, let me tell you, I plundered some great virtual booty. Tons of skeleton smashing, parrot chopping, ghost-hunting adventure time. An amazing experience that I would definitely recommend! Come on, I gotta be a sexy pirate and played a great VR game. What more could you ask for? And as far as VR experiences go, this had dope physics ."
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome experience! Worth it! Great customer service! As they can help you record video and take pic as long as you passed your mobile to them. At the end of session, they make a video showing highlights of your session, half real half VR view. Great memory! We will definitely come back again to try the other two games. Great workout too, sweat like hell coz it’s too scary (Dead Mansion)."
Sandbox VR,5,"It was a really great experience. Interesting game with good team involvement and fun. A great change to conventional gaming. We will definitely be back for more. Kudos to the staffs for their assistance and guidance throughout, and for their great photos during the gameplay."
Sandbox VR,5,"Was totally impressed by the awesome gameplay and stunning graphics! We had loads of fun and the experience was nothing short of incredible. To top it off, the friendly staff are attentive and will guide you through every step of the way. Good job!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome , must try"
Sandbox VR,4,It was pretty cool to be transported into another world. The staff were also super friendly. Only downside is that I couldn't really hear my teammate in the game. Fun experience all in all.
Sandbox VR,5,Great first time experience. Our group tried the zombie version; good quality shoot-em up survival style game. Recommend going with a group of 5 or more for a unique experience!
Sandbox VR,5,Amazing place for team bonding as the games require seamless team work in order to progress to the next stages. The visual quality is absolutely mind blowing as I literally felt that I was in the haunted mansion myself! Kudos to the team for being helpful and professional throughout our entire experience. 👍
Sandbox VR,5,"Amazing experience! Professional, high tech, above all expectations! The best time I had with my son!"
Sandbox VR,5,Super fun and exciting! Professional team of staff to brief us on the use of equipment. Was immersed in the game and graphics were good. Lenses are provided for those who wear glasses.
Sandbox VR,5,Very realistic game
Sandbox VR,5,Really accurate and fun gameplay! Loved it! Second time back and still as fun. Amber sky was amazing ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Sandbox VR,3,"We played the amber sky and we were impressed by the visuals and effects - e.g. If someone attacks you - you get to feel the vibration on your chest, or when we were being transported up the shaft, we could feel a breeze across us.

The staff were patient in guiding us through and also helped us to take photos throughout our gameplay plus sent us videos via email after.

However there was some technical glitch with my gun - it wasn't firing properly and I had to pause the game a few times until the third or fourth time before they changed my gun. By then, we have already lost almost 70percent of a fruitful gameplay, and this has unfortunately affected the overall experience. Nonetheless, I brought this up to the manager after the game and they promptly assisted me in resolving my concern.

Technical glitch aside, this is still a must try for anyone interesting in experiencing VR!

Aside - For people whom are myopic, fret not as they have lenses that can cater from 200 to 700deg."
Sandbox VR,5,"Really immersive VR experience! The graphics are detailed, the haptic feedback suit gives you additional sensory experience, and the game is well designed to be a mix of shoot-em-up and puzzle solving. The staff are also fun and friendly, and they share videos of your experience after the event! Very great group experience and totally worth the price!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Absolutely fantastic experience. The graphics are surprisingly good and the fact that it tracks both feet, both hands and your weapons separately make it incredibly immersive. By far the best VR experience I have had."
Sandbox VR,5,It was as real as it could possibly get. The price is reasonable as well! Highly recommended to keep returning and trying out all concepts!
Sandbox VR,5,Tried VR for the first time here and it's really very fun!! We tried the new Amber Sky 2088 scenario and it's highly recommended for first timers!
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome experience, our first time doing this as a team bonding event and would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family! The staff were very friendly and helpful! Thanks Annette for the warm hospitality!"
Sandbox VR,5,Good length of time and entertaining setting with high quality visuals. Easy to play and great for team building.
Sandbox VR,5,"We've been to quite a couple of VR experiences overseas but I have to say this has been the most enjoyable and interactive.
The staffs are really friendly.
Will be coming back again!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Was a very thrilling experience. Not too scary, but definitely exciting. Would even consider coming again to try to defeat the game!"
Sandbox VR,5,The staff were very friendly and gave us clear instructions. We did Ambersky 2088 and it was a really good experience. Will come back again to try out the other VR games.
Sandbox VR,5,Experience is better than expected. Very enjoyable. Will definitely return again
Sandbox VR,5,"Did this for my birthday, and it was awesome. Great experience, super fun, and totally worth it. Immersive, virtually zero input lag, lots of fun and a nice adventure, even for video game newbies. Great birthday present from my wife!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Exciting and exhilarating team experience for the Deadwood Mansion. Too bad we didn’t beat the boss, but the shooting and screaming was fun! Staff were very helpful as well. Worth it!"
Sandbox VR,5,First time experiencing a VR game in a room. Me and 3 others had an amazing time. The staff were very helpful as well and the whole process was very smooth from start to finish. Will definitely visit again.
Sandbox VR,5,"One of the best things I've ever done in Singapore. Going into it I wasn't sure what to expect, but it blew my mind. Staff were awesome and the games were incredible. Can't recommend this enough for anyone wanting a laugh and to experience something new. If in doubt, give it a try and it'll blow your mind."
Sandbox VR,5,"Went for the first time yesterday and i am tempted to go the second time!
Highly recommend the zombie game.  It is exciting and fun! Great for bonding with friends."
Sandbox VR,5,"Thoroughly impressed with the quality and experience of VR here. There was a very minor delay during setup, but the team was swift to get it sorted. Would highly recommend for team building or a small group of friends."
Sandbox VR,5,This was a super cool experience! If you’re looking for something not touristy to do in Singapore this is definitely it!
Sandbox VR,4,"Great experience for a group of friends. Exciting, engaging game and attentive service. Will be back!"
Sandbox VR,5,Entertaining!heart throbbing! user friendly. easy to u play and adapt

Sandbox VR,5,Very fun and exciting! Graphics were really realistic and the staff were very helpful along the way. Will defo come back with my other friends! 💪
Sandbox VR,5,Came with a group of 4 friends and it was alot of fun. We enjoyed the Curse of Davy Jones game and would love to come back and try another experience. 😉

Sandbox VR,5,Really fun. Very immersive with the motion tracking. Will definitely come back
Sandbox VR,5,Extremely fun. Decided to come to this place for my friend's bachelor party and we were speechless of how fun and real virtual reality can get. Will definitely come back to Sandbox again for their other games!
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome fun experience. Pretty accurate controls. Graphics were fun and intuitive.
Highly recommend and definitely coming back here again."
Sandbox VR,5,Absolutely awesome!! My 72yr young mum loved it! Really reasonable price too.
Sandbox VR,4,Nice VR gaming setup... will be perfect is their gears are properly sanitized after each play
Sandbox VR,5,"What an amazing experience it's like being inside the game you're playing, and you almost feel everything if you get attacked by someone you can feel it, my favorite was deadwood mansion, it's more focused on attacking the zombies, whereas amper sky 2088 had some on defense and others on attack and it's a bit harder tbh. Both are great I recommend deadwood mansion."
Sandbox VR,5,"Tried all 3 games. Great fun! I highly recommend them.

XingHao is a great facilitator and awesome photographer. Thanks!"
Sandbox VR,5,Totally awesome experience
Sandbox VR,5,"Much more fun than I expected. Gameplay was pretty straightforward, but to be immersed in it is totally worth the time and money regardless. Best played with friends who have a shameless disregard for their dignity and pride. :P"
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome experience, great service, a tad disappointed by the high price but who am I kidding? I'll gladly pay again and try out a different scene!"
Sandbox VR,5,Very fun and friendly staff. Game ran well withoutmuch bugs. Easy game and great for team bonding! Super worth the price!
Sandbox VR,5,"Amazing! Had so much fun with my colleagues for a fun office activity. The technology level is really good, I love the experience and will definitely come back for more!"
Sandbox VR,5,Deadwood mansion is a must try!
Sandbox VR,5,Never expected to have so much fun! Staff is super helpful and friendly and it made our VR journey awesome! must try!
Sandbox VR,4,"March 2019: first time at sandbox VR. Found it very fun, does not feel dizzy at all like playing PS4 VR and using the controller to move around, given that you are actually walking around in a small area for sandbox VR. Played the curse of Davy Jones and it found it quite dynamic, not just about shooting skeletons etc coming toward you. But also some small puzzles to solve. They put a vest on you which vibrates when the enemies hit you as well which adds to the experience. We only had 2 people and I would think that with 3-4 people, it may be just nice, more than that and would be too crowded. Overall a fun immersive experience, but just a bit pricey at S$42 per person (weekend price) for a 30mins game"
Sandbox VR,5,Exciting VR game! A good place for bonding among groups of friends. Great service by the staffs who aid us in putting on the devices and explaining the games to us!
Sandbox VR,3,It was a fun experience. Great for a group activity. Would recommend
Sandbox VR,5,"Very awesome experience! Staff was nice and very helpful with educating us on what to do, and with providing assitance when there was a glitch with my gun. Also get to receive a video of the highlights of the game after the whole session.

Make sure you at least geab a quick bite beforehand, as it can be a bit of a draining activity."
Sandbox VR,5,"Excellent experience!! The staff here are really great - super friendly and helpful! They make sure to explain the process to you very clearly and are very careful in getting you set up so you understand how to play the game properly. The VR graphics are fantastic. Afterwards they also easily can airdrop videos (with and without the VR game embedded) to you of your gameplay, which was super fun and hilarious to watch."
Sandbox VR,5,Great experience with Amber sky. Stunning visuals and excellent gameplay. Will come back to try the other games. Gameplay video was sent to us after the game.👍👍
Sandbox VR,5,Absoulety awesome...so much and even better with a big group. Will definetly do this again...
Sandbox VR,4,Overall experience was great! The responsiveness could be improved but definitely worth going to try it out. Played the amber sky game
Sandbox VR,4,"Very funny experience in a group. But not quite flawless yet. Quite nothing like it if u have limited experience with VR. We experienced some gameplay issues however. Some black screens, stuttering, and unusual character movements. Which unfortunately deduct a little from the experience. But overall highly recommended."
Sandbox VR,5,Awesome experience! Tons of fun! Will come back again for another mission!
Sandbox VR,5,super exciting and the graphics are really really great! a lot of screaming (my friends) but in a good way! totally recommended!
Sandbox VR,5,The experience was more real than expected. Highly recommended to try!
Sandbox VR,2,"It's okay. The one in suntec got more space and horizontal movement while playing. This one is small space and some particular game you select, if all dead you are done with game."
Sandbox VR,5,The entire experience was great! Totally enjoyed it and will highly recommend it! One of the best VR I have played :)
Sandbox VR,5,"We played Davy Jones in a group of three. The content was superb, and the gameplay was smooth. Pro tip: if you don't want to ruin your end score, don't shoot at everything you see - your accuracy will go down."
Sandbox VR,5,"Outstanding time w friends, great group activity! The staff was friendly and the little video highlight reel as a momento was a huge bonus!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Just popped in with my 6 year old son. Best 30mins spent in Singapore.

Sandbox VR,4,"Really fun and unique experience using VR and motion capture, with 4D effects! Definitely gna come back to try the other maps they have, and hope they add more in the future! :)"

Although you might get a little motion sickness but that’s alright. Like horror?

Sandbox VR,5,"Loved it!

Awesome way to spend an evening"
Sandbox VR,3,"Checking In - Counter staff was friendly
Preparation - When we were in the green room - the crews were super cold towards us and really dampens our mood, giving us the 'am here to only give instructions, dont ask me questions attitude'  No work passion was shown throughout the briefing not even a smile on their face. We have problems with the mics (too strong echo) it wasn't resolved and we have to proceed with the game. Hence, we couldnt hear clearly any instructions given.
During the game - we love it and it was FUN-tastic'
After the game - again we got to see those crew giving WTH face and one gal even shouted at us and give us deadly glance when we try to remove the vest. She continued to stare hard at us even after we apologized.
Overall, it was depressing for we were in high spirits looking forward to enjoy the VR session. We will still go for the VR games (loving it) but will not hesitate to tell them off if they give us attitude again."
Sandbox VR,5,Great times! We tried zero latency as well and found this loads more fun!
Sandbox VR,5,Super fun! Especially for a group of friends! The after videos is the funniest! :) Will come back again!
Sandbox VR,5,I certainly had so much fun with my mates. Would recommend this.
Sandbox VR,5,"It was very fun and perfect!
We enjoyed ourselves!
Thank you very much!"
Sandbox VR,5,"Super fun, way better than just an at home oculus because you can play with people in the same room which really adds a lot to it. I also loved the mix of vr and motion capture technology which allowed a lot more immersion."
Sandbox VR,5,"Came here with my gf for the first time and it was a very fun although we were 15 mins late, we still had a great experience. Will definitely come again!!!"

Sandbox VR,4,"Great experience and workout in a short 30mins span of time, be prepared to carry the heavy equipments😝"

Sandbox VR,5,Super fun experience that will make you want to come back for more!!
Sandbox VR,5,Best fun I’ve had in a while! Easy booking on the website and helpful staff!
Sandbox VR,5,"Brilliant! The hosts were great in explaining how to play the game but the best part is when you play as a team. You wear trackers on your ankles and wrists as well as a feedback vest and carry a backpack. The weapons add to the realism, there is an entire room for you to walk about and play in but if you go near a wall your vr helmet will display a red wall. Minimum 2 to 6 players. We played the zombie - deadwood mansion and it was exciting and thrilling. Choice of weapons were a single shot rifle, machine gun and duel pistols. We had so much fun we had to come back the next day before leaving Singapore to play Ambersky, this is where you play as droids and have 2 players being ""attackers"" who have a rifle that doubles up as a flamethrower, the 3rd player being the ""defender"" who has a single pistol and captain America style shield, this made the gameplay different to the zombie one. All in all it's a must do!"
Sandbox VR,5,Our host was very friendly & helpful. Would definitely recommend this as a group activity!
Sandbox VR,4,It was quite fun . The service is good and attentive . The equipment is new and nice . But is a work out !
Sandbox VR,5,My first time on VR..It was fun.. Recommended..

Sandbox VR,5,"Very fun, will come here again with other friends."
Sandbox VR,5,"It’s the best VR game I’ve ever played, so I’d recommend it to anyone interested"
Sandbox VR,5,Great VR experience with friendly staff! Would recommend for small groups.

Sandbox VR,5,"Intense, use the MP5 for those who have weaker forearm. Great immersive gameplay!"
Sandbox VR,5,A really fun activity for the family ! Will come back for more ! :)
Sandbox VR,5,IIts absolutely the best hyper reality game i've ever experienced. Please do bring your friends along this place is where i call the real bonding session with friends. We have alot of fun through out the waves. We also build up teamwork and connections with friends.
Sandbox VR,5,"Interesting game to play with kids ! They enjoyed it , screaming and running all around!! Haha"
Sandbox VR,5,"Awesome experience here, played both deadwood mansion and davy jones back to back and did not expect such a great workout out of it! Great for team bonding and definitely very stress relieving, screaming and killing all those zombies. 😂 Gameplay was really smooth, had no lag at all! Definitely worth a try and would be back for more, especially being located in such a convenient area!"
Sandbox VR,5,Very fun and exciting ! 👍🏻👍🏻 Worth coming and good for team bonding
Sandbox VR,5,It was very fun and the best vr experiences Ive ever had and the story was really interesting
Sandbox VR,2,"Maybe I’m unlucky but there were many unpleasant incidents.
1. No sound from my headset. I kept asking is there supposed to be music and I could only hear people talking but the staff just ignored me
2. Middle of the game my CPU ran out of battery and interrupted the game (wouldn’t they charge prior?)
3. No briefing on what to expect from the game - I.e if whole dies the game ends so it’s crucial to stay alive and revive people

With fave deal and Safra deal its worth the $30 per pax but I would say I didn’t get a complete experience and my issues weren’t resolved. Quite unfortunate"
Sandbox VR,4,Quality equipment and loved the rendered video!
Sandbox VR,5,A little pricy but quite a refreshing and fun exprience. Friendly staff and easy gear up.

Sandbox VR,5,"Totally love the experience!

It was my bf's and I first time to try VR and our guests from France totally loved it! The hospitality was great from the beginning, and Adeth (hope we spelt her name correctly) was very accommodating. One of our friends had glasses on and this unfortunately this could not fit into the headset, but Adeth was quick and decided to take off part of it so that it can fit. It was still uncomfortable though, but that's no fault of the company I reckon, except perhaps to inform customers about it prior. They have lenses with degree provided but if you glasses degree is anything higher than 700, it will not help you see any better. Anyway, remember to wear contact lens before going for this one.

I will definitely be back to bring friends for this!

Thank you Sandbox!"

(Original)
公司给的福利，工作人员耐心，游戏体验感很棒，第一次玩VR，真心觉得不错"
Sandbox VR,5,"(Translated by Google) Since enemies will attack you, we recommend that you gather 6 people as much as possible.

Wear the machine on your hands, feet, back, and head. Members can talk with each other through the microphone. You will be given different weapons, so it is good to understand the characteristics and proceed.

Some of them can speak Japanese, so it's a good idea to check with the staff. It was also possible to change the game on the day.

You will get a summary of the video in the game, so it's very fun to look back at it later.

There are many bugs and the game has been interrupted many times, so I hope it will be improved.

(Original)
ガンガン敵が襲ってくるので、なるべく6人集めることをお勧めします。

手、足、背中、頭に機械を装着します。マイクを通してメンバー同士の会話が可能です。それぞれ別の武器を渡されるので、しっかり特性を理解して進むと良いです。

ものによっては日本語対応可能なものもあるので、スタッフさんに確認すると良いです。当日にゲームを変更することも可能でした。

ゲーム中の映像をまとめたものをもらえるので、後から見返すのもとても楽しいです。

不具合が多く、何度もゲームが中断したので、それが改善することを願います。"

Siloso Beach,4,"Siloso beach 🏝 can be visited while exploring the famous Universal Studios in Singapore.
This is one quiet beach with not much activity.
There are restaurants and cafes serving local food .
The backside of this beach is not protected so be safe there especially with kids. You can clearly see some ships sailing around there.
Overall, nice and clean beach with lots of coconut trees and lounge chairs to relax on."
Siloso Beach,5,Fun !
Siloso Beach,5,"Very large beach and gives a breathtaking view of the sea. There are some people there and that it is a generally relaxing place to be. It is easy to get to from the sentosa monorail. Holding sand is therapeutic for me and that I feel very relaxed here. It is a good place to spend time with friends. Overall, would recommend to Singaporeans to visit."
Siloso Beach,4,"I went for the Magical Shores experience at Siloso beach. Make sure to book the time slot online before going down.

Its a simple light show. The chance to play on the beach at night is nice though."
Siloso Beach,4,"Went to Siloso Zone 2 and booked the slot for 6-7pm, we're blessed with nice sky and clear view sunset view with good lighting for nice impromptu picnic.. The only dissapointment was, the slot was effectively only 30 mins, at entrance said need to pack  by 645pm, but 630 there were patrol asking to start packing alrd"
Siloso Beach,4,"The place is nice, I wanted to see the show but didn't know we had to prebook. I took a free bus ride instead 😅"
Siloso Beach,4,Went on Friday thinking there would be magical shore but there wasn’t. Beach guards will come and make sure everyone leaves at 10pm
Siloso Beach,5,"Relaxing picnic, sun, sea & breeze"
Siloso Beach,5,"Very relaxing place, highly recommend to family with kids and couple"
Siloso Beach,5,"Love it😍 relaxing place to sit, play sand and enjoy the view. Best place to unwind, spending time with friends and love ones. Wide sandy beach located in Sentosa Island"
Siloso Beach,4,Going by a cable car you reach this beautiful beach with spectacular views! You’ve got everything on this beach from water sports to adventure sports to plain hangout places for the entire family. The sunset here is something you wouldn’t want to miss so plan your day accordingly.
Siloso Beach,5,"A friend of mine ask me to go to the beach and boom! To Siloso Beach we go. Clean, lovely and easy to reach is all I can say. Will definitely come back and that's not a lie."
Siloso Beach,5,I love to go this place mostly in the late afternoon.  Just before sunset n watch the day turns into night with the gentle sound of the waves pounding the shore. Looking up the skies n gaze upon the dark skies with twinkling stars.
Siloso Beach,5,"One of the best choices for the beach lovers!

ITs not much options in Singapore where to spend the weekend so It will be one of the best!
ITs the nearest beach at sentosa island and plenty of things to do!
Food and drinks all nearby by the beach!

beach station and texi stand are nearby too!

enjoy your day and see you soon!"
Siloso Beach,4,"If you plan ahead and book a spot in one of the session, enjoying a day at the beach with kids yet keeping social distancing can be quite enjoyable.. although don't plan to leave around the same time as everybody else, otherwise the wait at restrooms to clean up can be extra long..."
Siloso Beach,1,Don't waste your time for an over-rated beach
Siloso Beach,5,"A quiet and peaceful beach, excellent for photography. This beach is awesome to hangout with family and friends, there are some extras to do here like bungee jumping.
Some good restaurants for food and drinks.
A must visit if you're in Singapore, you have to take a cable car from Universal studios to reach here."
Siloso Beach,5,"This beach is much more lively than the nearby Palawan beach, for better or worse. There are lots of fun activities like beach volleyball and drinking extremely overpriced drinks at the many bars along the beach."
Siloso Beach,5,Best place to hang out with! Can spend peaceful evening at Siloso Beach :)
Siloso Beach,5,Came here for grill fest. Was not disappointed by the ambiance and the people. It was hard to get around with 4 kids. If you were single and smashing beers this would be fun as well.
Siloso Beach,5,It's been very much refreshed since I last came in 1993. Please do come again. It's great to beat the virus with the sun!
Siloso Beach,5,The beach is quite big and clean. Has several chairs to relax on. Italso has a shop to buy important food items and beverages.
Siloso Beach,4,"Still fun, cool hammocks, nice views, great rope bridge, lookout towers, adrenaline activities like zip line bungee jumps,wave surfing, bars and cafes. Needs a refresh but still worth free ride on express train."
Siloso Beach,5,"Lovely white sand beach, clear pristine waters, sheltered swimming space... The best seaside place to swim in Singapore."
Siloso Beach,4,Well maintained beach and nice facilities. Great place to visit and a place to see the sunset and sunrise. There are also surrounding affordable food places
Siloso Beach,5,"Saturday, 5 Dec 2020, 10am.
If you need to go to the beach, you will need to submit online application for beach reservations.
Seems alot of people and there is distancing ambassador checking."
Siloso Beach,5,"Probably the best beach in Singapore. The beach starts from Beach Station on one side and Shangri-La on the other. There is a diverse range of activities and offerings, such as bungee jumping, zip-line, bars, restaurants and a children’s playground."
Siloso Beach,5,Plenty of F&B outlets and great outdoor activities. The running and biking trails are very well maintained and the place is splendidly clean!
Siloso Beach,5,Fantastic sand quality. Beach very clean and water not polluted. More for yuppies and the hip crowd as there are a few beach pubs around.
Siloso Beach,5,"Beautiful, warm , perfect infrastructure! Nice to cool down after visiting Universal Studios Singapore"
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful beach with nice cafes and restaurants. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy the views.
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice beach, we were there after sunset. Arrived and left here by cable-car."
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice beach with coconut trees. Enough space for all. Come with your picnic mats, frozen drinks, sunblock & dip in!"
Siloso Beach,5,Good place for locals to travel coz there's few beaches here. It's one of the places that can enjoy and relax urself~
Siloso Beach,5,"It is a very peaceful place to visit. If you want to escape from your daily routine and give yourself some time this place is most suitable for it. There was not so much rush, beach was kept very clean and maintained"
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice views and a nice breach. But the sands are not fine enough. As a Hong Kong people, I think HK has more quality breaches."
Siloso Beach,5,"Superb beach. Excellent atmosphere. Sunny haven.
Coolest bars and restaurants. Siloso,Singapore's hippest beach, is the beach to head to for.
You can surf a man-made wave. Chill-out in a whirlpool bath on the beach. A host of shopping options available. All-day menus from bistros and restaurants. Skim-boarding, kayaking, cycling, rollerblading etc available. At dark enjoy  parties, music, lively bars and restaurants every night"
Siloso Beach,4,Need booking to enter. Due to covid.
Siloso Beach,3,"It's quiet small beach with more number of people.

Con:
- Bit stinky.
- Crowded

-Pro:
- Food courts are available.
- Easy reachability via bus.
- Water Sports & bungee jump is available.

Take a bus which is cheap and convenient."
Siloso Beach,5,"Amazing Artificial Beach.
Check out the cool photos that I have uploaded. You will definitely make you mind to visit the place.

Government has made all necessary arrangement for your hassle free beach swim, enjoyment and safety.A must to place while in singapore.

Enjoy free bus ride anywhere in sentosa."
Siloso Beach,5,Lovely place. Great playground for kids. Trapizza is a nice place for food.
Siloso Beach,5,Dropping here.. from cable car. The beach is clean and nice it’s nice to walk and watch the sunset. There’s also a restaurant near by where you can drink the famous Singapore sling 😂
Siloso Beach,5,A beautiful island transformed from a sleepy village once occupied by staff of Singapore Post.
Siloso Beach,5,"Siloso beach Singapore is a very clean, sandy cove on the Sentosa Island. The beach is popular with families throughout the day and is a major partying hub at night. It is one of the best places in Singapore to relax. The view of the scenic coastline is awesome. Siloso Beach is actually not a natural landmark. The sand on the beach was imported from Australia and is kept exceedingly clean. Siloso has more amenities than nearby Palawan Beach. There are various dining options available here and lots of adventure activities for everyone in the family."
Siloso Beach,5,It's a part of Sentosa Island ! Plenty of Fun filled rides to enjoy. Believe Me Guys..even One whole day will be less to Enjoy! Evenings one must stay in Silosa Beach to enjoy !!! Don't miss.
Siloso Beach,5,"Come for office gathering, i think the beach not soo attractive, but for calm and relaxing is good, but the view not interesting."
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful beach for sunset and walking along the shoreline. Tram service does not go to Siloso beach so visitors have to walk from Palawan beach and back. There are regular shuttle bus services but walking is probably faster and easier.
Siloso Beach,4,Quite a nice place. I imagine the atmosphere would be much more lively without COVID. Nevertheless you get to see some great sunsets here.
Siloso Beach,5,Very laidback vibe. From buzz city centre to this relaxing beach just takes less than an hour. A great place to visit in both day time and night time
Siloso Beach,4,"Apart from this beach is artificial, it's still pretty nice. Clean and well maintain. Good for weekend activity! You can bring hammock, book, sun cream and enjoy the sunset. Not too bad. 👌🏾"
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful beach with an amazing variety of activities and eating places. Would highly recommend.
Siloso Beach,5,"Very nice place :)
It's super close to the port, so maybe not the best place ever to take a bath: apart from this, however, there are lots of activities to do along the beach, not to mention the small isles you can reach by walking"
Siloso Beach,5,A very beautiful and clean beach in Sentosa Island. You gotta love strolling here early in the morning. You can also take a dip at your own risk. :)
Siloso Beach,5,Wonderful beach with lot of activites and sport facilities. A must visit to anyone who like adventure activities specially the Mega ZipLine.
Siloso Beach,2,"Did not like the beach - water was too dirty to my taste, a lot of plastic debris floating all over, big ships - mostly tankers waiting close to the shore. The beach was not populated when I visited it."
Siloso Beach,5,"Rasa Sentosa is closed as it has been converted to a quarantine hotel according to the staff who stationed at the gate.

Swimming is not permitted however there are plenty of activities available.  Bouncing, gliding and many other adventures."
Siloso Beach,5,"Good place
This beach save tree durring the construction work.
This resort have own earthworm system which help to convert left food into pesticides .
This place also used plastic very well when you enter you can see very beautiful work with the waste plastic botel"
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice view, friendly but slow staff"
Siloso Beach,4,"9 February 2020

4 stars for the beach.

But 0 stars for the taiwan night market. I went for the asian night market (ningxia night market) on 9 Feb 2020. The taiwan night market is an epic failure. Barely any patrons. There are 2 different zones. Zone 1 had about 14 stores while zone 2 had a mere 6 stores. All food and drinks sold were OVERPRICED. A shilin chicken that is sold at $5 outside is being sold at $12 here. Bubble tea costs $7 and up for a small cup.

In zone 1 of the night market, there is a smelly tofu store that stinked up the whole place."
Siloso Beach,5,This beach is in the Sentosa Island from where I visited Siloso beach. Awesome beach. During my visit there was sand sculpture show going on where people were making different statues with sand and also more to do adventure activities on this beach.  All in all great Siloso beach and nice beach walk as always🙂
Siloso Beach,4,"This beach is on Sentosa Island, fastest way is to take the Cable Cars.  Good scenery from above and then take sentosa cable for beach. There are different sections to beach, its all free so take a dip in all. The section near the tree house is popular with tourist. The beach is never packed."
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice place, walk for new experience"
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful beach and big city escape. Definitly worth a visit. Chill out here before a long travel.
Siloso Beach,4,"Serene, fine and hot whoo! Haha don’t forget to bring water to keep you hydrated as it was hot when we visited on the month of October. Very accessible after taking the cable car. Swim, snorkel or just take tons of memories it’ll satisfy your vitaminSea 🥰 craving."
Siloso Beach,5,"Very scenic, with a zip line and a bungee jump"
Siloso Beach,5,Nice getaway place in Singapore 😊👍
Siloso Beach,2,"This is Basicchips actually a nice beach with a lot of facilities like beach pubs, restaurants,  but the water is very dirty. It's not like only seaweed but also with a lot of plastics....
This beach deserved a better treatment."
Siloso Beach,4,Nice beach and easy to get travelling from monorail and shuttle bus..there have alot games which u can play for it and have fun..
Siloso Beach,4,Nice Beach and atmosphere is also very good
Siloso Beach,3,"It's great that there is a beach located in a city state albeit it's size. However, compared to other beaches I've been to, this beach feels artificial. I liked that the beach is really clean although I didn't see a lot of food options here."
Siloso Beach,5,"Several ways to go siloso beach, we love to take cable car there and enjoy the sunset 🌅 the sands there is relatively cleaner than the rest.
You can easily find peacock and spend time to play with them. Enjoy!"
Siloso Beach,5,A great location to enjoy a sunset. Restuarnt and Chill Out Clubs/Pubs is located sparsely along the entire stretch of the Siloso Beach. Picnic and friendly ball games are common sight here.
Siloso Beach,5,"One of the most enjoyable areas of Sentosa. It's the last stop on the monorail. You can try indoor skydiving at iFly, ride a Luge, watch the Wings Of Time night show, visit Mega Adventures were you can bungee jump, go on a giant swing, mega zip, mega climb, mega bounce and mega jump. You can also enjoy the beach and various bars. It's full of life and activity and I enjoyed the Siloso beach party here for new years. There's also a nature hiking trail from Imbiah that links up with Siloso. They had an absolutely spectacular fireworks display at the beach on new years. If you really want to get away the city and onto a tropical paradise, Siloso is your perfect option."
Siloso Beach,5,"I love the scenery
Very clean environment"
Siloso Beach,5,Enjoy the Sun Sea n esp the Sand! Yearly Sandstation here.
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice view, what a quite beach i've ever had"
Siloso Beach,4,"Good beach on Sentosa island. It has restaurants and bars... icecream stalls... also sunbeds and umbrellas to rent... a shadowed place under a huge pavilion... fine golden sand, palm trees..."
Siloso Beach,5,Sand is clean. All safty measures followed.
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice place at Sentosa Island. Good beach, good restaurants, nice programs for the entire family."
Siloso Beach,5,Super clean n good beach patrol for social distancing.
Siloso Beach,4,Nice beach on the Sentosa Island.
Siloso Beach,5,Awesome awesome awesome. Adult and child both can enjoy but some rides are expensive. We enjoy Santo sand stations marvel edition. This is amazing.
Siloso Beach,5,Best time to visit this place in early morning either in evening due to hot weather of singapore.
Siloso Beach,5,"Zip lining, bungee jumping, other suicidal activities: Siloso has it all. Go. Worth it.

Now the waters were on the whole clean and warm. But litter and rubbish was a small issue in one or two places. It’s such a shame. Folks, if you’re going to these places don’t be a tool, pick up after you.

The beach areas could do with a few changing huts dotted around the place.

All in all, we’d a great time. A refreshing change from the city."
Siloso Beach,5,Good beach in sentosa island.. not huge rush..
Siloso Beach,4,"We really enjoyed Siloso beach, it's boarded by many  food and drinking bars/ restaurants. There is plenty of shade available but make sure to bring plenty of sun block because the sun is very unforgiving. Short walk to the Singapore cable car, will cost around $33 for a 1 way ticket back to the mainland ( requires hopping off one gondola, walking about 3 minutes then getting on another gondola, great views, I'd suggest this :)"
Siloso Beach,4,"We love the sand work, hope to continue every year..."
Siloso Beach,5,Clean ..very nice ..
Siloso Beach,4,"Awesome!  The view is great.  I can see the ships travelling in the sea few hundred metres from the beach in the calm waters.  The floating bridge which connects to a little island like place is a treat to the tourist. Reaching the beach from a cable car is a different experience.  Connectivity is also good since there is a Mono Rail.  There is no much information about Siloso fort.  The details about the fort and the skywalk should be given to the tourist.  Since it is free, I think Singapore government is not interested in sharing the information.  But it worth to see the Sky walk tower near by the Siloso beach."
Siloso Beach,4,"Great beach , shallow water , clean and maintained. Missing some shade. May be trees  or some big umbrellas for shade"
Siloso Beach,5,Very nice view
Siloso Beach,4,Interesting smoke coming out of nearby islet. Lots of beach activities. Turbid water.
Siloso Beach,5,Better than before.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful clean white sand and plenty of space. Usually pretty quiet and is a nice little getaway from the big crowds that are around the rest of the island.
Siloso Beach,5,Good place for beach volleyball and other activities.
Siloso Beach,5,A net and clean also very beautiful beach
Siloso Beach,5,Siloso beach is a part of Sentosa Island of Singapore. The beach is very clean. The swimming areas are clearly marked. The shower and cloth change facility is very clean and is situated next to the beach.Life guards are present during swimming hours. Siloso beach and Sentosa Island are well connected to Singapore main city by multiple mode of travel. The best way to reach Sentosa is cable car ride from city which gives a majestic view of the Singapore harbor. There are multiple food joints in this beach to take care of your Hunter prangs. Please ensure you do not dispose of any plastic item on the beach. This beach also houses the famous Starwars Sand art display. In this display sand sculptors from across the world have created sand models of various characters and spacecrafts used in the Starwars movies.
Siloso Beach,4,One of the cleanest beach I have ever seen 😍
Siloso Beach,5,This beach is the furthest from the beach monorail station but it is quiet and not crowded. It is easy to find a spot in the sun or under the palms and relax or head out for a swim.
Siloso Beach,4,Beach is secluded... wrong! There are people on the other side of the photo. Actually wasn't expecting the number of people on a weekday.
Siloso Beach,3,Nice beach in Singapore you can reach there with trolley and mono rail the mono rail fare is 4$ Singapore and then pick free Santos's island shuttle bus from near mono rail station then you can rest anywhere. The one best thing is that in Santos's island you can get free mineral water and free WiFi hotspot near beach so enjoy your trip and ask free for your enquiry

The water, as everywhere else in Singapore, is warm all year round and nice to swim in. No waves or tides here. Of course the water in not very clear, but it is good enough for a swim or kids water play.

Siloso Beach,5,One beautiful part of Sentosa island! Highly recommended to spend time explore the island if you have enough time! You can take either the cable car to get there or the monorail available in the island!

Siloso Beach,5,This place is located inside Sentosa Island. Early morning would be really good to have a sea bath and this place is really relaxing.  You can observe the boats and ships travelling infront. Better place to have a family gathering. Shower area is nearby so it is easier to change your clothes. You can swim for a longer distance and the area is demarcated and covered with safety lines. Water is little bit cooler during early morning but will be warm with the sun rise.
Siloso Beach,4,"Very good place
One of the best scenery for sunsets"

Siloso Beach,5,I reached there by Cable Car Sentosa Line.
Siloso Beach,5,"Beach in sentosa
White sand"
Siloso Beach,4,"Lots of activities are packed along this stretch of Sentosa, which is called the Siloso Beach. Take the MonoRail to Beach Station. Right opposite Beach Station is the iFly - skydiving experience, and Singaporeans can make use of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers to offset for the payment. Skyline Luge, Mega Bounce, are amongst some of the other activities and a number of restaurants lined the beach front. Go for Trapizza for Italian food. Visit Fort Siloso, which is right beside Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa. This is the best preserved Last Fortress found here in Singapore by the coast. It is worthwhile spending at least an hour to tour the bunkers and understand the history of Singapore during the WWII."
Siloso Beach,4,Great beach with a nice view
Siloso Beach,5,What an experience by the tranquil sea. The sound of waves crashing onto the shore just give people energy. Towering conconut trees and beautiful flowers provide flora and fauna. On the rocks there are intricate and complex carvings  carved skilfully. Breezes blow by constantly. We had a whale of time building sandcastles and swimming. Well maintained and clean beach. Truly to remember.

You could go bungee jumping, take a ride on the flying fox, rent a bike and go cycling, or maybe even stop by one of the few bars and have a nice cold drink while admiring the sunset. This place will always have a special place in my heart for this was where my army buddies and battalion had our farewell party after our ORD parade. Good times."

Siloso Beach,5,Good to visit during sunset. I don’t think so swimming over there is good. The water is not so good. Can have a dinner in nearby restaurants. Bit expensive.  But once in a while it’s okay.  Crowded during weekends.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautifull placee....
Siloso Beach,3,"The Beach itself was clean with golden sand, however, it did look a bit false, man made. There was not a great deal going on here, sun loungers were available to rent from the restaurants.

Siloso Beach,4,"The beach is nice, I was there in the morning and there were maybe 2 more people. Before the Covid situation. You dont have to worry about your things, the beach is very safe and the water very hot. The only problem I had was that the boats and ships are too close to the beach. But the water is not dirty."
Siloso Beach,5,"Very good place. Visited during star wars sandsation event. Very creative sand sculptures. Otherwise also, it is good place to visit with options to chill at the open bar or do adventure sports nearby."
Siloso Beach,5,Multiple choices of water fun.
Siloso Beach,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the nearly installed state of the art lights, sounds and motion sensors along Siloso beach. What a magical night experience!"

Siloso Beach,4,Great place to visit and a place to see the sunset and sunrise. Relaxing facing the beach with a can of beer or red wine anyone is the greatest pleasure one can get.
Siloso Beach,5,Love this beach area. Morning stroll there is a blessing with great breeze too.
Siloso Beach,2,We need to register five days in advance via Sentosa beach website due to covid-19 restrictions.
Siloso Beach,5,Very nice place to visit. Enjoyed a lot.
Siloso Beach,5,nice
Siloso Beach,5,"This is the best beach I have ever seen in my life and is the cleanest among all the beaches.
I would like to recommend this to you if you are very interested in visiting beaches and play in water with your kids.
There are amazing water games at Siloso beach but games are played only by the people having reservation in Siloso resort."
Siloso Beach,5,"It's a different side of the beach when you come from the cable car.
Even if it's a lil extra walk when coming from monorail, do visit this side. It's fun and beautiful."
Siloso Beach,4,Lovely beech. It would be great if there were more shaded places.
Siloso Beach,1,"What a shame what was made out of this beach with this new restrictions, isn't it too much to treat such a peace of liberty and relaxation? Not worth anymore to go!"
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful place to spend time with the kids or friends. Recommended 1000% if you need a getaway.
Siloso Beach,4,"Good place for family/friend/school gathering.
Clean with decent amenities around.

Not much of a view. Close to no waves so there is no danger involved."
Siloso Beach,4,It's a place to have fun... Kids love it like the way we do...
Siloso Beach,5,"Very nice place to chill, sunset here is really pretty. The sand is pretty clean, there are bars here and good music being played. Super windy too! I recommend it for friends and couples!"
Siloso Beach,5,Enjoy at beach
Siloso Beach,5,Love the sea. Here very clean I am feeling like I was in the island that not one is there. It’s very very clean.
Siloso Beach,3,The circulation of the sea water is less than desirable due to barriers being put in place. Nice place to sun tan and picnic.
Siloso Beach,5,Bliss!!!
Siloso Beach,5,Lovely place
Siloso Beach,4,Amazing place w lots of beach clubs. Superb view
Siloso Beach,3,Good place it's not exactly Beach. It's small area suitable for seating for a while
Siloso Beach,5,"Excellent public beach on the south western side of Sentosa, near the Shangri-La hotel. Very easy to access and we'll worth checking out to enjoy a swim during any hot Singapore day. There are quite a few restaurants and bars close by, perfect to relax after the sand and sun. The beach also runs festivals from time time, details on websites."
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice beach with many activities available. Also many restaurants nearby, but somehow the beach vibe is missing a bit."
Siloso Beach,5,"I would say that Siloso beach is one of the cleaner beaches around. Though artificial, don't underestimate how good Singapore is at building man-made structures (take the recently opened Gardens by the Bay for an example). On the downside, if looking for a scenic beach or some tranquil, then this is definitely not the place to be."
Siloso Beach,5,Was here for the star wars sandsation!
Siloso Beach,4,Clean beach. Appreciate the fact that it's a man made one.   You will miss Goan beach more once you are here.
Siloso Beach,4,Very nice beach with plenty of things to do. However they seem to be renovating some parts of the chalet and the wave bar area at the moment.
Siloso Beach,5,Plan for evening and try to stay late to enjoy
Siloso Beach,5,"Excellent venue for friends, couples and small groups to enjoy the view of the beach and participate in events that happen there from time to time, such as the annual Siloso Beach Party that happens every year."
Siloso Beach,3,"It's an ok beach. Not very clean and very segmented, you can't go to certain places because it is part of restaurant or something and then on weekends, it's very crowded and people litter."
Siloso Beach,5,"Such a wonderful place to visit. Great beaches, food, and nightlife all nearby"
Siloso Beach,4,"It's pretty clean, nice to spend some time in the evening.. peaceful.."
Siloso Beach,4,"Given currently limited crowd its good,  but have to wait for long time sometime, without any indication of when you get to go in."
Siloso Beach,5,lovly
Siloso Beach,4,Was there during the grill feast! Other than the heavy smoke smell everything was great
Siloso Beach,5,"Pleasent and calm, the best way to reach is obviously using the cable car. The beach is very clean with low waves making it one of the best place to have a nice dip! Picturesque !"
Siloso Beach,5,"Clean beach, perfect place near singapore if you want something different from the city.
They provide free bus for going around the beach. But the price for food and attractions little bit expensive there."
Siloso Beach,4,Very nice place to chill and take a walk with your family and friends but will tend to be crowded during peak hours of the day.
Siloso Beach,4,Clean and a great place for seaside breeze. A good place to capture sunset
Siloso Beach,4,Going around the island and visiting beach to beach
Siloso Beach,5,I love the sea beach
Siloso Beach,5,My beautoful memery with myy
Siloso Beach,3,"Well I think that you really have to come with kids to enjoy it. Is man maid beach was the best part of it for me I felt that all of it is purposely maid to deprived you of you money without providing anything unique or special....
Madame tussauds seen it in London
Cable car same thing or any skiing destination and all seemed not all that good quality."
Siloso Beach,5,I love this beach! Great time with family well spent because of the great view and the staffs are good!
Siloso Beach,4,Nice beach to check out. A good place for family. I git off the cable car to check it out on the evening. Lovely.
Siloso Beach,4,Awesome place to R&R for the whole fsmily
Siloso Beach,5,Nice beach lots of activities cafes restaurants very relaxed area reminds me of being in Bali only you feel a lot safer and its a bit more expensive.
Siloso Beach,5,Really a beautiful beach but the best tip I can give to any reader is to plan your beach time in the cool early morning or the late evening because a afternoon beach time can bake you or bbq you
Siloso Beach,4,"Very pretty beach with a lot of facilities. You can soak up the sun on a hot day, bring sunglasses because it can be so glaring. And sunscreen too. It is also dog friendly, and my daughter loves playing with them."
Siloso Beach,4,Family friendly beach. You can step into the water without much apprehension. Lifeguards on duty. Water is calm and shallow. Foods and beverage places close by. A 7-11 is also about a 6min walk away.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful place. Beach kept clean. You can hire sunbeds from cafe. Have a bungyjump and zip wire. Sentosa certainly worth a visit. Went sued the cable car.
Siloso Beach,5,Nice place to stay and relax. Also one can engage in various activities and water sports
Siloso Beach,5,Nice beach. Very pleasurable to swim and relax. Good facilities for changing and lots of nice cafes nearby in which to relax.
Siloso Beach,3,Beach is ok with good sand however the sea looks so dirty that I doubt it's a good idea to get into the water
Siloso Beach,5,"Definitely will go back. Next time, i will bring my swimwear and some stuff for the beach. And what's more, its entrance is free."
Siloso Beach,5,"The usual stuff you see in a beach; the sands, the sky, the horizon, the sea, the shore, the cargo vessels floating all over the ocean, the resorts, dining places, public toilets, zip line, giant swing, bungy jumping towers, etc. But the only thing that makes this beach above the rest is its great location. Located at the world famous Sentosa Island in Singapore!"
Siloso Beach,5,Luv it but too expensive
Siloso Beach,5,"Clean beach, not much rush is there. If you are a adventurous person then bungy , zipline and sky swing are waiting for you here. A bit costly but worth trying.Evening time have food at beach side restaurants."
Siloso Beach,4,Lots to do
Siloso Beach,4,Wonderful beach for Singapore! The slides quite thrilling! A must beach to be at!
Siloso Beach,5,"You can easily spend 3 hours at this beach! Go till the island by walk with your mate, play Volleyball and chill!"
Siloso Beach,5,It's the best place for fun. Gets some drinks and enjoy the vibes
Siloso Beach,3,The biggest beach and the least natural.
Siloso Beach,5,"Neat and enjoyable, can't swim after 7PM, Wash Rooms available and food courts also there near beach station"
Siloso Beach,5,Siloso beach 🌹🥰what a nice place to relax
Siloso Beach,4,Cute place. But as any beach at Singapore and Sentosa not for swimming. I doubt to enter the water after watching crowds!!! all the heavy cargo ships parked around. First time saw trash around laying near attraction points and nobody was cleaning. In water also a bit
Siloso Beach,5,The place is a bit isolated but you really do not have to leave because so much happening on the island Hotel very helpful people great rooms
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice and relaxing,but during this days of pandemic,its quite boring and few people hanging around"
Siloso Beach,5,"This Beach Is Fantastic,but If you have any skin allergies or anything then don't go for swimming. This Is My Opinion..."
Siloso Beach,5,Toboggan & skyline luge Sentosa

Siloso Beach,4,Wonderful place to visit. Glad to be there during leisure holidays.
Siloso Beach,5,"Don't know about daytime, but evening time this the perfect place to chill out! Laying on the beach with cold ice-cream cocktail and rum, easy disco music on the background from the nearest open air club, only few people around and ships lights on the dark horizon! This is when you can feel happiness :D Try it!"
Siloso Beach,5,"Sea Water is clear, Beach & Restroom are clean. Transport is simply great with Bus 123. Sentosa bus also great. 👍👍👍👍👍"
Siloso Beach,5,"Lovely beach, plenty of beach bars. Free transport along the coast. We had a great time here"
Siloso Beach,5,"Beautiful beach and can be reach via a stop point in the Singapore Cable Car. Has assortment of activities like ziplining, base jumping. Has lots of nearby stores and 7-11 for a quick bite"
Siloso Beach,5,"From main building you just need to pass the street and you have reached the beach!SBR is claiming to have the longest natural pool with approx 90m length; after measuring it by feet, I came to approx 60m, but its still a lot :)  A very impressive waterfall is part of the pool as well."
Siloso Beach,5,Clean and neat beach and super food court in night time.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful place
Siloso Beach,4,One of the cleanest beach I've been to. The water is clean and blue and there are lifeguards after every 50 meters. Great place to visit with friends and family.
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice stretch of clean white beach with plenty of food, drinks, activities for young and old."
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice place to swim. I went in early October and was the only person in the beach (I like it), but it has facilities for a large number of people."
Siloso Beach,4,Good one. You can take a cable car and reach here easily and you can even see the Fort from the same point
Siloso Beach,4,"Sun, Sand and the Sea. Wonderful place to go if you're into the beach. Waters may not be clean due to passing vessels."
Siloso Beach,4,Fine sands and clean water. A decent place to chill in a summer day!
Siloso Beach,5,It's a very beautiful and clean public beach. There's a lot of activities around and lots of sights to see. There are also surrounding food places that are affordable. I'll have to go again next time I visit singapore.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful beach and nice chill out bars.
Siloso Beach,4,"Decent and peaceful place on weekdays. However sea water is not clean, so avoid swimming."
Siloso Beach,5,A nice beach. Good for long walks and peaceful. Nice views around.
Siloso Beach,4,Good but lot of resorts and hotels so this place lost its calm and serenity.
Siloso Beach,5,The beach is clean and nice to walk and watch the sunset. Enjoy your day at this beach with friends and beer!
Siloso Beach,4,Great looking beach. Water was warm. Life guards on duty. Pity about rubbish floating around.
Siloso Beach,5,A friendly place. Can have relaxed atmosphere. Lot of eatery around.
Siloso Beach,4,Nice place to sit beside sea. Not beautiful because of huge transport ships
Siloso Beach,4,"A good place to chill, have a sun tan and even have a meal. A picnic is a nice option when visiting. However, shade is limited, with palm trees scattered around, providing scant coverage. There are larger pavilions that save the day for most beach goers."
Siloso Beach,5,Siloso beach has many wonderful activities from time to time.Ideal place to hangout.
Siloso Beach,5,Beautiful location and really clean and great place for a long stroll!
Siloso Beach,5,"Came here for a gathering. Big sand area to play sports, sea there is salty. Relaxing atmosphere. Good place to just bond as a group."

Siloso Beach,5,Great place for sunset watching as it is not as crowded as other beaches that are closer to the Beach Station
Siloso Beach,5,Breathtaking beautiful! And offxourae one of the cleanest beach💎🥰
Siloso Beach,1,"typical beach resort , demanding money for seated areas , or have to order drink or food.

Siloso Beach,5,This Sentosa  station is good for adventure activities. You can also get into the beach.
Siloso Beach,4,Artificial Beach
Siloso Beach,5,One of the three beaches at sentosa. Really nice place that is well kept. A really good place to relax or have recreational activities with your family or friends although it's rather small.
Siloso Beach,4,Great place to relax and enjoy the beach with loved ones. If only there were more trees to provide shade.
Siloso Beach,5,Wonderful and should also visit that tiny island which is connected by a bridge from the beach.
Siloso Beach,5,Very clean beach in Singapore. Beautiful landscapes
Siloso Beach,4,"It is at the western end of the island so it is usually not as crowded as the other beaches. Shelters are located a distance away from the sea so it might get quite hot during the day. It is located near a toilet, shower and water dispenser so it is still fairly convenient.  The shuttle bus station is also right next to the cable car station behind the beach, providing you with multiple ways to return to the main areas if you wish."
Siloso Beach,3,"Actually this beach is not so special. They offer artificial entertainment. A lot of beaches are better than this, just come to indonesia! 😊"
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice place to relax, dine and unwind."
Siloso Beach,4,Was there for the Starwars sandsation. Very well done including intricate details. Only spoiler was the haze.

Siloso Beach,5,I prefer Siloso beach than Palawan beach
Siloso Beach,4,Good relaxing place and good atmosphere.
Siloso Beach,4,wow
Siloso Beach,5,"Singapore's premier stretch of beach. Bury your toes in to fine white sand as you enjoy an evening sunset on the lounge chairs of the beach clubs or just lay out a towel and have a magical evening with your loved one.

Waters are calm and clean. Enjoy a tan in the afternoon sun while playing beach games with your friends. Slap on the sunscreen though, it is going to be hot."
Siloso Beach,5,"Unbelievable beach, one of my best vacations"
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice place, very quit when I was there. Santos Island is the place to visit when In Singapore. Beaches, shopping, restaurants and bars. Aquarium not to be missed. A bit pricy but well worth the money"

Siloso Beach,2,"Thought it would be nice to go for a dip after an exceptionally hot walk up to Fort Siloso, unfortunately a lot of litter in the water from the ships."
Siloso Beach,4,"An interesting beach. First thing, do not expect your tropical Thai paradise. Yet, it still has something special, maybe it is the fact you can escape downtown and in 30/40 minutes reach this quiet corner of Singapore. By quiet, I mean by visiting on a weekday morning when there is hardly anyone about. I believe at weekends it can be pretty packed. We thoroughly enjoyed a couple of hours just relaxing, and watching the unusual phenomena of sitting on a beach and staring out at hundreds of ships all sat in the Straits of Singapore."
Siloso Beach,5,"Area. location and the scenery is extraordinary. Extremely superb
But a bad smell around the water area makes uncomfortable."
Siloso Beach,4,"Good place if u have enough time,good to visit here"
Siloso Beach,5,Mega Zipline..a must try!

Siloso Beach,5,Located within sentosa this beach is handmade but beautiful. A lovely space to bring the family
Siloso Beach,5,Great beach in Sentosa where you can see clear sea water. Enjoy your day at this beach.
Siloso Beach,5,"This is one of the cleanest beaches I have seen. However do note that this is an artificial beach and is man-made whose sand is imported from Australia.

Siloso beach has more facilities than the nearby Palawan beach as it has many water sports. It is  a nice place to relax, swim or watch the sunset. Do remember to take sunglasses and sunscreen as it tends to get very sunny. There are many stores nearby and even clean changing rooms are present."
Siloso Beach,5,Love the Beach very much. Nice relaxing
Siloso Beach,5,A place where you can relax or have fun with.
Siloso Beach,5,It is a beautiful place to spend time with family and friends. It is perfect for all age groups. Children has places to play and so do elderly people can relax on the beach.

Reach there early morning so you get a full day to enjoy.

Siloso Beach,5,Amazing peaceful beach...U feel awesome there...
Siloso Beach,5,"Siloso beach is very relaxing destination in Singapore. Very clean beach with nearby various other popular attractions of Singapore.

Lots of beach shacks to satisfy your hunger pangs and quench your thirst.
Neat, clean and well maintained public areas.👌
People are friendly and helpful."
Siloso Beach,4,"This is a small artifical beach on the Sentosa island and we were here to spend some time before the ""Wings of Time"" show. There were many tourists who I guess were from the nearby resorts. It can get crowded as the sandy area is limited. Beware of using the chairs as we need to pay for it and the renting costs are high."
Siloso Beach,5,Good during evening times as it will not be crowded
Siloso Beach,4,"Very nice beach, plenty of facilities"
Siloso Beach,5,"Nice beach, enjoyed Coastes"
Siloso Beach,5,"Cool beach, relatively safe with lifeguard on duty!"

Siloso Beach,5,Great
Siloso Beach,4,Should plan to visit in evening. Good place for relaxation.
Siloso Beach,5,"Loved it! There are so many activities to do at Siloso beach, such as the mega adventure, bungee jumping and looking at the beautiful Siloso fort!

Siloso Beach,4,Nice beach with fine sand and good breeze

Siloso Beach,3,"Water is super warm, beach sand is clean and soft, showers, toilets and change rooms are nearby. 3 stars because we got a lot of black marks on us (bitumen?) from the water. Would not enter that water again"
Siloso Beach,5,Love this place. Must visit if you have extra time in Singapore.
Siloso Beach,2,Do not expect a Thai like beaches. Sand is white and pure but the water looks dirty in my opinion. The ships look really close to the beach. Not a pleasant beach for swimming. I do recommend it for hanging around the beach or tanning.

Siloso Beach,4,Nice beach. Though it is bit untidy at times. But to be away from hustles and bustles of city it is a very good place.
Siloso Beach,5,"For beach activities this is the place. It was a bit crowded when I visited though. There's bungee jumping, zip lining, infinity body boarding, and many other activities to keep you occupied. Don't forget the sunscreen though, you will burn without it."

Siloso Beach,5,"Most safest place , easy to swim all"
Siloso Beach,5,Amazing beach first thing in the morning
Siloso Beach,3,The area to enjoy with zipline and bungy jumping...

Siloso Beach,5,Nice beach to cool or engage in sporting activities
Siloso Beach,5,"Beautiful beach lots of activities,resturannts,bars a must do if in Singapore"
Siloso Beach,4,Beautiful beach on Sentosa. But there's a bit of rubbish left on the beach along the shore
Siloso Beach,2,"A beach where you can see ships fairly close up - not everyone's cup of tea.  As beaches go in Singapore, the east coast is far better than Sentosa.  That said, this is a nice and super safe placid sandy stretch...good for very small children.   If you are a visitor to Singapore and want to enjoy a nice day out at the beach, then head to the East Coast instead."

Siloso Beach,2,"Nice on night, in the day you can see a lot of oil tanker not so far on the horizon"
Siloso Beach,2,"Very touristic place, the view on lots of container ships is also not very nice - There are much better places im Singapore to visit, than Sentosa Islan"
Siloso Beach,5,"Excellent Place to enjoy. You can bring young children who can play and enjoy in sandy beach also can swim. There are several activities you can do like hire a eco cycle and can glide around, can do bunzy jumping, can cross over one area to other with rope tied on your vest like a kite. Don't forget to try the coconut ice cream here. Also take the siloso beach tram to go to the other beaches, it is free and operates every 10 minutes. Although it is artificially built but can enjoy in swimming and kayaking."

Siloso Beach,3,"A decent sized beach, didn't seem to be too busy the handful of times that I went by.  Most people were like me, tourists.  Most Singaporeans do not want to be outside in the heat most of the day.  Came by for the new years party one year as well and it was fun with lots of stages.  But again, lots of tourists!"
Siloso Beach,2,Beach is fairly dirty and there is a oil slick on the water from all the boats offshore. Would not recommend getting in the water here. Maybe just sit on the fake beach and watch people try to use the water jet pack.

Activities from regular ol swimming, sunbathing, picnic, free movies, bungy jumps, mega zip line and the various events held throughout the year. Recently was having Sentosa Grill Fest with food booths selling mouthwatering food. Well you get the general idea. Getting there might be a bit tricky though, either need to walk (quite far to be honest), or use cable car service (quite pricey) or via Grab."

Siloso Beach,5,Very good.
Siloso Beach,4,"Clean sandy beach that was surprisingly not busy for a weekend. Only just dipped my toes in the warm water which was kept calm from the sea by the man made islands. There are patrolled swimming areas. Although a fun beach, this is not going to be one of the great beaches of the world as you look out past the islands to many, many container ships, the big cranes of the docks. As each ship moves off it belches out hugs plumes of black smoke and you wonder actually how clean the water is. At the top of the beach is a jumble of letters as a sculpture with the beach name, a photo spot for most of the tourists."

Siloso Beach,5,Lots of fun things to do!
Siloso Beach,1,"Filthy, just filthy. the float some contained a mix of plastic bags and cups,  going into the water is like stepping on a plastic bag tarp and sand. a sad state of a beach that tarnishes what was to be expected of Sentosa.  Even East Coast Park's beach was cleaner than this.

I really hope this place gets cleaned up especially considering it's the beach catering to Shangri-la sentosa resort."

Siloso Beach,4,"Wait to be away from the hustle & bustle of the city & wanna some peace,sand,sun,sound of a little bit of the ocean waves & close to mother's nature & tall shady trees...
This is the place for you to be pampered & spoiled....
But of cos if you wish to do some something you can always take the hotel's coach to Vivo City  which about 15mins ride
You can find everything there instead of going all the way to the main shopping belt in Orchard...."

Siloso Beach,5,"Apart from swimming, a lot of other activities like bungi jumping, mega jump, rope climbing, and zip lining, etc."

Siloso Beach,3,"It's fine if you don't mind huge tankers and transport ships seemingly just off shore.  Also, the sand here isn't ""fine"", I'd say it's closer to the size of sea salt.  But any beach on Sentosa will be like this.  If you came to Singapore to go to the beach...you're an idiot."

Siloso Beach,3,"Tanker views, fake rocks, imported sand, man made island,  nothing genuine there except pizzas"
Siloso Beach,4,"I instantly fell in love with Siloso, a perfect beach by all standards. Beautiful, from its white sand to its green blue water. Clean, calm and peaceful with watersports all around you.
I don't know if it always is like this, but as far as my experience goes, I found Siloso to be way better than Palawan. Palawan was crowded and noisy, whereas Siloso was moderately-empty and soothing. You hear the laughs of children rather than their screams, if so to speak.
All-around top notch, doesn't miss a beat, the tropical beach experience perfected."
Siloso Beach,5,"Beautiful spot, great beach!"
Siloso Beach,5,Peaceful beach nice and quiet. Great pizza

Siloso Beach,5,Clean beach
Siloso Beach,4,"Nice place for a family outing with beaches and facilities. It is a 5 minute walk from the sentosa monorail siloso station. The waters are nice for swimming and i guarantee you will enjoy yourself there. Especially on sunnday days. There are many attractions there to be found such as the luge ride where you travel down hill on a small vehicle, the cable car where you can see the whole of Singapire's central business district, and fort siloso where you can take a trip back in time to 1942 when Japan invaded Singapore. There are lots of services around such as bike and segway rental shops. They also provide stroller rentals should you need them. The area is definitely wheelchair accessible with lifts and ramps situated throughout the area. And if you want to grab a quick bite there are multiple fnb stores at siloso beach such as macdonalds and a gelato shop. The prices for the items there can be slightly overpriced thus i would not reccomend buying things from siloso beach. Overall if you love the beach and love to play in the sand, siloso beach is the perfect place for you. And whats more, the entrance fee is free!"

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Lovely nature walks. You can look over to Malaysia. Very popular with bird watchers.
We didn't see any crocodiles, but according to the warning signs, there are some.
Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and snacks. There is a vending machine at the visitor center, but with limited choice."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Can’t believe it’s Singapore!! Saw hugging lizards. Guess if they were mating or wrestling 😉 cute flying fish greeted us as well. Didn’t see crocs and other wildlife, but the nature and tranquility around was 😍 (portions of the trek are closed - FYI)"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"What a truly fascinating place ! We drove up here not exactly sure what to expect but the place really surprised us with its characteristics. The wetland has a lot of interesting points of interest and if you like exploring the outdoor spaces then this must be in one of your must visit places. They say people have spotted alligators / crocodiles in the wild - though we weren’t that lucky. We did spot some wild bats 🦇 and various other creatures. The mud flipper was one such interesting salamander. You can see Malaysia across the straits of Johor / Singapore straits, which was quite cool."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Lively and lovely place . I am glad that Singapore is turning this nature land to more accessible for people to visit.
Unfortunately there is tons of rubbish at the wetland . This is not because Singapore is not cleaning the park but they comes from the ocean . I think picking the rubbish might be challenging because of the mangrove roots .
Hopefully one day the selfish people can stop littering …"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place for a long walk fully immersed in nature. Wild vegetation, many spots for bird watching and, if lucky, crocodiles too. Highly recommended, perfectly served with parking lots and bus stops. Early morning time recommended."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It's a great place to escape the city's hustle and bustle. Easy to treak
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice afternoon walk, surrounded by wild life of the non-dangerous sort... As long as one stays on the walking path and don't do stupid things.
My first visit after years of procrastinating because I thought it was too far away.
My first lesson about migratory birds: why there aren't many in July/Aug. 🤦"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Was raining during the hike but a nice  tranquil experience. Happen to find two monitor lizards and a crocodile. Also a strange paranormal experience of hearing chanting which can cannot be traced.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very great wetland reserve. Sad that we didn't see any crocodile. Amazing friendly staff at the smaller visitor center.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place to have a jogging or nature walk. The combination of sea view and forest. Not crowded. Breathe fresh air. A lil bit far and remote, driving to the location is recommended. Nearby there is a nice restaurant (Bistro) to chill out. They sell many beautiful plants and house decoration too. Good place for family outing!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Like the coastal trail so much. Definitely a nice place to trek. Suitable for family. Picnic is prohibited here in the reserve so please do not bring picnic food unless some bite to eat to prevent hungry as you need to keep hydrate and energy to walk around.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Love the nature. Currently one stretch is under repair, reopen in March 2022."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"The drive there itself is so amazing. Plenty of carpark lots. (There are bus services to the entrance to.)
No further info. Have fun exploring!!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lovely nature park with wetland, wildlife and sea"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A free wetland reserve, which is across the sea with Malaysia. The scenery and experience are great, but the location is far away from downtown, only NO.925 bus can reach the entrance. There are many animals but you need to be very careful to find them."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice weather are walking under the trees in the morning, suitable bringing kid's to here for looking natural habitats. Our s'pore🇸🇬 natural unearth a world filled with rich biodiversity park.
🌳🌱🌿🍃🍂🐜🐛🐿️🐊🐦🦎🕊️🐌🦋"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"One of our all-time favourite nature hangouts. The migratory bird trail is a short and easy trail for adults and kids. Keep a lookout for estuarine crocodiles, migratory and resident birds, monitor lizards, squirrels, dog-faced fruit bats and snakes. If heading to the mangrove trail, remember to apply mosquito repellent."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Very nice structure pavement for the hikers!
Sign board clarity can be improved."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Weather was amazing. Saw a croc!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Easy access with car and public bus. Can see crocodiles during low tide. I saw otter, big monitor lizard on the walking path, big crocodile (famous tailess croc), mud skipper, flamingo, turtle, fish, etc."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Our first time to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve on a Monday afternoon to avoid crowds.  It was very quiet and peaceful trail at 5plus.

Note: only bus to go there during weekdays is bus 925.

Going there during weekdays are quite inconvenient and inaccessible as walking will take you hours to arrive, so we took a taxi in.

The trail is very peaceful and quiet perhaps the time is quite short for us, saw squirrels 🐿 but didn’t caught any sight of crocodile and other reptiles.🐊 it’s a pity.  Would want to explore again next time."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Sungei Buloh is one of my favourites nature park. It's a good place to see monitor lizard, migrate birds, mud skippers, and crocodile if you are lucky. It is one place where I would visit a few times a year!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Worth a visit for educational purposes. Nice for a family outing and bird/animal spotting. Lucky to spot 2 crocodiles on my first visit.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A great day to take a break to immerse into Mother Nature on Father day. Happy Father day to every father out there!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A very nice place for nature lovers and wildlife photographers. Lots of endemic species can be spotted here, including bats, monitor lizards, crocodile and even king cobra. It is also one of the main habitat for migratory birds and there are a lot of hideout built for long range photography."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A good place for nature lovers but better bring your water bottles as there are no facilities nearby 😃
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice and quiet place, especially in the early morning."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"It’s quite remoted but considered as accessible as it can be reached by public transport. It looks very big from the map, but it’s quite fast to walk from one end to another end.

I went to the coastal trail to be on those observation pod. The iconic kingfisher pod is on this trail too. I got to take a lot of instagrammable pics and managed to see the crocodile and some birds.

The mud experience was closed due to maintenance. So bad. I wanted to walk on the net bridge.

After you reached the wetland center, you can continue to walk to the wetland to watch birds. It was raining suddenly so I didn’t proceed.

Make sure to bring your water and food, also take away your rubbish before leave. I saw some rubbished on the bush. It’s bad for the environment as some materials are not bio degradable and wild animals might consume them and kill themselves. Please be considerate."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Abundant in different animals and plants. Great views of wildlife and many trails to explore.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,This is a very popular bird photography place amongst the photography enthusiasts in Singapore. Migratory birds escapinht form harsh winter would stop over here before heading south to Indonesia.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice for a morning walk, walked from the visitor centre (sungei buloh wetland reserve extension) to the wetland centre, looped around the migratory bird trail, and back to the visitor centre. In total approx 3.5h, started at 7.30am. Spotted crocodiles, monitor lizards, mudskippers, various bird species. Went in August, but recommended to visit Sept-Mar during the migratory period to see more wildlife. The extension is wheelchair friendly although the main wetland area not as much. Take note, the pathway along the migratory bird trail is sandy.

Would be nice to catch the sunrise here, along with a view of malaysia right across (eagle point lookout area)"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Be prepared to walk alot, spent 2-3 hrs here to cover the entire park and even spotted some crocodiles!

However this place is very inaccessible so when leaving, do check out the shuttle bus timings! Else it'll be a long walk out to the main road to take a bus 😅"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"If you have more time go to migratory bird path. However went to the forest track and its manageable for two young kids. They were excited to see mudskippers , crossing the hanging bridge, identifying small creatures along the way. Too bad there are lots of trash swept away from the sea that stuck between mangrooves."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to visit with your family to enjoy nature.

Plenty of wildlife if you're lucky, and equally as many nature photographers waiting around to capture it's beauty.

Do watch out for spiders in the branches and the occasional monitor lizards.

There's a great lookout hut overlooking Johor."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Visited Sungei Buloh wetland with my family. It was a lovely walk in the park that my kids managed to see iguana, bats, crocodile and many more small.animals and fishes. There are also many wild flowers and insects in the woods. Parking was convenience and free. Remember to bring along water, cap and insect repellent. These will come in handy."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Was pretty crowded on a Sunday morning but such a fun place to explore! There are a few trails to explore. Lots of unique birds to see, as well as monkeys, crocodiles, spiders and other animals. But they don’t bother you so not to worry."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Had a great, chill stroll along the various trails available in the evening. Come during low tides and give yourself 3 to 4 hours if you want to slowly check out all the viewing hides/platforms and spot wildlife!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Highly recommend arriving just before opening time (7 am) if you want to avoid crowds. Great for a walk or birding. Paths are well defined. There is no concession here so bring water. Great for the photography of migratory birds. You need a 400mm lens or more. Watch for the crocodiles. We saw a couple of them. We also saw eagles and egrets and kingfisher.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very good walk. I saw quite a few kodomo dragons, a green snake, bird spices and butterflies."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Really amazing place in Singapore to visit for a nature retreat. Air is fresh and the trails offer so much to see and explore! This place has lots of wildlife and we were lucky to catch a few of those including the more popular ones like the birds and reptiles living in the reserve.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Bountiful of wildlife to be seen in this nature park.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"What an adventure!

So raw. So pure. So natural.

I have been wanting to visit Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve for ages. I made it today finally! I felt like I was travelling out of SG.

NParks is doing a great great job of preserving the nature at its best. THANK YOU!

From the well-maintained landscape, mangrove areas, bird viewing areas, cleanliness of public areas, all can't be possibly done without the thorough planning and the dedication of the workers - Your truly foreign workers for their good work.

A highly recommended place to explore if you love nature. It was like stepping into the not-so-Singapore side of Singapore overseeing Malaysia.

Nonetheless, the Reserve might not be the best place for young kids if they are scared of the sound of nature, sights of wild animals, forestry landscape, to name a few.

We spotted so many wild plants and of course wild animals as well.

Reminder:

1) There's only one way in and out within the Reserve unless you walk along the main road. So, please plan ahead - your route and your energy level.

2) FREE shuttle bus service available during PH and weekends.

3) Choose your car park based on your need - bird viewing or mangrove trails to save you time and energy

4) Bring an umbrella or a stick. I felt safer

5) Check the weather

6) Check the tide - it determines what you might want to see

You're welcome 😊"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Slow down your foot step to look around for surprise encounter. Best to start your trail in the morning.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A very quiet place with lots of small animals
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Singapore's no.1 nature reserve. Too good miss... perfect for nature lovers. Go early and enjoy the walking trails, enjoy nature but also 'swampland"" odour at certain area. Don't forget sunblock, water and mozzie repellent. You will want come back again and again."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Enjoy the greenery & fresh air. Watch the crocodile and birds while looking at JB @another side of strait. Feel like just one step far away. Hopefully can go to JB soon.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Come early, enjoy the walking trails. The eastern park has built up walkways and features like the Kingfisher Pod. Gets a good view of the straits. The western part are the tidal ponds which would take an hour to loop around. Some public members may be noisy which would inhibit birds and animals, so avoid them if you want to observe and pick out their calls."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful backdrops for photo taking and good routes to walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"By far the best “untouched” nature park in Singapore. Many trails to explore, great for family with kids."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nature, fresh air, quiet and peaceful with birds singing."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Well maintained trails suitable for all types of hikers. Numerous viewing pods and observation decks along the trail to take in the abundant wildlife. Came across a big monitor lizard along the way.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,You can enjoy a peaceful day out with your loved ones. Great place for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts alike. Might be a bit inaccessible for those without cars.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Enjoyed trekking through the coastal trail and the main reserve, as well as taking photos with my aunt at points of interest!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,This is the new area. Nice broadwalk. Do go early if you want to avoid the sun.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Walks are nicely marked. Lots of wildlife to look out for. Good info on flora and fauna. Very educational and well laid out.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Love this place... gets us close to nature.. had a great time following kms of trails
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very nice place for a morning walk close to the nature and fresh air. Now even easier with their recent park connector upgrade.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Is a great place to go to see sunrise
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice scenery with lots of animals to see. Only thing is it can be a bit hot when the sun is out. Otherwise just hope for wind. Can see mangroves, storks, herons, owls, monitor lizards, crocodiles, spiders, other birds."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It’s a nice quiet place for nature lover, it’s not that hot even on a sunny days. Can see many salt water crocodiles if you are lucky enough."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,1,"I personally prefer going to MacRitchie. So unless you stay in the North, it’s probably not worth the trip there as it’s so far away! The place is so isolated that you don’t feel like you are in Singapore. Should you go, it’s best to combine with a visit to the farms to make the trip worth the time travelled."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It was a wonderful walk from the wetland Visitor centre to the Wetland reserve. Would recommend for a short half day trip.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Kranji gets busy on weekends with cyclists. Early AM there's already a crowd. Easy to find (brown signs), unique mangroves and if you're into birdwatching or nature photography, a nice environment. Monitor lizards and if you're lucky, crocs! Aussie friend's tip: if chased, zig zag. They can't turn quickly!. Lovely morning out. Poignant view of Johor Bahru - a distant memory but oh so close.."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A therapeutic walk that is away from the usual bustling city and crowded Park Connectors. A good respite time to immerse yourself in Mother Nature.

But of course, be careful of crocodiles and other reptile creatures. After all, this is their home."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great day trip option if you want to lose the CBD hustle and bustle. There are clear walking paths so you don't have to worry too much about getting dirty (except for a few unpaved sections).

There are a lot of good spots for pictures. Plan to spend two to three hours if you want to see all of the reserve."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Great place for nature walks. But I don’t recommend coming on weekends and public holidays as it can get crowded
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It was sunny morning and pleasant to walk with the kids. Nice view from this eagle viewing point to see the wild animals not in cages.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Awesome place to look for crocodiles or birds. Inspired me to take up photography again. Be sure to read up on proper safety in encountering crocodiles, the sightings here are daily and they have been known to come up on to the foot paths."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Best Place to spend a day walking and enjoying nature. Lots to see. Bring water and insect repellent.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice.. Weather was cool with rain.. Real wetland experience.
Spotted a crocodile too.. Need to be cautious since it could climb to the walkways."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"This section of SBWL has many places for bird watching. It’s nice to walk around the wetland and be able to see the egrets, a crocodile (resting) and water monitor lizard (having lunch). Nice place to bring children to enjoy the outdoor in Singapore."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Crave to get closer to nature? This is a must visit for all to understand biodiversity in Singapore. Wide range of mangrove flora, migration birds & wild life (otters, jumping fishes, hornbills, monkeys, monitor lizards, crabs & etc) can be spotted at different time of the year. Awesome hiking  place for family or group of friends to explore & experience nature. 3-4 hours visit time should be planned excluding transportation/ travel time.
The Park is under going upgrading with new walkway being pathed. This does not affect the park visit. Weather can get quite warm & humid. Drink plenty of water the night before and bring bottled water, cap/ hat, towel & raincoat for sudden rainfall. Enjoy the hike, listen to the nature calls & keep your eyes opened for nature surprises :)"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A great effort by The NParks towards curating Singapore’s “City in Nature” refreshed image. More can be done to continue the effort to “polish up” the Wetland Reserve: Solving the problem of Coastal Debris being washed ashore seems a valid IMMEDIATE CONCERN! Organise programmes to clean up the Reserve by collecting Coastal Debris may well be the top actionable effort to build forward!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nothing much to add, excellent experience. Excellently maintained. They are always upgrading here. Love the place and visit very very often.
A tip for visitors, arrive very early. Weather is cool and you can walk around comfortably."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very nice out door relaxing place in Singapore.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,An easy exploratory walk for everyone of all ages and abilities. Plenty of wild flora and fauna to spot. Look out for the resident alligator too.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Well maintained. Many renovation and refurbishment activities to make this nature park be even better. There is a public bus 925M from Woodlands during Sunday/ Public Holiday. They also provide free shuttle bus during weekends and Public Holiday from Kranji MRT station.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very nice place to visit and have a very relaxing walk. Saw two crocodiles on our walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"On a hot weather make sure you have a sun hat, sunblock and mosquito repellent. Be aware of where you walk and steps, as you will easily encounter monitor lizard, snakes, spiders and croc. Great place to view migrating birds into the area. Make sure you have bags for garbage as bins not easily accessible in the area, not to forget to mention your drinking water. Grab a map to find Yr nearby public toilet and access to vending machine for beverage n snacks."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Witnessed the wildlife despite the rain on New Year’s Day. Learnt about migratory species that fly across Asia Pacific region.

Heard from a park regular about Tail-less the crocodile, aka the ‘mascot’ of the park who’s pretty known to visitors and regulars. Tail is thought to have been lost in a fight. A strong crocodile which has survived for 12 years and counting.

Photos: a young monitor lizard having its feast on a decaying fish, migratory birds having a rest on the sand bank"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"The one place that is very close to the nature. A morning of just walking in silence and observing the peace of mother nature. Its tranquil is very soothing to the soul, and body. Seeing all the beings like birds, fish, and squirrel teaches us of the freedom. On a fine lucky day you might catch a glimpse of the crocodiles there. Its amazing..."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It is a nice and easy walk (2 hours) that suits people of different ages. We spotted some exotic animals including a salt water crocodile. There are hide-outs to observe migratory birds which is around from Sept to March. It is highly educational for kids.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Awesome place to see wild Singapore crocodiles. Had 2 sightings of 2 crocs during my visit. Well organised park. Only problem was inadequate parking....
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It’s great day trip, can find crocodiles in nature"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,So beautiful!! Good to bring mosquito repellent but please don’t overspray it...didn’t spot the legendary crocodile but many cute snakes! Can’t wait to visit it again!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,love this place! good for a ~9km hike with plenty of things to see. saw a number of animals in the brochure on a good day. maybe because it was rainning the night before.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Sunny but it's worthit.. Enjoy
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very nice place. Able to see lots of different birds and creatures. I love the place and will be back more often.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice coastal walk with opportunity to see interesting wildlife, a heron, a crocodile, mud skippers and all."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of my favourite nature park - lot of fauna to spot. Beautiful landscape during high tide and lots of waterbirds during low tide. And of course fauna typical for a wetland from mudskippers to horseshoe crabs to monitor lizards. And watch out for those crocs :-)
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good place for Brisk Walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,An adventurous place to find the board beware from crocodiles sets the stage. Though it is very safe to walk on the designated walkways. The view from the pods is very nice. Wetlands can spot some new birds and fauna. If your are lucky you can spot eagles
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Good place for weekend trekking. There is designated pathway in the park and few exhibition centres for the ecology and wetland culture.

Bring umbrella / rain coat as there are limited shelters in park"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Monitor Lizard crossed my path when walking on path. Interesting encounter. Saw the large size crocodile 🐊 too.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Best place to hike and enjoy wildlife in this space! I wished I stayed around the corner.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Tranquil greenery, wild animals like Otters, Crocs, Monitor lizards, mud crabs, owls and other migratory birds.

Sea, swamp, lots of great lookout points and view of Malaysia's coastal line."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice area for leisure walk. I guess it's a great place to explore with family (especially when you can show young children on wild life animals like crocodiles and various types of birds). Seen quite lot of people bringing professional bird viewing equipment for the birds here. was lucky today to be able to catch a view of crocodiles and eagles.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"I love going to this reserve! You are one with nature and close encounters with crocodiles, snakes, monitor lizards, migratory birds, and alot more."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Didn't really get the chance to explore the whole area but I think it's very nice place to come embrace the nature. I will definitely be back.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice nature walk with lots of interesting creatures around... Spending 2 to 3 hours to enjoy the wonderful scenery 😍🐦🐊🦇🌿🌾
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lovely place, peaceful and serene.

Managed to spot a croc at the very end of the trip when tide was going down!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Must go. Singapore's wildest open concept Jungle Safari. Open your eyes. Look for nature. You will be surprised that many hidden animals watching you.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Went there on Sat morning, was really quite crowded. It's easy path, good for beginner. Pretty scenery. I did not get to see crocodile though 😅"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Love nature? Come visit this place.
There's a lot of amazing things to see and learn ."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A good place to touch nature, especially mangrove. Take mrt to kranji stop and take bus 925. There are four routes and coast line has onion-like buildings. On my way to wetland, I saw monkeys, giant mudskipper, crabs. Some places are still under construction. A good place for weekends and friends."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice place for easy hike .. lot of birds and reptile 😍.
Amazing experience. Kids will love this hike . Less people on weekends can enjoy peace hike. Not recommend hike alone. Those using bus transportation you have to return back to kranji way bus stop. 😉"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A nice place to hike for the family. Manage to catch some birds and small animals in the wetland area. It was also very near to JB. We could see the high rise from there.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice nature walk! About 2-3 hours for the whole reserved park. A lot of trees so the walk paths are shaded, a good and refreshing bonding for families and friends."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Wetland Reserve with great biodiversity. Spend some time exploring the trails, spotting and learning about the animals, insects and mangrove trees. Guaranteed to have a great time being so close to nature."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Started at 10am. Luckily it was quite shady with lots of trees. Took me about 2.5hrs to complete walking the entire park. Saw Crocodiles, monitor lizard, monkeys, fishes, stray dogs and big spiders along the way especially at the wetlands. Enjoyed myself very much."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A bit humid, recommend go earlier in the morning. Great place for viewing different types of birds and lizards/crocodiles. Also have a good view"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Really pleasant 2hr trail between the trees and marshland. Get a clear view of Malaysia across the Sg straits and look out for some animal sightings!

It’s a 1.3km trek from the further car park towards the wetlands and another 2km loop trail. Trails are well paved, flat and senior friendly."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to visit in the morning 🌄😀
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"I was the first to enter when the gate opened at 7am and enjoyed the serenity.
Beautiful sunrise, the sound of nature, the forest bathing is awesome!
This place would be perfect if is not so manicured.
Insect repellent is a must.

But I won’t say the same once it past 8am.
The crowd start coming in, noisy big group and it just ruin your experience.
Despite the ambassador around, people are still forming their own big group more than the allowed size."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Amazing walking path with many dedicated area for brief watching.
Drinking water available.
Mostly shady areas.
Went on Wednesday not much crowd.
By bus: bus stop closeby to the entrance but return you have to walk along the same route to catch the bus. That’s the most tiring part."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Escape the city and embrace nature. Go early if u want the the whole pod to yourself for photos. We reached about 7am and still pretty empty and the sunrise hue warms the photo...
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place to go with your kids. You can see birds, snakes, fish, frogs. Sometimes you can see crocodiles."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to visit outside the concrete jungle of Singapore. Can watch sunrise if you are able to reach there early before 7. Watch eagles fishing along the seashore. Those who appreciate Mother Nature would not regrets to visit this place.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A great place for morning brisk walking. Hope we can push through this Covid-19 soon!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,green n wild.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A relaxing place to go, great view, and plenty of directory panel along the path. Only downside is bunch dead fishes and rubbish float along the lumnitzera walk."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,lots of wildlife;) saw 3 crocs in one day. a great place to relax and away from the hustle and bustle of the city
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Splendid nature park/reserve to bring the family for a bit of nature spotting. Total track distance of about 4 km. Managed to spot crocodile, monitor lizards, mudskippers and a variety of other  mangrove fauna and flora.

A bit crowded on weekend due to Singaporean not being able to travel."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Perfect place for mangrove lovers. Also a good place for IG phototaking lovers as there are lots of unique designed huts/structures
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of the place that you can hear crickets in broad daylight. A nice view of Johore and natural swamps and wildlife. Saw a monitor lizard while walking in the park. There are bored watchers with the long lenses trying to snap pics of migratory birds feeding at the swamp lands. A must go at least once in a lifetime for Singaporeans.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is really an awesome place to go. However, ps be more considerate n follows the rules. Don't eat or bring food here, as the scent will attract the wild animals..If you love nature, this is one of the best n coolest place to venture"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is first time for us here. Saw migratory birds, mudskippers and crocodiles. Definitely a great place to visit over the holiday."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Quiet and chilly nature reserve, very “walk-able” from end to end with short and well maintained trails / walkways."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"With much to see, it’s one of the most popular birding spots here! Crocodiles have been known to wander onto the walking trails so keep a lookout!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for a weekend stroll. Not strenuous at all. Its nice to see the mudskippers flopping around in the mud. You can see across the strait to Malaysia and see the sea gulls looking for fish.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very nice place for bird watching. The path is a loop of 2.3 km and there are several observation points and an observation tower for you to watch for migratory and non migratory birds. If you're lucky you'll be able to spot a crocodile or two
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One major part is closed for reno. But otherwise it was quite deserted today 21 May. Lots of egrets n monitor lizards
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Beautiful scenes but very crowded on the weekends.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Wonderful place for dates/family outings/light exercise/change of pace. This place is simply amazing, all for the low low price of $0.00. There's all kind of animals there, horseshoe crabs, hornbills, crocodiles, mudskippers, golden orbweaver spiders, monitor lizards are just a few that I spotted within my two trips here so far. Be sure to pack some water, insect repellent, and an umbrella in case dark clouds start looming while you're there. Also be sure to hold onto your hat at some of the more open areas as the breeze can be pretty amazing. Do be sure to read through the park rules to make sure this reserve continues to be a wonderful place for future generations."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful and lovely place for a morning walk. 😃
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,No crowd. Highly recommended for couples and families.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice View! 👌Good place for morning walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Perfect for taking a breather on the weekends with your family and friends. The reserve is clean and is home to many of Singapore's local wildlife! If you're lucky, you'll be able to spot crocs too! SMM is required and NParks/Social Distancing Ambassadors will be around. So keep yourself and the people around you safe by keeping on your mask!
There are vending machines for drinks around, so do not fret!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Be prepared to walk on unpaved roads. It consists of two parts. One thing that irritates me the most more than the mosquitoes are the noisy people, especially aunties and uncles there. Feel free to ask them to keep quiet as it is part of the rules to maintain a low sound level. Nice hides and observation screens for viewing. Bring a binoculars as the birds are still pretty far from the watching areas. Recommended to go during low tide so check the tide timings on that day."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Nice place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice View ❤️
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Beautiful scenery and well kempt. You can see crabs, birds and mud skippers too. The walk is suitable for kids."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's really amazing to discover the beauty and wonders of Nature at Singapore’s first ASEAN Heritage Park. It's uncover a world filled with rich biodiversity as you wander through the wetlands with an extensive mangrove forest of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.

You can cover many trails and discover its native inhabitants such as mudskippers, crabs, shellfish, water snakes, birds, spiders, monitor lizards and otters. Admire the beauty of resident birds such as herons, kingfishers and sunbirds.

I took public transport to reach there..
Go to Kranji MRT Station then take bus 925 from there. It will drop you at Kranji Reservoir Carpark B then walk across the road to the Visitor Centre...

Enjoy! 😀"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A very pleasant morning at Sungei Buloh. Took a cab to the wetland dropoff point and did a round around the wetland. Saw crocodiles, otters, fishes, tortoise, squirrels and birds. There was little people around early morning and we spent time to soak within nature.

Was a return visit from many years back. Glad that it is very well-maintained and much improved. We ended the trip with the the seaside route towards the visitor center as the endpoint, where we took bus back to Kranji MRT.

Highly recommended. There were barely any slopes and very family-friendly. Do remember to bring insect repellent and sunblock, binoculars for bird watchers and maybe a camera to capture some moments with your loved ones."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Good place to walk, just be careful of the crododiles"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Surround by natural beauty of sea and mangrove. Good for a long stroll morning and late afternoon. Among the sea creatures,  look out for mud slippers, crabs and small fishes. Sea birds are abundant from around and johore. Try spotting migratory birds from northern n southern spheres. Please look out for crocodiles and larger animals."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good to experience nature..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good for families to walk around

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Well maintained. Easy walking wetland park...  Able to spot crocodile; various birds; squirrels etc..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Visited on weekday & had a pleasant stroll through the reserve. It was relatively empty on weekday morning which was great. Observed many monitor lizards, crocodiles, and migratory birds. Took us 4h for our hike and we haven’t even managed to finish the entire park. Entered the wetland reserve which took us 1h around the entire circle which was pretty tiring. Nice structures around for photography :)
Took a bus 925 from Kranji mrt."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"If you want to sight a crocodile in its natural habitat Sungei Buloh is the place to visit. Plus it’s a paradise for migratory birds due to its marshland landscape, which pulls in a lot of photographers from around.

We reached very early to avoid the crowd. The place has been well maintained since I had visited last and I hope it is continued that way. The place is famous for its mudskippers and they are quite easy to spot, so look out for them.

There are 3 trails around the Reserve and one of them shares the view of Malaysian skyline which is beautiful.

Definitely a recommended place to visit and spend good time with friends and family alike. And don’t forget to put on your sunblock 🧴."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice place and one of the least man made one I've seen here in Singapore. The pathway is made to complete the nature, not to disturb it. Lots of interesting facts and mostly plants to discover - as naturally animals are mostly shy (other than herons and bugs) - and that's how it should be (you probably don't really want a crocodile crossing your path). There are small vending machines at both entrances and toilets so no worries comfort wise."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Good for exercise, young or old. Suitable for families too. Great scenery"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very refreshing outing.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This place was amazing! Loads of animals, nice walk, views of the jungle and Malaysia, feels like you are on a trip away from home right in your back yard. Plenty of amenities to get water and food if needed. Go and enjoy the afternoon."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,The great outdoors
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A place where you can get close to nature and even catch a glimpse of a crocodile or two. Well made paths and trails.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A haven for birdwatchers and to spy on the occasional crocodile in the swamps. Trails were clearly marked and perfect for walks.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Beautiful place, fully sheltered by plants."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to explore nature. The whole walk is about 3 hours if walking leisurely.

There are two carparks. If you want to explore the newer side with the coastal walk, park at carpark along kranji way. Think there is a bus that stops at near this carpark also.

If exploring the migratory birds area, park at neo tiew crescent carpark.Last spotted the crocodile at the migratory birds side where the river connects to the sea.

Remember to bring insect repellent!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful place   will comeback soon again.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,beautiful.!! Love the nature of scenery.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wonderful place to explore on natural
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Always a pleasure to explore nature in crowded Singapore
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful park to walk. You can spot some white birds during the evening when the tide is low near the platforms.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,The coastal walk has great views across to jb and the wetland has hides where you can watch the birds. A great walk to do in the morning.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Look at the bats sleeping... Got to enjoy place with kiddos. Watch out for the crocodile though
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to spend time with your family and friends. Mostly flat well constructed footpath with lots of trees to provide shade. Stay quiet and observe your surroundings and you may spot a crocodile or snakes well blended in the nature.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"We came early and spent 2:30 hours to walk both trails, seeing lots of wild animals. Crowded after 10:00AM when we left there on Sunday."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful and close to nature. Revamped with a few interesting features to enhance the experience.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nature park with freshest of air, surrounded by water. Didnt managed to spot crocs or any other nature animals apart from too many humans on visiting on a public holiday."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Had a great walk at Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve. Saw crocodile, bats, monitor lizard, snakes, birds and squirrel. Quite a lot of animals in a day 😊"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Always love to visit Sungei Buloh, one of the few places one can come close to nature in Singapore. You may be able to catch a glimpse of crocodile or some exotic birds if you are lucky !"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is my second time at Sungei Buloh since circuit breaker restrictions has been eased. I wanted to go back to catch a glimpse of the crocodile after I saw a hiker spotted it and posted it on social media.

Today was a great day! and I spotted two crocodiles at the wetland reserve! What a lucky day!~ Spotted one five minutes into my trek and was surprised to see it hiding under a shade.

There are pros and cons of going on a Sunday morning. It is expected to have more visitors on Sundays as families bring along their children for a hike, and maids were there doing their photo shoots maskless (hmmm)... However, the advantage is that since many people are trekking and looking out for animals, they will be able to point out these animals and you will be able to enjoy the fun too.

It is understandable that visitors at the reserve will not be able to observe the one meter social distancing rules as it was really crowded this morning with many children and families. I'm perfectly fine with that as some of the trails and platforms are narrow and it is impossible for all visitors to observe that. If you are conscious of social distancing, weekends might not be the right time of you."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place to experience the nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Very nice to visit the rural parts of Singapore, breath fresh air.
Also about as close to JB as your can get this period, lol"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,2,Feel like nothing much to see except for bird gazing. Crocodile need to wait for maybe high tide. Transportation is limited by 925 or kranji express. This place reminds me of BMT field camp. Kids like it though. Lots of same pear building(my kids call it) scattered throughout.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great experience to back to nature! Not rocky path as treetop and takes almost 2hrs to complete the leisure walk.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A great nature reserve full of wild life that we can observe in a safe and comfortable environment.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Worth a visit, managed to spot a crocodile floating around, do take precautions against mosquitoes. Recommend early morning due to heat."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Saw 3 crocodiles for the first time today.

Not sure why 1 place have 2 locations on google.

Would be great if they can keep the fdw in control as they are eating/picnic in a wildlife free roam area. And this can get dangerous for them and future visitors."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very peaceful and nice view.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A very beautiful place to hike with the family and friends. It's quite far from the city but it's worth the travel.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice walking park to explore....Scenery perfect  !!!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's not exactly a huge nature reserve but for the size of Singapore its decent. Likely bump into monitor lizards sun tanning, species of birds and maybe some rare seen animals?"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"We met crocodile today! The Coast trail more beautiful than Bird trail, but the bird trail more interesting"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Didn't know Singapore got wild crocodile. Awesome!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,The place just opposite with johor oversea.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"I’m so glad we still have places like this in Singapore, where it still feels like ‘nature as it is’. Walking the whole loop took about <50mins (~2km) in total

Lots of egrets and herons doing their own thing in their natural habitat, a very pleasant sight! if you’re lucky, you might get to spot a crocodile 🐊, lots of monitor lizards roaming around nonetheless if you would like some of the reptile action 👊🏻 also plenty of fish swimming in the waters and a nice view of JB on the other side. A shame to see quite a bit of trash lying around.

4 stars mainly cause this isn’t a place I would specially visit. Just happened to want to take a cycling trip out with some friends. P.S. starting early at 7am is highly recommended"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place for sightseeing,phototaking or just tracking to have glimpse of wildlife in the area.Crocs (if you lucky), hornbill,bats,monitor lizards,monkeys
Alot mosquitoes,put mosque repellent"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Mangroves place , you can see some migrants birds if you are lucky"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A natural place to relax and enjoy the environment.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A nice nature place to walk with family. If you are lucky u will manage to catch a glimpse of crocodile and monitor lizard.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Very nice place for breeze walking.

Just needed to beware of wild dangerous animals like crocodies.

Do bring along $1 coins in case u need tp buy  drinks at the vendoring machine."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A great place to see and learn about nature and mangroves wetlands. And so we saw the birds, squirrels, spiders, giant mudskippers, fishes, snakes ... although we didn't get to see the elusive crocodiles or sea otters. The paths/tracks have been made easier to walk and shelters provided within easy reach in case of inclement weather. The 3 of us enjoyed our hike and nature and we saw families with children also appreciated the trip & experience there."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Better to go during weekday. Area not crowded. Greay place to bring young children for education and appreciate nature. do wear long sleeave,pant and insect repellent as well as water ."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Quiet and lovely place for nature lovers.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful! Just beautiful! One of the best experiences of my entire life ❤
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"First time coming here with my family for hiking. Good place for a nature walk. Tried to catch some glimpse of crocodile but too bad don’t have. However, we manage to see monitor lizards and squirrels.

Note: please prepare mosquito patch, insect repellent and sunblock in advance."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Tip go early. By 8am the carpark is almost full save for one or two remaining lots.

Honestly, the last time I have been here must have been at least 10 years ago. Looks like the reserve has gotten larger. The park is adding a new bridge that will be commissioning soon.

We came to see the crocs. Boy did we see them. Spotted 3! One probably swam across the Straits 😂! Monitor lizards aplenty, big and small, all love to bask in the sun. At the centre, look up and you can see a family of bats zzzing away. Lots of fish in the waters too. It was high tide when we went so we could see the waters going into the reserve. They looked like rapids with the inter tidal changes. Nice!

It was shady with the foliage cover but not much shade at the coastal trail. Well, it’s the closest to visiting Malaysia at this point! Watch for your telco provider on your phone saying Welcome to Malaysia! *cheap thrill eh?*

Trails were relatively flat, some had new broadwalk put in. So easy for strollers and wheelchairs so long as you stay on the path.
No bicycle riding in the reserve, do that outside. Park has alot of visitors on the weekend.

It was a nice walk. Glad we managed to see the birds, insects, reptiles that we wanted to see - all in their natural habitat!

Keep the wetland clear of rubbish to be enjoyed by generations to come. ✌🏻🐊

5 stars, just for the rich wildlife the park has (including humans 😬)."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Looking so cute lot of lovely places have

Be careful with crocodiles on the trail.
So impressive with spiral snail observation tower."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to get a peek at nature. Saw a crocodile, a king cobra (very lucky to have a park staff point that out to us in a crowd), loads of hulking monitor lizards and of course lots of birbs within a short 2 hours.

Bring mosquito repellent, it's a marsh."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place for a walk with the family
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place to explore, like out of Singapore and you get to see JB skyline from across the straits."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for walk n nature view😍😍😍
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to see nature and appreciate how close we are to Malaysia.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Easy and fun walk through nature, most of the way well shaded. Spot wildlife in the tidal zones.If you mind insect bites, repellents are a must.  Can get crowded during peak periods."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for a stroll!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Perfect for those who love to bond with nature..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"We had a great time here.
Granted, it was crowded, but not terribly.
But, what we enjoyed most was seeing a many wild animals not in cages, but right out in the open."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Decided to revisit this park after 7-8 yrs. Many changes to the park. Love the pods for wildlife viewing. Gallery displays well executed and pathways all in good conditions. Managed to see the egrets, migratory birds, monitor lizards and the lively mudskippers. Sadly there are a lot of rubbish washed up at the mangroves. It was high tide and the sea level covered the whole tree trunk!
Easy to go via bus : just take 925 at khatib or Woodlands."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice spot for a nature walk , looking at some crocodiles. Some hideouts are also pretty nice spot to watch wildlife. Will also make you realize how close you are from.the Malaysian border"

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Fruitful day. Migratory season. Storks of the day 😍😍
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Rare wilderness in Singapore. Witness some crocodiles. Up close with monitor lizards, mudskeepers etc."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Great place for a walk about. Saw some bats, mangrove birds, puffer fish, needle fish, mud skippers, crabs and the star of the show is the croc. i spotted quite a big one on the main bridge."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Peaceful place for walk love the nature,was lucky saw 2 time crocodile"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"There are two key areas to walk around - coastal trail and the bird-watching circle around bird watching hideout 1A to 1E (rest of area is out of bounds). Park at carpark C to start off with the coastal trail of about 1.5km, or alternatively drive up directly to the inner carpark to just do the bird watching loop (though the inner carpark is always full to the brim). Takes about 2-2.5hrs to complete the whole thing.

The cool pods you see on social media can be found along the coastal trail (and also all the buildings across at JB is so close you almost could swim over).

The trails are pretty easy to walk though there are portions which are uneven pathways so be sure to watch your steps.

Most wildlife animals are found along the bird watching loop though, which is where the real wetlands are. We saw saltwater crocodile, lime green snake, squirrels, majestic horn bill birds, many shorebirds and monitor lizards. There’s also more we could not find but if you are lucky maybe you will bump into them like pytons or even the legendary king cobra (as told to me by a seasoned photographer there). Best signs of sightings are when you see professional Photogs hovering around, usually it’s because they see something and waiting to capture. Strike up a conversation and you’ll be surprised to learn many things!

There’s a lot of huts to watch the shorebirds at, and be sure to bring a pair of binoculars though, because they can be quite far.

Toilets and water points can only be found at the starting point of the coastal trail and also at the wetlands. There are some pictorial gallerys to share more about what you can encounter.

Opens 7am to 7pm, sep to March is the season to catch migratory birds making a pit stop here, and they are most active when it’s low tide so they can fish for food."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very interesting wetlands nature area. Somewhat out of the way but worth the trip.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Migratory birds, mangrove forest , coastal walk are extraordinarily curated nature park."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great park to do a short walk around and to do some bird watching! Might even spot crocodiles in the water :)
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Spore's very own rainforest. Good place to getaway from busy city life. Best to come in a weekday

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A very serene park, many species of birds, fishes, trees and plants (mosquito repellant a must)"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice, quiet trail. Shaded. Close to nature. Few mangrove area to see"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Good for a 1-2 hour trip. Flat walks on well managed paths. Everything is pretty accessible for wheelchairs and push chairs. There are a couple of vending machines and a water fountain, but no food stall/cafe selling food. Can be tricky getting a cab to pick you up from here."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A good place to get close to the nature.. but watch out for the lurking crocodile..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Will be really hot in the day, bring bott drink, food, hat, Bino, shades, camera, fan... N bring your rubbish out too"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place to see nature, see crocodile in the wild. Definitively a good place to bring kids to introduced them to nature while doing a bit of hiking. Just be aware and follow the signs. There are clean bathrooms and drinking fountains  to soothe the thirst.
I saw a crocodile in this area also so place follow the signs."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Easy trail and be careful with wild animals
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Went to the park around 4pm, it was such a peaceful, relaxing and beautiful nature reserved.

Managed to spot the iconic crocodile next to the wooden bridge.

Was super lucky upon exiting the park exit, cause an oriental hornbill landed on a tree across the road mere meters away from me. It stayed in the tree for a good few minutes before it took off.

Love the nature reserved, highly recommended for everyone."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Got time to briskwalk with my brother.  Always a refreshing change.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wait to watch the famous tailless crocodile emerge from the waters. Its humongous. Worth the visit.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Cool place pretty  amazing  idea to build  a staircase  on the water.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Rediscover Singapore and visit Sungei Buloh! Even better if you join a guide nature tour, you'll see so much more. A great experience for both the young and old.

For those who insist that Singapore is ultra urban and devoid of nature, you'll be amazed with the variety of wildlife here. Look out for the colony of bats nesting at the roof of the main entrance area."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"If you wanna go close to nature, this is nature at its best in SG. We were to lucky to spot a lazy monitor lizard & 2 aligators! There were also crabs & lotsa mudskippers... love this place!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nature environment..spend quality time with family with fresh air 💕Shiok!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Great Place for the people's admiring nature and greens... If you are lucky, you can see a reptile or two... Else you only see reptiles in the warning signs... Not suitable for walk, jog, skate boarding, cycling etc... Because this place kinda looks deserted... And finally do not forget to bring the mosquito repellent lotion..."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lovely Wetlands, managed to see nature up close"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Naturey and good experience
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Beautiful walk around the nature reserve, lots of wildlife to spot - crocs and a king cobra if you are lucky!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good place to walk around..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A place to relax with nature, sunlight and wild."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Simply one of the best places in singapore for just casual walking while admiring the scenic beauty of nature and a vast variety of animals. Would recommend 10/10, the thrill of finding these wild animals beats the Zoo for sure. Heres some photos i took at sungei buloh"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"So beautiful.. come at highest tide or slightly after... trees half submerged on a sunny but cloudy day brings amazing light through the canopy.. and on your return loop.. you can see the difference as the tide recedes..  plenty of water.. no shops.. but there are vending machines.. drinks n snacks.. so coins are GOLD!
Did the Coastal Trail.. pretty much the outer perimeter of the park n reserve.. took our time and stopped at every instance they could be wildlife or cool insects..  covered almost 7km in a bout 2+ hours.."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice place for a walk. If you're lucky you'll be able to spot crocodiles, monitor lizards,squirrels, eagles, etc. There are 2 nice visitor centres with clean toilets at the 2 carparks. Terrain is also easy friendly enough for kids."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It is a good place to go
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Visited here twice, once in the late afternoon (low tide) & once in the early afternoon (high tide). Abundance of wildlife."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Really cool little park, where you can follow the trail along the coast and see across to Malaysia. There are crocodiles here, although can be hard to spot so give yourself some time to wait as it is worth it! Plenty of facilities at the park entrance, including lockers and bathrooms. It is hard to get taxis to pick up from this location so be aware. There are buses that service though."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Beautiful nature scenery away from urban city lifestyle.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"I went here last week to enjoy wildlife.
Just 1 hour from the center of the city, You can find many kind if birds, reptiles, etc here.
To go there, I use Kranji MRT station and Grab.
Ba careful that sometimes it takes time to catch Grab or taxi at the site."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Such a stunning natural beauty in this place! Saw many komodo dragons.. the mangroves were so vast, with so many vantage points to see over vast expanses of mud flats and natural flora and fauna"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A great place to explore nature.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice nature reserve where you get the chance to observe wild life. Of course as this is a nature reserve and NOT a zoo, it depends on the season of migration and your luck to see many different types of wild life or just see nothing :) .
It also has some magnificent view for the sunset and free parking all day from 7AM to 7PM.
It has restrooms, cold water dispenser and wheelchair accessible parking."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Cool. After the rain. Get to see lots of herons hunting for food. Crocs quite common too, mostly under water waiting for prey"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Interesting walk...
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Be one with nature here. Nice trails and kid friendly.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Lovely place.. however, birds were seen less when visited, though this place has so many varieties.. need to go back for more.. will have a detailed review after more visits.."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Amazing, good experience, more thrilling, greenish"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to take your kids, especially when you don't want to pay SGD33 to visit the zoo. The 3 km nature trail is moderately easy and good exercise for both kids and elderly. If you have difficulty spotting animals just ask any of the numerous photography enthusiast there and they will happily point you in the direction of the nearest animal."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to workout and enjoy the nature.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice variety of wildlife and yet very accessible
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Not bad
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A place to explore n adventurous
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place enjoy forest life
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"It's a nice place with quite a few scenic spots. Suitable for family and friends for a good walk around the reserve. It will be better to go during low tide so if u are lucky, u may even spot a crocodile! Other than this, there are many spots for birds lovers where they can observe in a hide. Carpark space for cars and motorcycles parking are available. Hope everybody had a good walk!!! *Cheers!!!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It was still drizzling when we started our walk for about 2hrs, generally flat ground and lots of lizards and snakes spotted on the day (warn by the staff at visitor centre)

Suitable to bring your kids and old folks for a casual walk. The scenery are really awesome and good for taking a break from the four walls at work.

Look up and you will find hidden treasure among the trees during your walk [;"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Not as crowded on a Saturday afternoon... A very relax reserve n beautiful POTs of like a fish baskets ""display"" on the mangroves trail which u could see Johore on the opposite side of the sea... Awesome..."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to explore the wildlife
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to take a walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Managed to see a crocodile/ alligator in the river. This place brings back tons of childhood memories and since we are unable to travel to JB due to lock down, it serves as a good spot to look over at JB and imagine those times when you could actually go there"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Closest to the raw nature. Spot crocodile, hornbill, other birds, monitor lizard, crab, mud fish, all are there, waiting for you.. it's not very long hike, so very kid friendly, just make sure to watch them, otherwise crocodile might be hungry 😀"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Excellent place for a walk and to see some wildlife up close. Please don’t litter if you go here, too many people have and it spoils what is otherwise a fantastic place showing how biodiversity and cities can exist closely."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lovely place!
If you don't have a car, be aware that it's really hard to get a Grab / Gojek to pick you up there."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Arrived on a Saturday morning and was surprised to see so many people visiting the place. Learnt that there is a tour bus service from Kranji which explains the traffic. The main carpark was pretty full but we were fortunate to be able to get a lot without waiting for long. The trails are pretty easy and family/elderly friendly as most are either on proper wooden paths or well set out dirt tracks. We felt like novice hikers as most people came in fully decked out long sleeves and long pants with hats, either to avoid mosquitos or perhaps the sun. We took upon ourselves to walk about 2 of the main tracks, one to spot wildlife, mainly birds, monitor lizards, and the occasional crocodile and the other to check out the pretty instagrammable huts. We pushed ourselves to check out one more trail by driving to the other carpark, but could not find the motivation to leave the car, hence concluding our day hike experience.

All in all, the place was just how I remembered when visiting as a primary school kid on excursion. Mostly good memories.

For foodies, there isn’t much to eat in the area but a regret was not to check out Bollywood veggie which seems quite raved."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of our favourite nature place to visit in Singapore. Able to see migratory birds and the resident crocodiles. Always enjoy the short trails.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A slight getaway towards the countryside of Singapore. 🤫 10/10 worth a hidden gem .
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"We had a lovely walk in Sungei Buloh wetland reserve. Even managed to spot a hornbill while walking the trail. Loved the serenity, bird calls and cools Breeze almost the trees. if you need an escape from our concrete jungle head to Sungei Buloh for an escape into nature. Go before 7pm as it closes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,good to walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Happy Sunday
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A good outing with friends and family, very educational and great wildlife/outdoor exposure for everyone. During our walkabout, we manage to spot a lot of different types of birds, insects, and animals. (E.g. red ant nest, bird nest, small snakes, monitor lizard, snakehead fish, bats, birds, etc).

Entrance is free, there are also cold water dispenser, and clean toilet. Public bus to this area is very frequent. Overall great experience and highly recommend!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place for kids to learn about mangrove environment and can see some animals upclose. The highlight is the mud walk.try to come before the high tide where the muddy area will be cover by sea water. Wear insect patch or repellent. Since it's a nature reserve just keep be abit alert at all times coz there are some monkey or even snake sightings if h r lucky
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It's rare to see so many monitor lizards crossing the pathways and birds flying on the flatlands. Also spotted a the crocodile chilling under the mangrove trees! Felt like I was away from Singapore for a bit!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"If you love nature, you'll love it here. 😊 I also like that they added a touch of beautiful structure there.. makes the place instragramble in every angle.  And it is a unique place. A lot of different kinds of migratory birds you can observe from a far."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Mangrove nature park with bird 🦢 🦅 observatory points. Coastal boardwalk view facing nearby Johor Bahru. Spiders 🕷 web, can’t see any crocodile 🐊 although there’s warning signboards. Bird lover’s photographers ideal destination for photo shooting."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Best place to get away from the buzz of the city. Closest to Nature. Too close that we got chased by monkeys when we stopped to have some snacks. Our mistake! I appreciate our officers to keep this place as natural as it could be. I also do not appreciate some unethical humans who dirty the place with their plastic trash!!!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place for bird photographer s and bird watchers. Very nice and relaxing place. Free car park. Well arranged hiding point to shoot and watch birds. 2 hours walking distance from start to end. The season for migration birds are September to March. Place is nice to visit with family and childeren. Public transport is available. Mobile will go roaming when you are there.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Intresting place to go i get to see crocodile.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great weekend visit to see the intersection of urban and wetlands in Singapore. Do plan the trip of low tide times like early morning 8.00 am  to catch the birds, monitor lizards, crocodiles. The facility is nicely maintained good spend half a day here. Great place for nature lovers!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,You feel so good and feel relaxing...
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"definitely a very good place to just take a walk and enjoy the nature here, both fauna and flora - and to get away from the concrete jungle that is Singapore. facilities available here are surprisingly good too, and well maintained."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice wk end spot.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A nice mangrove sanctuary in the corner of Singapore and in the border of Johor. Singapore's government really concerns with the environment and present it as a way of relaxation and education.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,EH LANJIAO THIS PLACE GOT MONITOR LIZARD ONE DONT PLAY PLAY IF UR A CHILD U BETTER BE CAREFUL THESE REPTILIANS ARE HUGE
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Barks better than it’s bite.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Definitely a nice place to take family too but have to make sure that you are going early in the morning.  Bring lots of mosquito repellent spray/patches/band as it is infested with them.  And water too because it does get hot by around 10am
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of the best parks in Singapore. I don't think you can spot wild crocodiles anywhere else. It's also pretty popular for bird watching.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,serene & nice nature 🤩
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"This is a best place for those who like to see native inhabitants which include kingfisher and sunbirds. Other that that, you still can encounter Malayan water monitor lizards and crocodile."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"MUST VISIT !
This is a different Singapore. With REAL wild life ! You can see insects spiders plants animals birds that you will not find in other parts of Singapore. Walk carefully because the monitor lizard or even a crocodile may cross the footpath! Look up into the trees n leaves u could see a large spider !
Watch the eagle dive into the sea to catch a fish for breakfast !
And if wait long enough.. the crocodile may catch the monitor lizard for food !
A totally different experience of Singapore !"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Singapore maybe a city within a garden, but it is the few wetlands that throughly brings out the natural beauty of natural habitat. At Sungei Buloh one can see not only the birds, flowers and insects, but the monitor lizards and crocodiles 🐊 as well. Open from 7am to 7 pm, it’s a nature photographer’s paradise. There’s a little cafe that serves local cuisine and an air conditioned visitor centre museum within the compound. The hike along the 3 km paths are easy for a family day fun walk. It’s a place to come and get away from the crowded city."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"If you are into nature walks and bird watching, this is one destination you can consider! An easy trail with plenty of rest stops and while on the various trails, you might occasionally spot a few wild animals too! Best to drive to this place though there are also shuttle buses provided that depart from Kranji MRT station."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Always a delightful place for bird watching. The crocodiles and monitor lizards add flavour to the place.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It is a good place for trekking.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"The waterfront views are great. Monitor lizards chilling in the sun on the trail was just amazing too. Few of the spots were a let down due to the parade of loud selfie seekers. Remember to pack your snacks and water bottle. No picnics allowed, but the whole trip back and forth in the sun will get exhausting without some nourishment."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Good place for day out with family. Trekking wise distance too short and routes are nicely done.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very nice place for a walk with family.. Everything is good except two things msquitoes and road condition.  Long pants with mosquito patch or spray is must for kids. Wild mosquitoes are really aggressive..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is likely Singapore's most eco-friendly park, the biodiversity bloom is so evident, and it's such a pleasure to trek through the wetlands and enjoy nature. And NPark has done an excellent job of curating an immersive experience for visitors"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place for trekking.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Beautiful, breezy nature reserve envionment. Educational and just right for hiking for the seniors."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Was a nice place. Had to wear the mask throughout even though it was very hot and uncomfortable. Should go on a cool day
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"By far my favorite reserve in Singapore!
Free parking, even path ways, well sheltered, no annoying cyclists!

Crocodiles were a little difficult to spot otherwise 6 stars!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,This is a great place to get away from the sounds of cars on the street and relax.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A very peaceful place to be at with very less crowd on Saturday mornings!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice wetlands with well maintained walking paths. Very immersive experience. You will get to see many wildlife including lots of birds. Well worth the visit, even worth going back again."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Rich of educational! Got chance to see the real wild crocodile! Not many people even in Weekend (may be due to the not so convenient - no any restaurant in the customer center), and totally FREE!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"So beautiful! Finally some real nature in Singapore. Lots of mossies though but also a huge amount of fish and even crocodiles! Not to mention the birdlife here. You can even see Malaysia on the other side of the water. I recommend spending at least 2h here and not too late in the day. Best time, I guess, is very early or before sunset when the wildlife is active the most."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice view.
Fresh air
Suitable for jogging"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A nature fun environment with migrant birds. One could easily spend at least 2 to 3 hours enjoying the natural surrounding especially during low tide. I saw 3 crocodiles, (one of which has a missing tail piece) resting on the wetland."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is a fairly big wetland and it will take some time to cover the whole area. Choose what you like to see and explore the area at your own pace. The Mangrove Boardwalk is an interesting track to try and it is a nice way to learn more about the mangrove ecosystem. The Buloh Tidal Ponds is a long track but it is reasonably shady and offers many opportunities to see some interesting creatures, like crocodile during low tide, mudskipper, spiders and  monitor lizard."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Awesome place away from the city!!! We went in the evening in July. Mosquitoes did not bother us at all. We saw bats, crocodiles (usually by the bridge to the loop trail), and of course, mud skippers. We did not see any water monitors (huge lizards). They must not be out in evening?"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place for migratory bird watching and monitor lizard experience
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A place where you can view squirrels, spider, crocodile, birds, mangroves, go early at 7am to start your walk with watching sunrise. Watch crocodile sunbathing and beautiful mangrove at low tides."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Excellent piece of nature! A lot to see and a lot of education along the tracks, well done Singapore. Vending machines unfortunately don't accept cards so bring some 2 dollar notes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,1,Gem of the North-West. Great for Wine Picnic!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Visit between Oct and Jan as this is the birds migratory season
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Finally, I came there. This place is an deep dream that I want to visit, so I am very grateful to be able to set foot there.

Free of charge to sight seeing and walking around, please you can more explore about bird watching.

One of building, on the information area, they made the design interior very nice, informative and make you know a lot about wetlands including ecosistem.

If you are explorer and need more product knowlegde, high recommended to visit!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A wonderful place for nature lovers. One thing though, the monkeys there are super offensive. When I saw one on the rope bridge I was scared and it chased me! I didn't even bring any food! Overall good experience. 😁"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very nice spot for a time with nature full of relaxing spots
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A precious gem in the urban city!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very natural, can see different wild animals n tree snakes n big fishes over 3 feets in the water. We saw about 4 feet crocodile sunbathing at the bank. But must wear comfortable shoe."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,great place... quite sat afternoon.... I have a fun time with my girls and Nick.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A must go place for family especially children.  First class view of mangrove swamp.  Nice country side.
Trails are well paved.  Good for walking."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Quite lovely place for walk with friends or family. Try going there in the morning because the time it takes to circle around the area is between 1 to 2 hours
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Just like any other place in Singapore. Only think is that the signal from Malaysia takes over Singapore telecom signals.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Look like we're on the kampong side..very entersting
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A wonderful place for nature observers and bird watchers. If you're lucky you'd get to see some crocodiles lazing around as well. Beware of mosquitoes though!!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,I didn't get to see the great salty so was a bit disappointed. Yet maybe my timing was off so better attempt next visit.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Good & big natural Park for leisure walk. Ample parking. Water Point available. Lots of birds, fishes...etc to see. If you are lucky, may find  croc sunbathing."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It truly lives up to its name and it made me wet. Seeing 2 crocodiles in the wild in this city country tingled my loins.

Their names are Ernie and Bert. You can tell them apart from their accents- Ernie is more posh.

The monitor lizards were not as welcoming. A bird once took a poop in my ex's mouth so I'm always on good terms with them.

5/5 would go again."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Seen some crocodiles near the main entrance of the reserve and various Komodo dragons - was hoping to see a few eagles at Eagle Point. There are currently renovations and constructions going around so it wasn't an ideal time to visit.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Far far far way from town area... But nice place to have a short getaway 😍 #sawtwocrododiles 😂
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,This place has a rawness beauty. Good for a walk around to do bird watching
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Great scenic views and the chance to spot abundant wildlife makes this an excellent choice to visit. Trails aren't exceedingly difficult, most are well-paced with enough leg room for a small group of people to walk together. I have spotted storks, huge pelicans, all types of herons, monitor lizards in the pond, monitor lizards on the trails, a shocking amount of spiders, huge mudskippers that are surprisingly adorable to watch, and numerous other encounters etc. Recommended for a respite away from the urban landscape, the only drawback being the hard to reach location. Going by public transport requires one to change several buses and walk for a short while, not that hard by any means but more arduous than normal. I enjoy photography on the weekends there and it remains one of my favourite outdoor spots in Singapore. *photos have been edited"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Enjoyed the nature walk, was quite lucky to chance upon many wildlife animals (Egret, Herons mainly and the highlight of the walk - wildlife crocodile!!). My boy loved it! The walkway is not even, so gotta watchout when walking, some parts of the park is not so stroller-friendly."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is an experience I would highly recommend. There is a visitor centre here and you will get to learn about the wildlife present at the wetland. You will also learn about the migratory routes of the birds. From here, you have options for various trails. From the visitor centre, if you cross the bridge, you will enter the wetlands, where you may chance upon birds. On the other hand, you can go in the opposite direction towards the car park. From here, you can start the coast to coast trail, where you will end at Mangrove Gallery. Along the 1.3km coastal trail, there are numerous instagrammable spots, especially with the pods that are nicely shaped, and also provide shade from the sun.

Along the coast, you can also see Johor Bahru across the sea. There are signs warning of crocodiles, but none were seen on the day I was there.

I would highly recommend coming here. It will take about 1.5 hours if you slowly explore the trail and all that it has to offer. If you are using the Kranji Countryside Express bus to get here, the end point at the Mangrove Gallery also has another bus stop for you to be picked up once you're done with your coastal trail."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A really nice place for a walk if you love nature and scenic beauty. The route can be a
Iittle rough in some parts but should be ok for most people with a good pair of shoes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Haven't been to Sungei Buloh for almost 20 years.  There are so many improvements and much to see. Worth the trip.  Free entrance. And after exploring this reserve, there are many nearby farms to explore too. Can spend the whole day in this part of Singapore.  Thoroughly enjoyed the outing."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Amazing walk in the mangroves and lots of wildlife to see!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Amazing nature reserve with beautiful views of the Causeway and Malaysia. Different look out posts, distance of the trails also doable with younger kids."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Good place for nature and bird warching. Jungle, ponds, mangrove and shore/river. Salt water crocodiles, lots of birds, bats and other interesting nature."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Good Natural Reserve made from the River and swamp, and many varieties of birds, reptiles and fishes, insects, green snakes.
However sign posting still a little confusing, take 1 hour to get around several times before found carpark to get home"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Well maintained and family friendly. Heaps of migratory birds and wildlife to view from the numerous lookouts. Watch out for three crocodiles. Stay away from the edge of the water.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (SBWR) is in the north west coast of Singapore. A preserved marshland, full of both land creatures and birds.
At the visitor and entrance to the park, there are small bat's hanging from the roof. And each year, more than 3000 migratory birds pass through and make a stop at this area.
Each visit is a chance to see something different."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Wonderful mangrove forest tucked into the fast paced city life of Singapore. Watch out for monitor lizards, semi poisonous plants, migratory birds and if you're lucky you might even spot a croc."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,An excellent place to spend the day.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great way to get close to Nature in Urban Singapore. Check out the gorgeous Pods along the Coastal Trail too.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very far from the CBD area, but not too difficult to get to by public transport. A great place to spend a day. Lots to see, especially when the tide comes in and flood the whole mashes. Remember to bring food as there are no restaurants near by."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"If you enjoy bird watching, this is the best nature park in Singapore. Always enjoyed my visit there enjoying the fresh air and spending the morning with the birds. 😃"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place for explore & for trekking along the PCN tracks. Nice scenery by the lake.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A good place for hanging with friends and family.. Only transportation wise, need to be improved"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice place. One part of this place is for visitors to enjoy creativity, nature, park kind of. But  other side is mainly for bird watching and designed with sitting arrangements for bird watching without disturbing birds."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Love this place a lot.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,In touch with nature... Just be wary of what lurks from the waters..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"It's a good place for a hike, with quite a lot of shade and wildlife to see."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is my first visit to this place. I never think that Singapore still has a very beautiful mangrove forest. If you are a nature lover, you are bound to come to this place because this place is really fresh and if you are lucky, you will find wild animals such as squirrels, beavers, lizards, crabs, fishes, crocodiles and more.
The ideal time to visit is morning and when the tide is low. Do not forget to bring binoculars, cameras if you come here. For those who are allergic to mosquito bites you are required to carry anti-mosquito lotion. Overall, it takes 2 to 3 hours to explore. Do not worry, this place has a flat road and this place is safe to visit.
To get to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve by bus, board SMRT Bus 925 from Kranji MRT Station. Alight at Kranji Reservoir Carpark B to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Extension’s Visitor Centre."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Dress light, amazing outdoor adventure"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve is one of the fascinating nature walk in Singapore.

An escape from the concrete jungle, you can indulge in greenery and scenery. Take your time off and come with your cameras.

Do prepare a bottle of water and some repellent. And if you are lucky, you may see crocodiles lurking near the banks (not the savings bank if you know what I mean)

Area still under construction to improve our experience but the whole place is the best we can get to nature on mainland singapore.

Totally thrilled about walking around this reserve and loving it as it does takes your mind off the hectic urban lifestyle.

Furthermore it's free..but having your own transport would be a big bonus. Nonetheless there are shuttle buses catered so, not an excuse not to go and visit =)

Rmb, water bottle, repellent, umbrella(in case it rains) and wear covered shoes for ease of walking"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Lovely place to visit and it's far end but fun loving for nature lovers. pet is not allowed..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place to engage with nature and very educational. If possible, avoid Sunday. Best is to bring the binoculars to watch birds. This reserve is nicely done."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Where else to catch the migratory birds? Absolutely the best place for the birds and wildlife on the island. Kudos efforts from NParks to upkeep and consistently improving on the place... And it's free entry for the visitors.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to relax and get close to nature. Not many birds but saw a 8-ft long crocodile on the path about 20 ft from me.  The croc ran back to the water.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are a lot of folks who got there to take photos of the birds and other wildlife.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Perhaps I went there too early, still low tide and not many birds around. 😅
One thing bothering me was the human noise.. Including the renovation machines and the Quran reciting from opposite country..."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,The place has changed from the many years that I have visited. It has become more touristy. Good place to go for a walk in the nature. Some interesting 'attractions' which will make the walk worth going.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Big area if ur interested to walk around the reservoir
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A super nice place to relax with a group of good friends.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"So many lovely tracks, birds and wildlife. Insect repellent definitely required."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,I love this place as it is surrounded by the beauties of nature. The animals there are wonderful and I really enjoyed the trip as I could also see Malaysia from a distance. I recommend anyone to go there.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice experience
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve - very beautiful, nature reserve in Singapore. I really love the design of the shelter very much. It looks like a bird nest, so unique and interesting.

Get to see alot of insects and animals. I'm actually afraid of insects but it was an interesting trip and I got to know alot more about the animals and insects.

Saw a couple of centipedes, caterpillars and crocodiles. There was also a crocodile name tailless cos she doesn't have a tail after a fight lol. Just take note that you will need to bring along your insect repellent and patches cos the mosquitoes at Sungei Buloh are all commandos."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Feel like country side away from city life.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Well protected nature place thriving with different kind of wild life species. Fruitful trip with sightings of the komodo dragons, mud crabs & a lucky encounter with the estuarine crocodiles!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Well maintained flora and fauna. Also quite breezy with a lot of animals. Just too much mosquitoes and termites.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Things has changed so much since my last visit 15yrs back.

Board bus service 925 from Kranji mrt to the carpark just outside Sungei buloh. Its a short 10mins walk to the visitor centre.

There is No entrance fee!

Place is well maintained with toilets, rest points, paved path etc. Definitely should come for a visit to check out the nature in our concrete jungle. Ideal for nature lovers, couples, kids to spend a good half day.

There are crocs and we spotted 2 during our trek but they couldnt be bothered with us. Check out the photos!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Walkways have been improved and one must spend time there to really appreciate the nature and the wildlife!

A lot of bird watchers with telescopic camera lens patiently waiting to take the perfect shots of some very rare migration birds; otherwise there is really not much to see or excitement for majority of people visiting this place.

No benches for people to rest while walking the vast lands inside and should have at least a coffee vending machine or a cafe near the reception area for people to chill down or have a cup of good coffee!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great for family time. Lots of wildlife sightings like crocodiles, eagles, etc."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Lovely
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Nice broad walk area with good photo spot here and there. Few locations need to climb stairs but the steps are not tall, so if take your time slowly go up or now still ok. Walking route are well paved, so not tough to walk (doesn't really require any trekking shoes etc - still, having a good pair of non-slip walking shoes is advisable)."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This 200-acre reserve, situated north of the island, is home to over 150 species of rare and exotic birds."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Nice trail. Nothing much to see though. At least today.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place to visit  but go early as there are very limited parking lots. Morning sun is good also.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice short getaway.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,So nice to go to a place to see endangered bird species live without the fear of being poached as it is in surrounding countries.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Enjoyed the walking very much, it is a well preserved place with lots of trees to shelter from the sun. Was looking forward to see crocodiles but didn't managed to. Great place for walks and hikes!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A great place for a stroll with the family and bonding..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Nice place to take pictures
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Love it..Plan yo going back there again❤❤❤❤
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice nature walk right here in Singapore

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice cool weather and natural surround. Healthy walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's wonderful coming down here everyone once in while, you escape the hustle and bustle of the city and come close to nature. Wonderful experience"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Relaxing place, plenty of nature to observe (look hard for the Mudskippers).

Expect to spend 3-4 hours there!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"In urban Singapore, Sungei Buloh is a refreshing escape. Lush, green, studded with mangroves, its a haven for birds & birdwatchers. Even for those not in to birdwatching, this is a perfect place to enjoy nature."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Land of Crocodile Spotting
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Always love to walk and do nature  photography here , lot of animals and birds here, bring lot of water and change of clothes in case it rained or after walking u be sweating all over, u can take bus 925M from kranji mrt"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Very special park with amazing wildlife experience. But the large amounts of trash along the shore is a shame..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"The best nature reserve in singapore, I would say. You can observe mangroves and the curious shape of mangrove roots from close proximity, various birds and fish, squirrel and crocodile if you're lucky. The wooden pods are also very photogenic."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to unwind on weekend!!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,good place to spend a day
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lots of migratory birds in this area.
Less crowded even during weekends

Crocs are spotted in this area"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,See how they do ecological restoration and enjoy the nature feeling here. Can see a lot of wetland creatures.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Can see jb from here!!!beware of crocodile
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"I can find out a lot of wild animals. It is quite pram-friendly and easy to walk. Great spot to chill with the small kids. A bit hard to access as compared with other popular spots, but  If you have a car, it is a place you must visit."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,I just love this place! A lot of wildlife to view and appreciate!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to look at mudflats. If you are lucky enough, catch a glimpse of crocodiles and the resident monitor lizards."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful place. Good for a half-day getaway from the city
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful nature park. We managed to see quite a bit of animals here too. This place is very peaceful with little people. Great escape from the hustle.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Good place fir walking to observe nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Came here 3 times... This time saw lots of cros 4 or 5
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"there is just so much wildlife here in Sungei Buloh it's hard to believe it exists in the bustling city of Singapore. It has estuarian crocodiles, large tree snakes, common malayan water monitor lizards, common sandpiper, Chinese egret, hornbills and waterhens and much much more. Vending machines are weird. 3 machines right next to each other selling the same drink for $1.30, $1.20 and $1.00 respectively. You can even buy toys and water filters for literally $99??! Toys? In a wildlife reserve? Strange. Still, highly recommend this place to all who love nature and everything animals. Also, see horseshoe crabs, the oldest crabs ever!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Despite being a stone city, we do care for nature! We experience what nature has to offer Sunday morning walk at the 202 ha of this rare oasis of natural wonders and home to unique plants and animals. Following through the trails of mangroves, mudflats, ponds and forest with refreshing smell, sights and sounds of nature. Started from the visitor centre at Kranji way, we head to theForest Trail, a 300metre stroll to the mid of Canopy Walk and to the Eagle Point lookout pod. There are five look out pods that could give you different views. After completing the Coastal Trail, we continued to the Magrove Boardwalk and the Migrating Bird Trail. It was certainly a refreshing and educational morning for me. Would love to do it again."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good walk around to experience nature.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Great place to see nature at it's best. View is nice and the walk along the coastal line is refreshing, especially when there's a sea breeze."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Awesome
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wonderful nature park. Feel relax and enjoyed. Thank you nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Litter was a sad sight. Some parts smells when tide is low.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Loved it! Crocodiles, huge monitor lizards, turtles, bats, otters, birds all present. Very cool place."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A place that worth visiting. With surprises of seeing wild animals.

Spot the wild crocodile! In the photo."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Perhaps I came at the wrong time of the day or at the wrong season of the year, but it's not quite as teeming with life as I hoped it'd be due to all the ponds drying up and all. Will come again during a wetter season."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Very nice place, well organized and even better labeled.
The only problem - it is overcrowded.
I went there early morning on a work day, during Covid (no tourists, just residents).
Too many people, you cannot connect with this beautiful nature."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A great gem of Singapore nature reserve , keep it up."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Love the sighting of birds and insects. It’s really hot and far from public transportation.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It's a pure nature! We saw a lot of wild animals and we heard that the saltwater crocodiles live there!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a nature reserve in the northwest area of Singapore. It is the first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore (2002), and its global importance as a stop-over point for migratory birds was recognised by the inclusion of the reserve into the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network. The reserve, with an area of 130 hectares, was listed as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003. It is a nature park and wetland area reserve known for migratory birds with a visitor center.
Previously unheard of as a nature area, the site gained prominence only in 1986 when a call was made to conserve the area by members of the Singapore Branch of the Malayan Nature Society. Particularly significant was its unusually high variety of bird species, which included migratory birds from as far as Siberia on their way to Australia to escape the winter months. Their suggestion was taken up by the government, and a site with an area of 0.87 km² was given nature park status in 1989. The Parks & Recreation Department, a precursor to today's National Parks Board, developed and managed the nature park with a team of experts. The most notable names from the team included the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust from the United Kingdom and World Wide Fund for Nature. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, then known as Sungei Buloh Nature Park, was officially opened on 6 December 1993 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Over the years, Sungei Buloh charmed people to support its cause. It welcomed its 100,000th visitor in 1994. In 1997, the Park found its corporate sponsor in HSBC, which set up the Sungei Buloh Education Fund in support of its nature outreach programmes. In 1999, Woodlands Secondary School at Marsiling Road became the first school to adopt the park. It was followed by Commonwealth Secondary School at West Coast Road in 2001 and Hillgrove Secondary School at Bukit Batok Street 52 in 2002. The latter two are still actively involved in the programme. The government formally announced on 10 November 2001 that the park would be accorded nature reserve status, a step that protects the area from any unauthorised destruction or alteration. The second phase of the park was opened, and the entire site of 130 hectares officially gazetted on 1 January 2002 as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. It is one of the four nature reserves to be gazetted. The others are Labrador Nature Reserve, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve.
It is located at Neo Tiew Crescent which is 15 minutes from Kranji MRT Station. Buses serving there are Kranji Express and SMRT Buses Service 925C that operates only on Sundays and Public Holidays."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A good place to unwind, fresh air, walking exercise and see eagles at eagle peak."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"We took over one hour 30 mins to get there. But I don’t think it’s worthy it. The reserve have many lizards and birds, except that nothing. We run into raining and wait on the tower for one hour."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Perfect place to unwind and spend the weekend with family and friends. Good to learn about the ecosystem that supports the last few remaining wetlands in Singapore.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Remote but well kept nature reserve. We encountered a few animals ( monitor lizard, snake, mudskippers, tons of birds, etc) but didn't get lucky enough to spot a crocodile. Trail is quite short but you can spend lots of time enjoying the serenity and animal watching). Even bathroom facilities were very clean"

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Rich with wildlife and suitable for people of all fitness levels.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,1,Few animal sightings. Disappointing. Travelled so far for nothing.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to see wildlife in a safe environment
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Perfect day out!! It’s best to go early as you can get a beautiful sunrise and view to Malaysia. Morning is more cooling as walkways are mostly near the seaside. Well arranged, much to see and experience."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Interesting walk, the first part (west side) was not too interesting for us since we didn't come to look at the few birds around and that rehabilitation work was going on, making the view not as nice as it could be. East side was better and the wooden constructions overlooking the water between Singapore and Malaysia is a good view. Only way out was bus since we were too far away from the city to get a cab."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great nature trail to see bird and crocs
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Well maintained natural heaven😂
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Great place to bond with the mother nature

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Favourite wetland in Singapore
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice Buffy Fish-owl
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A god tier nature attraction in Singapore, very well reserved and beautiful, it lets you get close and fully immerse into wetland environment. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon and the park was very empty and quiet (except some construction works inside), even though the area isn't that big, I still managed to walk 3.5 hours going through every trail and enjoy myself in the breathtaking nature (15:30-19:00). I was the last visitor out at 7pm. Afterwards you can walk along the bridge behind to capture the stunning Malaysia border coastline and sunset by the Kranji reservoir beach, you can even hear the loudspeakers from the mosque on the other side. It's a sight you will never forget .

About the safety, the crocodiles won't attack you if you see them, and they're the small size ones so not even close to threatening. But do be careful of a few wild dogs that live inside, the park ranger says they only bark at you and never attack, but those dogs are definitely not friendly and you would want to turn around if you see one. Also, use mosquito spray or patches.

Traffic Method: Take 925 bus at Kranji station bus stop Berth 2, get off at Kranji Reservoir Park, you'll see the entrance top right on the main road. Same when going back.

The last 925 bus back to Kranji is 8pm, so watch out for the time if you don't want to take Grab."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Have a relaxing time here, close to nature"

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Due to Covid 19,some of the routes are closed. We managed to walk through the board walk, enjoying the wet reserve sanctuary. The well preserved canopy provided an excellent walk, with the constant breeze n shelter from the sun. If u r a bird watcher enthusiast accompanied with the hobby of photography, this is one of the places to go to."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Unfortunately getting overcrowded and over developed which may disturb the natural habitat. Miss the natural walking path...
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"A little too man made for my taste, but its a beautiful place that captures nature in its own habitat. Sadly the place is dirty and needs to be cleaned up. Great place for a family walk."

I was immensely disappointed not to see a crocodile, but I've been assured that plenty exist. Lots of birds and water monitor lizards though.
And you can see JB within swimming distance! (though don't try it or you'll get nabbed by the ICA)

A cool day out for those wanting to escape city life."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A chance to get close to mangroves and marshes. The walk was splendid with various  educational signages. It is worth the visit despite of the high humidity.

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Get up close to nature. Take your time and enjoy a lazy morning
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,This is a big (by local standards) park and nature reserve. Not much wildlife (area probably too done up) except for the occasional monitor lizard and flying insects.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Worth visiting at least once if you have never been here before.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Better than Botanical Garden.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nvr see crocodile
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Last of its kind.

Sungei bulok really is, the last frontier of Singapore. The reserve is huge and teeming with wildlife as not much was touched by construction. Occasionally u could see a saltwater crocodile bank and lay RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRAIL and you would just fathom at the majestive creature. From birds to fishes and lizards to snakes, There's plenty of Singaporean wildlife roaming free around the reserve."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for a walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Hard to access but worth the trouble

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Really easy to see a lot of animals, crocodiles, varants, cool birds and more ! Quite nice to escape the city there, even if it's a but far form center, it helps to disconnect."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,1,"If you don't like the outdoors like me, my advice is: don't go."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Enjoyed the visit did some 12,600 steps in the jungle heat was exhausted!! Didnt see many animals no crocs thankfully maybe mid-day heat they stayed under cover. Did see hugh monitor lizards fighting or cuddling maybe! Would have liked to see a small cafe/gift shop for a drink and souvenir of my visit. Some more seating at the Wetland Centre a drinks machine but nowhere to rest?"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,I came to see crocodiles and didnt find any. But i saw many crabs chilling on all the mangroves and they were probably cuter anyway
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good place for refreshing after stressful weekday.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"You'll be able to meet Komodos in person, see crocodile hunting for birds who's hunting for fish at the river. What a life!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Great
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Saw a croc!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Not for the adventurous hikers, paths are already all carved out with nothing much to explore. Kid and elderly friendly hike trails."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Really Cool and Nice Area and I got to see many different birds and Insects. Would definitely recommend you to go as a family trip or alone just to relax and let loose. It will be nicer before sun rise , so maybe go around 6.30am."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,People who love Nature Flora and fauna sungei buloh is the best choice
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,2,👍
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Very enjoying walking to the mangrove Park while wild live run in it natural habitat, only that sigh board didn't shows the distance."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wonderful place for nature lovers
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,If u want to go deeper into the nature...
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Walking Relax wetland, nice outdoor place"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,Be careful to key in the destination as Google map lead me to somewhere not near to the visitor centre. Must keyin visitor centre then  correct.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It is a place where you have close encounter with creatures such as monitor lizards, giant spiders, squirrels, and even crocodiles etc! You may even spot migratory birds if you go at the right season. These animals roam freely within the reserve that comprise of forest, ponds, mangroves etc. Definitely nature and bird photographers' heaven! However do protect yourself from mosquito bites with insect repellent."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great bird watching place!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Huge biodiversity. But it's home to some uncommon birds like the Copper throated sunbird

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,We manage to catch a glimpse of the resident crocs
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It is surprisingly quiet (as long as u avoid human beings who come in grps n screaming at top of their voice) but full of life!! Keep a look out for the elusive crocodiles and otter family. The stray dogs will follow u for a distance but generally harmless... juz remember to bring ur trash along with u and dont litter. Rubbish bins are rare sight here in the footpaths but understandably so
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,2,"There's really so little development done to this place, even birds won't move in. I feel that more should be done to make this place vibrant with wildlife. Truly what is the point of a reserve if there's no life in it. I had more fun in Admiralty park than this place."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A great place to visit once in a while to unwind oneself from the hassle and bustle of city life.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Very nice Reserve,  we saw a small crocodile and lots of lizards"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,An excellent cycling and walking leisure destination

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One forgotten place in singapore that many had missed. One should visit this place at least once in your life time.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to get closer with nature. Very relaxing sea breeze and a good place for walking exercise.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Neo tiew crescent
Kranji way carpark c
Only google either of these 2.

For someone who only search sungei buloh wetland to visit for the first time. The general term will not bring you to the right entrance.

Parking is foc, water and toilet are provided foc as well."

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for family outing
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Recommended to go during low tides
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Spent 3 hours here doing all the walks and trails as well as searching for wildlife. Saw turtles, bats, a small crocodile, many Malaysian water monitors, fish, mudskippers, other small lizards, some birds and so many squirrels! Saw spiders too - just need to watch out and make sure you do not walk into their webs as some of them spread to the path. Many rest stops and toilet facilities. Good for some great exercise for those legs! I would come back here."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to contact with natural
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great outback place.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Saw many crocodiles

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for weekend visit
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for a scenic hike
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Monitor Lizard
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Migratory Bird Trail was a great experience. If you're lucky a crocodile might even say hi to your oblivion.

Place is full of mosquitoes, so you might wanna get some repellent on standby.

Receptionist(Malay lady with slight red highlights on her hair) at Wetland Centre was so kind and helpful.Gave me a map before trailing on the Mangrove Boardwalk.Not much to see in the mangrove here, though the boardwalk gives you the 'vacation resort' vibe.

Walking on the Coastal Trail,you'll observe  onion-shaped observation hides which are picturesque enough for your IG.

Lastly, the Mid-canopy walk would perform better as a prequel to a jungle playground as its bouncy effect is a plus for playful (grown) children.

Overall,a good starting point for 'to-be-one-with-nature' hippies in rat-racing Singapore."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Good place to learn about the mangrove forests and the ecosystem
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"The wetlands section was great, saw several 6ft+ monitor lizards on the paths and several birds around the water, tho unfortunately didn't see any crocs (despite the multitude of warning signs!). Bit surprised at the amount of litter that the reserve has to contend with and is at the mercy of the river.  Definitely give the mangrove and coastal walks a miss tho, not worth the time in the heat and don't compare to the wetlands section"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Cool place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,my sister got chomped up by a crocodile and there was alot of mosquitoes but it was nice change of pace in the lifestyle very cool
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Really depends on luck to see some wild animals for this place, saw a cobra, croc right  infront of me."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wild
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"natural place to watch birds, especially from Oct to Nov"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Lots to see. Relaxing walk.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Lot to explore here. Aquatic and marshy land creatures are easily seen like Big lizards and crocodile.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,1,"We arrived at the Visitors Centre at 4 pm yesterday 18 April 2020 and was told that the reserve was closed due to ""thundering"" and all visitors must leave. It was not raining at that time.They wont even allow us to wait as they say attraction will not be reopened even though the closing time is at 7 pm. Highly disappointed as the Wetland is far from the city centre. Another couple who had arrived at the centre by taxi ($30) had to rebook a return cab without seeing the attraction. I think the center should let the visitors decide if they want to risk the rain and not act like a nanny every time. We went to the Botanic Gardens after leaving the place and even though it was ""thundering "" too the Gardens were not closed."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,All farm closed
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Good for a leisurely 1.5hr walk. Go in the early morning hours at around 6-7am for a better chance to see some wildlife
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to go with kids and enjoy time in nature.Spotted crocodile,lizards,snails,birds,mud skippers, stingrayand lot many fishes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Come and visit this place and see some reptile and bird wildlife from Singapore. You might be lucky like us, and even spot a crocodile."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice greenery spaces.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Wonderful wildlife just outside of the city hustle and bustle. We saw crocodiles, bats, monitor lizards and lots of cool mudfish (fish that can scoot across land and breathe air). Go when it isn't too hot."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Cosy n fresh air especially during covid19, it is a good place for fresh air"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wide open spaces.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Face to face with wild life and crocodiles
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Quiet place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"I do love this place, but you need to bring a mosquito repellent!!!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nature walk. Bird watch.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Amazing place for hiking with beautiful coastal scenery. Walking distance is not too long so you won’t get exhausted.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,there are alot of animals here and we can learn he historical of that place itself.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Fresh air..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"One of the best conservation efforts I feel made by Singapore Government. This place can be dangerous as there are snakes and crocodiles but most of the time, they do not come out. My favourite place to visit during my free time. Very tranquil and it a great way to get away from the bustling city landscape."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,If your lucky you guys can see crocodiles and mud skipper
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Quiet place and place where you still can connect with nature within busy city. The only cons was there isnt a place where you can shower after visiting .
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,peace of mind
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's a lovely place to enjoy nature, immerse in the sounds, sights and smells.. spot a croc, spot a snake and spot lots a birds, from egrets, herons to Kingfishers, Sea eagles and ospreys."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,There are crocodiles here! And you can wave at JB where the cheap stuff are but we can't go.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of best place for photographers
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Smaller than I imagined but very good place to spend a day. Lots of birds, butterflies, crocodiles and views, walks boardwalks. Not always well signed. Water and snacks available. Visitors centre."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,It rained when we visited but we saw monitor lizards up close on the paths so it was pretty exciting after all
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"The closest thing to a walk on the wild side in cosmopolitan Singapore. Highlight of the visit - Komodo size monitor lizard lumbered towards us, got us all hot and bothered."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A gem
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Good place to for an outing
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Super relax!!!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great Nature Walk with Young Nautilus. Exploring of mangrove.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for family
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Oh simply interesting!! Learn many things and improve my nature knowledge. Good place to exercise walking and see many birds, crocodile, insects and so on. Good place for weekends. Can see buildings of our neighbor country. Nice."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,A place to go for nature lovers
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,No mosquitos surprisingly. Two parking sites.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Beautiful place!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Amazing place to be in the natural surroundings, wonderful views of the sea , JB skyline, absolutely amazing place to go for a walk /run in the nature with all the natural environments and wildlife/birds etc. You either just sit in silence absorbing all the natural sounds and vibrations of the nature.
Migratory birds come here in big numbers during the the month of September to March and it's a must see spectacle. And the park has made very good arrangements for the general public to watch the birds. KUDOS to national parks..  !!!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to visit
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Not much migratory birds today.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Fantastic set up. Incredible to see the diversity of native biodiversity in the reserve. We were rewarded by a wonderful sighting of a pair of otters. Lots of birds but weren't lucky to sight crocodiles or king cobra.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"It's definitely a good place to experience nature. One set back is in the gallery. There's good documentary on the TV but there is no sitting area to sit and watch. Why? There's a person sitting at the entrance of the gallery but he knows no info about the place, a bit unusual."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very peaceful and serene place. You can spend hours together watching the reptiles in the mangrove. Good place to learn more about the mangrove forest.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good place to enjoy nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Perfect natural forest. Many bird species here.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,The dos and dons should also be posted on the visitor centre along Kranji side. The place is now filled with people having picnics all over the reserve !!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Something different from the city. You can find a lot of avid nature photographers here. Some are even cool enough to share hidden and obscure sights e.g. baby crocodile perched on a semi submerged log on the swamp bank.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is the only paradise for bird photographers in Singapore for nailing down some ultimate bird actions. This place attracts a lot of migrant birds during the seasons and we can grab a number of them form here. You would need a good telephoto zoom lens if you are really serious about photography. Because the birds would be quite far from your reach. The best time to explore this place is early morning at 7am till 9am. By then the birds will move to other resting places from their fishing zone. The entrance is completely free and not an over crowded place. As this is a place for bird watchers and photographers the place will be quite calm in the morning and everyone is so inclusive to each other. You can find people carrying huge lenses for snapping the fishing. The walk is around 2 km long around this wetland and you will find various spots where the birds occupy in the morning. There are a number of observatories and shelters around the wetland for hiding and watching the birds. You may carry some water along otherwise you might get exhausted. There are few vending machines and restrooms near the entrance so you can get water from there itself. Also as this place is near the Singapore boarder, you can get a very close view of Malaysia from here. Please check my pics here for more related views."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place for walks and you will find surprised. Bat family.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good for nature lovers.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"It's been a pleasure walking around at the wetland reserve. Although not as scenic as other countries, it's still a good place for you to take a walk. This place provides something different from the parks you visit under your apartment house. There's this wooden onion like structure located there, it's a pretty photogenic spot for those who like to snap selfies. Overall a good experience."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Great for a walk!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Pretty nice place in Singapore to go if you're into nature - you do get to see migratory birds at times. Go on weekdays if you'd like more peace and quiet.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place for a walk with nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good place.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Amazing amazing nature! You won’t realize you are still close by the city till you saw high rises right in front of your eyes pass the mangrove.

Abundance of animals: crabs climbing on tree roots, crocodile, lizards, birds and monkeys.

The trails is quite extensive. Although they could do a better job cleaning the city junk in the mangrove and provide better maintenance service (vendor machine out of stock)."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice mangrove reserve... I love the resting points built to look like onions (or nests apparently). It's really far but I guess something nice and low cost to do with the family
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"We came here on Saturday morning and took the bird trail.  We were lucky to meet three crocodiles at different locations.  We also saw the mudskipper, monkey family of three, crab, spider and iguanas.  It was an unexpectedly fruitful trip."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Suitable for family
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Managed to catch a glimpse of some of the wildlife.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,beware of stray dogs
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of the best places to catch sight of migratory birds. Quiet and close to nature. Only problem is transportation out of the place. A bit difficult to get taxis.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Love the nature!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,goodd
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Must visit
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's Singapore's first ASEAN Heritage Park, whatever that means. This place is filled with mudflats, mangroves ponds and forests filled with plenty of wildlife. Expect to see water monitors and migratory birds and crocodiles if you're lucky."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"For bird watching, You may see crocodile as well sometimes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Enjoyed my first experience here. Had a delightful morning walk though the trails. Took about 4 hours at a light pace to cover the entire park. Can be shorter if you just do part of it.
Saw some monitor lizards, chipmunks, spiders, mudskippers, birds. Didn't manage to see a crocodile sadly.
Tip: try to catch the low tide period which is much better for seeing animals. Bring some snacks and drinks if you're staying for awhile. Binoculars and cameras are useful.
It's fairly safe to walk around. It's not easy to spot the animals if you're not experienced but keep your eyes and ears open. Generally safe, the ground is fairly level and easy to walk."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"If you are a hardcore nature fan or a bird watcher, then you will love this place. But if you are a casual nature lover or more of an animals guy like me, then this place might not be THAT worth it. It is very far from the « city » and will make you feel how big Singapore really is. It is free so no matter what, you are getting your money’s worth."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"Phone signal is easily lost and converted to the malaysia side. Difficult to book grab, gotta rely on the bus services if you want to leave the area. Otherwise it is a decent place to take a walk in the nature. Lots of flies in the mangroves, not much wildlife could be spotted."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Very cool place...relaxing....
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Awesome place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place to walk
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nice place, don't miss it not so far away from town, there is a public transport reach there, over all its wonderfulI caught the bum boat out to the island, and walked to the wetland reserve. It was quite a long way, 10km return. The sounds of the tropical forest were gorgeous. All the way there I had the road to myself except for a couple."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Have been guiding here since 1993. Every visit is a different experience. For  visitors who can only spare about 2-3 hrs. I would recommend the Mangrove Boardwalk, Main Bridge n Main Hide. Good period to visit Aug to April it being the migration period. Time to visit from 0700-1000 or 1700-1900 where it's cooler."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"One of the Great natural place have seen in Singapore,looks just not explored as other natural places may just because of Crocodile:) yes can find easily on edge.just need to be careful.overall it's very good for bird lovers and photographer."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"What a great place to go spend a few hours communing with nature. We went here in the morning and stayed for several hours. We loved seeing the environment and the wildlife. It was so peaceful and pleasant here that we could have easily spent yet a few more hours. We saw a lot of birds and reptiles while there and if we spent more time I am sure we would have spotted more. They have great blinds and elevated stands along the path and water that allow you to watch the birds without disturbing the environment too much. All of the paths are well maintained and easy to walk. The only two downsides were that there is a bit of garbage in the water that floats in from the oceans which makes you a bit sad, and it is also a bit of a challenge to get a ride out from the reserve."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A 'new' amazing discovery that Singapore has such rich, beautiful, natural habitat in our island of concrete jungle. Absolutely awed !"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Really nice place, well managed with a lot of birds to see. Be careful of the lizards, they are sometimes difficult to see.

The only ""negative"" point that I see here would be that some people should understand that, in a nature reserve, when people want to observe animals, it is better to avoid making too much noise."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Best kept secret in Singapore!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Interesting place for a walk in a Mangrove. Great Wildlife. Be quiet and listen closely for amazing bird songs.  Watch out for crocks.
Tip: Even if your going to take a car home, Note the time the buses come, and grab a bus back to civilization, where you can grab a car more easily. The bus comes only every 2 hrs and the nearest uber or taxi will take 20 min to call."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Great place to go to for a 2-3 hour walk, also great place for all kinds of photographers. If you want to have an actual chance of spotting an aligator you should come during regular office hours mid-week when the crowd is smallest and wildlife gets a bit more brave. Otherwise you can still spot some amazing giant lizards, squirrels, and lots of spiders (don't worry- these are mostly st. Andrew's spiders- very good at catching flies but not venomous)"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,2,Super pleas
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Must place to visit and again
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Offers you unique flora and fauna. Surrounded by the tranquil sea,with sound of waves crashing onto the shore, it gives you energy to complete your adventure. Admire singapore's last mangrove forest and other endangered species.  Walk in the towering trees and  beautiful flowers smelling great altogether. Plenty of tents to rest and hydrate yourself. See the fish, tadpoles and turtles swimming slowly in the wetlands. Breathing in the fresh air, it is simply a pleasure. Absolutely worth a visit."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nature North side of Singapore
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Its really close to nature; mangroves, birds, fish,  crocodiles.
Please remember If you are with your kids, all paths are not that stroller friendly ( unless u have one with bigger wheels). But kids may enjoy the bumpy road( my one did :) ).
Don't forget to get some mosquito repellent ( there are places on the way that u will find those annoying mosquitoes)
There are lots of places to rest on the way.
Bring water, snacks, umbrella ( just in case if rain) and ENJOY the nature in rural Singapore."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Go during low tide to see the crocodiles 🐊!
Beautiful nature reserve, you can spend all day there enjoying the wildlife, plants and river, and there is no entrance fee."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nature
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Hadn't been up here in more than 10 years and they've really expanded it and added more walks so now you can get off the bus and walk right in. One of my favourite places in Singapore, calm, peaceful and plenty of wildlife to see."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"A very nice location north of Singapore - my friend and I saw monitor lizards, a few species of birds, two big crocodiles, otters and a group of bats... I enjoyed my visit there even though the sea between Malaysia and Singapore brings trash to the Reserve and that's really sad... Nice and relaxing walk, would recommend it to spend few hours outside of the city!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Free parking.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Free ticket but not much animals there
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A idle place for short distance trekin for 1st time trackers.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Singapore Wildlife
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Parking lot: Yes, for motorcycles and cars
Toilet: Yes
Vending machine: Yes
Cycling: No"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"To me its the best nature park in singapore 😅
you can spot many migratory birds, during the season (Sep to Feb)
there is also the resident crocs.
You will not miss the monitor lizards with big fat bellies.
The air is good, and I do not find that there are many mozzies."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place for a weekend stroll. The place is crawling with Biodiversity. You might even get lucky to see a few crocodiles when crossing the bridge over. Enjoy the stroll. The place is getting busier from people who are escaping city life for a breather.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Inaccessible, unless you drive. It’s does not look like anything else in Singapore. Nature reserve, the first building you see is quaint and guides you through the whole park. Really nice walk. Mosquitoes are a problem."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Well maintained nature park. Well designed.. Needs keen eye or experienced guide to spot many well camouflaged marine life or birds. For bird watching will need to take note of migration period.. Cos we went during this time not many birds maybe it's not the migration season.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Yes. Closer to animal. Ww spotted 2 crocodile
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,best place
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Great place to see real wildlife within Singapore.  Best visited in the early morning before the day heats up - very active bird and animal life in a wild setting.  Good walkways for all levels.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Free parking and free entry.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Love the wetland and coastal walks. Remember to make sure your phone is not on international roaming as you will get locked into Malaysian mobile networks!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Lovely man fave us a map and advice. Beautiful nature reserve with lots of wildlife. Some work going on at the moment so less to see.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"I always enjoy a walk here as it a good change from the city. This is a good place to learn more about the flora and fauna in Singapore. If you are lucky and observant, you might even get to spot the crocodiles and snakes."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is an oasis of peace and tranquility. Great for seaside walks, watching wetland wildlife or watching rare migratory birds. Once you visit, I assure you that you will be back for more"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very good
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Very quiet and peaceful. Don't expect it to be a happening place. Might encounter crocs in water

Not suitable for toddler under 5years old."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Wildlife sanctuary for migratory birds in Singapore
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Coolest place but wear insect repellant unless you want a day of
Itchy skin."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Its literally the only place in Singapore with wild crocodiles!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Many shorebirds here during high tide during migration time.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Untouched nature reserve
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Excellent place but nearly impossible to get to via public transportation.  There is a nearby bus stop but there are days it doesn’t run and when it does run there are very long waits between busses.  And if you decide to walk 20 mins in the hot sun to the next nearest bus stop there is no side walk and people drive VERY fast. There is a shuttle bus called the Kranji express I think but the bus driver can’t speak English and refused to take my money and wouldn’t let me board for some reason I couldn’t understand.  Just kept saying no no.  There is nowhere close for food although the shuttle bus would have been and option.  Also it is nearly impossible to get a Grab at certain times. Once I was stuck there for two hours after volunteering.  Seems like the LTA should get the public transportation to work better or at least decrease the speed limit for safety if people have to walk. Seems like it would be difficult for tourists.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,3,"The walk around the mangrove is very easy and flat. The place seems to be really good for bird lovers though! We also spotted a crocodile in the river. It's a nice change of scenery, but nothing to write home about. I still prefer MacRitchie."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Crowded.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"A pocket sized piece of nature right on our doorsteps. A lovely place to go for a walk, jog (very flat and soft but firm surface) or picnic with the family. You can see a large range of animals and birds in their wild setting. We saw 3 beautiful hornbills, numerous crabs and mud skippers, carp, kingfishers and Weaver Birds. The ground staff and Rangers are very friendly and chatty and it's a wonderful place to see and learn about mangroves."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Well maintained park, good place for photography of birds, flora and fauna. Very pretty mangrove sanctuary, which is a rare sight nowadays."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Had a great day out with my family. We saw a variety of fishes, even spotted few crocodiles and river monitors. This is a great place to be close to nature."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Simply love the nature, quietness and diversity of wildlife. Make sure you bring a long a good camera or binoculars and food!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice nature park
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Features true nature of greenery with wildlife such as monkeys, boars, iguanas, snakes appearing every now and then."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to hang out on the weekends. A bit far from the city. But worth to visit. We've got to see the crocodile and birds.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,A wonderful change of scenery and pace from main Singapore. The tropical forest made for an interesting hike. The wetlands themselves are a fascinating sight with flat terrain and various animal species.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Lots of crocodiles. Free entry.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,By far the best national park in Singapore! Beautiful nature and stunning (and stinging) wildlife. A must do for every nature lover and alike!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,It's very nice and safe place to go XD. GO THERE IS VERY GOOD AND DONT MISS IT
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"It's wonderful that urban Singapore has an unspoilt corner full of wildlife and original wetlands. We spent half a day there and saw a chameleon, squirrels, monitor lizards, bats, mudskippers small and giant, spiders, insects, and lots of birds and fishes. My British guest was fully immersed in the wildlife experience and enjoyed herself very much.
Perhaps a hot drink dispenser would be a great help. No food is being sold there and as we spent a longer time than intended, we were quite hungry by the time we ended at almost 7pm, closing time. We walked out of the migratory birds route (opposite end of entrance) to the bus stop of 925# to find it non-operational on weekdays. With almost trembling legs, we walked 30min by the road to the bus stop of 925. Exhausting end to an otherwise great day. Perhaps if bicycles or buggy transport could be arranged for visitors during weekdays, that would aid tired legs from the long trudge."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Go early morning! Best during low tide to see crocodiles! There is a water cooler at the entrance to the reserve but please bring your own water if you wanna take your time to explore and enjoy the place as well as to discover interesting creatures not seen in our urban environment!
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"I love this place , away from city life"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Nature experiences has to be there, our country has this to offer just get there now. Before you are too old to love this place."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Distant from any civilisation, this is the closest to true nature in Singapore. Few come here, making it a very quiet and lonesome place to visit. A personal favourite for a person who detests crowd, like me.

Few activities include: walking along boardwalk and trails, birdwatching, chatting with a friend as you walk.

Wear insect repellent."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Wetlands are under appreciated. Yet, they are vital to the health of an ecosystem. Examples fish nurseries, waste recycling, land stabilization i.e. protects against land erosion. Sungei Buloh has been lovingly preserved. There are well constructed walkways to enable visitors to walk into the wetlands without getting their feet wet. Also hideouts to observe the birds as they feed on the diverse marine life during low tide. Certainly recommend this as one of the must visit places in Singapore. Kudos to National Parks for making Sungei Buloh accessible."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,With my new friends
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Decent wildlife for a nature reserve situated in an island city state surrounded by concrete jungles. Need more than 1 visit to see more different types of fauna due to tidal changes during the day. Weekdays should be ideal cos there will be less people & less noisy children to scare away the wildlife. Proper footwear is recommended especially after & during wet weather, certain pathways get pretty slippery.
An overall positive experience. Very educational."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Had a great time at the reserve with my family! Seen lots of monitor lizards, birds, crabs, swarms, fishes at its most natural state. However, be warned, be prepared for the trip. Cos, once in, its a long way out. It will be worst if it rains. Bring water, some bites, mosquito repellant, sunscreen, and most importantly, visit the washroom before you begin the journey. Have fun!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Main walking trails remain open. The observatories are closed
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nice place to see the migratory birds and to learn more about the nature reserve and its ecosystem.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Painstaking conservation of wet lands was an emerging trend in the late 90'summer there the country realized their bio diversity. Worth a visit. Meet crocodiles and snakes and turtles live and in front of you !
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Nature at its best
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is one place filled with rich biodiversity; a wetland with an extensive mangrove forest. You can find macro photographer enthusiasts coming here for photo shoots weekdays and weekends. There are also a large of of bird photographers too! This place becomes a hunting place for these 2 groups of photographers.

You can spend the day here knowing you are safe here with the presences of all these photographers. Do bring you own light snacks and drinks as there are no food vendors here. However, DO keep the place clean and do NOT litter. There are bins for you to throw away you empty bottles etc..."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Nice place to see. Can even see Johor across the strait.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"If you would like to enjoy the marshy lands this is one of the best places. You can see birds, crocodiles at this park. For whole journey take one to two hours. Different flavour compared to other nature parks."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Greenery and lots of animals
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Keep the kid entertain
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Ok
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Been here twice: once for an event organized by NTU Earthlink and once for an outing with friends. The paths are clearly marked and easy to follow. The place seems to be well-maintained. Family friendly
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of Singapore's nature reserve. Good place to observe and admire the mangrove swamp whether at high tide or low tide. A huge variety of flora and fauna the can be found.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"You really feel like you're in a nature park here. The jungle is not manicured as in other parks, and there's a plethora of interesting flora and fauna to keep you busy for hours on end. My favorite spot in Singapore!"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Good to have a walk in the nature park..just remember to bring insect repellant..
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"Lovely bit of wetland to spend a few hours in. You'll see different species of shore birds and monitor lizards, and if you're lucky, saltwater crocs, hornbills, and snakes as well"
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,"This is one of the four nature reserves in Singapore. It is a haven for shorebirds during the migratory season (sep-mar), which is great for many birdwatchers and nature lovers, as well as being a highly educational place. The boardwalks and hides are nicely built and regularly maintained. One of the biggest highlights there are the crocodiles."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,Best to go early morning. It takes about 2 hours for a leisure walk. Walk along the coastal track first and forest track back.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,Wild crocs aplenty
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,"Its a plesant walk from the information centre along the coastal or forest trail to the education centre. Note that the bus from kranji drops off here on sunday and public holidays only, otherwise its the carpark near the infotmation centre across the causeway of kranji bay. Beyond the education centre is a walkway around former srimp ponds with many hides and viewing screens. Early is best and it is tidal if you are looking for waders. Midweek its quite quiet and some local knowledge is probably very helpful. Guides are listed on the national parks website."
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,4,The closest you can feel the nature together with family. Good for kids.
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,5,One of my favourite places in Singapore. Beautiful.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Pretty solid mall in the belt of orchard since 20-30 years ago. I still enjoy their food-hall at B2, they also have a Cold Storage groceries store there.

Basically, you can get all your luxury wants fulfilled shopping here with brands such as Hermes, LV, Chanel etc.

It’s also a stone throw away from ION Orchard shopping mall for newer alternatives."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Fabulous shopping center with lots of Japanese food and stuffs to buy. It's quite big and spacious and for those who are tourists can get lost inside if they are not familiar with the building. Fantastic food court at B2 with variety of food sections and bakery stuffs.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Best Shopping Mall ( for Me ) with Several Faves !
New Ones too !!"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Takashimaya food hall

Nothing as nostalgic as these “ fish” pancakes.
A little sweet due to the over generous amounts of red bean fillings but still a temptation always .
Go for the matcha red bean fish pancake.

Then head to the curry puff stall for that flaky and light curry puff. Best eaten hot !"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Yummy cookies which is great for gifting. Very pleasant staff and expiry date is about one month after so it is very fresh. Great with coffee/tea...
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"I always love shopping at Takashimaya, the salespeople are very helpful every time I go there
Even when I'm just there to check something& haven't decided whether or not to buy, they answer questions & give recommendations
I've also bought luggage before& when I came back to buy another one, the sales person remembered me"
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Human traffic has reduced dramatically due to this pandemic times. Good for us with young children to window shop without worrying losing our kids in the crowd.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Nice classy place to shop for high end products!
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Nice shopping center with big area and including food court is convenience for visitors.  Located at Orchard Road is easy to access all business area.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"This place is an institution. Classy. But best of all, my favorite ice cream uncle is parked outside. I always grab my durian ice cream and rainbow bread for $1.20 and I sit in the adjacent phone booth and eat it. Thank you Takashimaya."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"The mall in Singapore which is located at the heart of Town (Shopping Town), and where you can find everything and is connected to all the major shopping malls. Come here to look for day to day stuffs, food, groceries, products, wears, mid end, high end, luxury shopping. A must come to place if you are looking to buy and shop!"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Went there today mainly for toys section. Wide range of products. Sanrio gift gate is rather large too.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Takashimaya is a great place to get away from it all.  Fantastic shops and great places to eat!  Very easy to spend quite a bit of time just browsing around doing a bit of shopping at the many luxury shops.
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Still one of the big shopping mall in Singapore... Any high end luxury goods u looking for are all here... Plus the Japanese takashimaya occupied one side of the four level... One of the left over book store kinokuniya on the top floor... With all others malls coming up, this is still one to go to when u are in orchard road..."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Love this place. Have been here since I was a teenager. Nothing much has changed. Still as good. Christmas shopping is a breeze with so much on offer here.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,This has got to my favourite shopping mall in the entire Singapore! all inclusive with an amazing supermarket selection. Both branded and local fares.

Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Just went to basement food village and good to know some of the old stalls still there, Fried Carrot Cake and Yong Tau Foo, plus a Korean Kimchi and Street Food stall.

Takashimaya Singapore,5,A regular spot for your essential shopping with lots of varieties to choose from. Great food selection too
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Takeaway at Tampopo.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"This shopping mall in my opinion feels like the most well balanced between a tourist high end shopping mall like ion & a localized shopping experience.

There is my favourite food level at the basement giving many japanese street food & snack options & bakery which sells very popular french bread.

There's your normal shopping all upstairs & I feel there's a level which everyone would enjoy of different age classes"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Arguably the best bookshop in SG! English, Chinese and Japanese books are well stocked. Orchard Road location."
Takashimaya Singapore,1,Not recommend - Terrible experience getting bed sheets from Cavelli. Was approached by a Sales staff and assured that the quality is good and that it will not require any ironing. Bought the sheets and it’s probably the more wrinkled sheets I have bought and sheets start to turn furry after one wash. Ended up using only once.
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Big busy department  store with all price ranges & many brands.  Fun to walk around in the department store.  Department stores & malls are still popular in Asia.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Always gotta stop by when I'm near to buy some nomnoms. Sad that the matcha ice cream is gone though ="")"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Still open as usual, no more middle event area.."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Many branded luxury shops to visit. As well as other popular shops & stores. The crowd is so less & place is quiet due to Covid 19.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Good place to hunt for Japanese food and stuff. Many branded boutique are here and the Takashimaya stuff has plenty to offer for all ages.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Love the eateries at the takashimaya basement! Variety of food to choose, from bakery to dessert."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"You must go and experience this place, Taka as it’s known in our house is one of our favorite places in all of Singapore. Great shopping from designer clothing to cheaper alternatives, baby clothes and one of the nicest and cleanest changing rooms for babies you will ever see. We spend a lot of time in B2, B1, and the 4th floor.

Do all our Christmas shopping here!"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great place to do your shopping and eating but best not to drive because parking can be expensive.

Takashimaya Singapore,1,"There were too many shop staff members & just kept chatting each other. Also, casher didn't speak English & kept saying something in non English language even though I asked to speak English many times. Quite annoying...."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Favourite mall... Good variety of shops and everything that you want to find is under one mall.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,we come here early to visit the CNY festive booth at B2 and see what we can buy for CNY. Lots of variety and there are early bird discount too. Not too crowded yet but I think weekend will start to be busy. Come try . Check out all  the special stores

Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Excellent department store that offers nearly everything that one would want in a departmental store, and has excellent variety of food in the basement, B2 and has a number of special eateries that are unique to Takashimaya only.

Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Takashimaya Departmental Store can be considered an all in one shopping mall. From cosmetics at level 1 to children toys at level 3, you can find all you want here. Food section can be found at basement 1. As a Japanese company, employees will be briefed before work and greets each customer with a smile and a bow once the gates are raised at 1100hrs. During Covid19, they have ensured safe distancing and strict measures for every customer's safety. Definitely a shopping experience here! : )"

Takashimaya Singapore,4,Love Japanese food from the Cold Storage it always fresh n value for money.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Will easily get lost, but once you get familiarised it's fine. Staff around are very unfriendly and will only act nice to you if they think you're rich.

Takashimaya Singapore,5,Tasty cheesy pasta with cod fish and sausage
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Probably Singapore’s favourite department store. An offshoot of the original Takashimaya in Tokyo, Takashimaya is located in Ngee Ann City and spans six floors. It is persistently crowded, even though prices are not as good as online, and I suspect that is because everyone is using their shopping vouchers that was redeemed from their credit card points."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great shopping place. We love to shop here
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Nice display of goods within Ngee Ann City but having separate QR codes for Safe Entry.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Just dropped by the food festival at Takashimaya Food Hall and I got to try so many authentic treats and tea from Taiwan! The bag and hat I’m wearing is actually dyed with tea leaves, how cool is that?🍃

Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Spread over every level in Ngee Ann City, this mall is so big that my hubby and kids will not come along for the fun. They will be a total wreck after an outing here. So it’s a good trick if you want some alone time.

Well, it’s laid out like every other mall, but it’s the acreage that sets this mall apart. How do they do this? It is just cavernous. Great fun for me to see all the things here. Never fail to bring something back for me."

Takashimaya Singapore,4,"One of my favorite department stores on this island as it is conveniently located in the heart of Orchard Road shopping district. A wide range of goods from clothing,  household utensils, bedding, etc. I particularly enjoy visiting the Food Hall that holds food fairs following the seasonal foods available in Japan with plenty of samplings from the various food vendors participating in the food exhibition. Another favorite is the Japanese-French Boulangerie DONQ that bakes delicious Mentaiko Baguette and other yummy pastry items. You can smell the fragrant yeast in the air as you approached this popular bakery that is often crowded with customers who enjoy good quality bread."

Takashimaya Singapore,4,Close exactly at 8pm. Don't expect you can still shop after 7:45pm.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great place great food
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Super crowded! Surely many people are still shopping for Christmas gifts even during this pandemic.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,like it.. everything can buy...
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Very big mall in orchard with wide range of stores
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great  place  for book fans
Takashimaya Singapore,5,An all in one department store with a wide variety of shops catering to different likes -such as golf and electronics- and a wide variety of food options to satisfy the hungry shopper. The department store itself stocks a wide variety of merchandize. A true Christmas shopper's paradise with wonderful decorations and varied promos.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Good place to shop. Good food. Good wine shop.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,This a great place for a classic experience
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Pretty popular place for shopping but infrastructure is pretty old
Takashimaya Singapore,1,Driving to the car park of this mall is really a nightmare. It is always jammed 365 days every year.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Lovely Japanese department store with amazing
wide range of quality products. Food hall is eye opening and don’t miss out on coffee break treats at Dar El Bacha - delightful!"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Large upmarket shopping destination in orchard road, good food centre, many brands and boutiques. Ample but expensive parking."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good place but too crowded.
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Normal, as we stop by at the Swaroski Crystal stall and bought some Nespresso cups only."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,A lot things to buy. Many sales
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Nice place for shoping ...
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good department store and food court.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Love to shop there as many brands to choose from and the staffs are friendly, recommend Irene from Lesportsac at Lvl 1. Good customer service"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Love Takashimaya. They have almost everything but a bit pricey but they have all the unique and most modern technology stuff. So cool. But price can be cheap if they are on sales. For tourist do check Takashimaya out. For local go get some good bargain
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good place to buy branded goods and get some Japanese snacks and food in the basement. Can be pricey.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Large shopping mall. Has clothes, restaurants, sports equipment, kitchen, groceries. Everything you need in a very large shop."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Totally happening mall
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great location to shop and dine. There is a super nice japanese restaurant serving all kinds of fish. Nakajima Suisan is located at B2 inside corner
Takashimaya Singapore,1,"Went there on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. Unbelievably crowded with not much to offer.
I went to the shoe section where I wanted to try on a pair of working shoes in a size 10 but the staff curtly brushed me off. I guess she had far too many to handle at the same time so I left. Overall not a fruitful and quite a useless shopping experience for a Japanese departmental store.
My advise is to probably visit on a weekday or head to HK or even Malaysia for a better shopping experience"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Awesome 👌
Takashimaya Singapore,4,quite busy but not crazy. Takashimaya is always a dependable shopping destination
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Always love it to come. Very friendly and professional service.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Sale good quality
Takashimaya Singapore,4,One of the best place to shop for sales during Christmas. The festive mood is amazingly good. Lots of good F&B outlets.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Gund, Baby Gund and Gund's Sesame Street Plush Toys all available!"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Leave your cards at home especially if you go with your girlfriend or wife.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Great department store. Carried variety of brands from apparels to home goods.  Easy to get around and has good food court and grocery shopping as well.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,This department store really looks grand and luxurious! We spent hours browsing through the places as they have many different types of asia items especially the Japanese stuff. The food court and grocery in the basement are my favourite haunt as they have huge varieties of food and many stuff :)
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Good to visit if you buying toys for kids. Else it is a boring place now.
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"The department store is fine but the big attraction is the food court in the basement.
There is a wide rage of food all of which is of a good standard.
Just avoid the busy lunch time."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,More on the pricey end but good place to have a walk around
Takashimaya Singapore,5,nice place to shop
Takashimaya Singapore,5,It's always pleasure to shop here
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Located at Orchard Road.
Business opened : 10am - 10pm.
People like to shop here because there are varieties of products and good foods. At B2  there are lots of Japanese foods.There is also a cold storage supermarket and many individual outlets selling breads, pastries, cookies, deep fry bananas, sweet potatoes, curry puff, chocolates, cakes, ice cream etc.In the basement there is a food court with lots of food options."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"as much as takashimaya seems like a very 'atas' place for luxury shopping, it also has many delicious food shops for foodies as well!! this is good for people who's friends/family like to shop but they themselves couldn't be bothered 🤪 you can chill at a restaurant or buy a snack to eat while walking around :)

takashimaya has many retail shops with a wide variety of different products, this ranges from body lotions (eg bath and body works) to clothes (eg. zara). there is also the humongous department shop which sells basically EVERYTHING (eg. toys, kitchenware) you need/want so it's almost like a one-stop-shop for shoppers which makes it very convenient for people who are on the lookout for different types of products as you can find it all in one shop instead of travelling to multiple.

another thing i LOVE about takashimaya other than the shopping is shopping but for FOOD 😋  the bottom level of takashimaya's department stall(food hall)is literally dedicated to food and food only. takashimaya has many delicious food stalls which are mainly japanese-western fusion. the snacks, bakery, and desserts sold are also to DIE for. many bakeries which are well known for their mouth-watering bread are located inside the food hall as well as many other dessert and snack shops.

i could honestly go on about the food but then this would be too long 😓. takashimaya is a great place to spend your day shopping and i find it unlikely that you would even be able to finish shopping because of how big it is. the only bad thing about this place is that it gets very crowded especially during peak days/hours and the shops are mainly catered towards shoppers who spend on more luxury items (those who have a higher budget/tourists?) this makes this place slightly more commercialised and therefore more expensive but i mean what did you expect? 🥴 so this place is not really suitable for regular shoppers who are just looking to shop to relax as it is way higher on the pricier side. i would say come here if you're here to maybe splurge on something as a gift or to treat yourself but otherwise not the best place to come and shop :/"
Takashimaya Singapore,1,Not friendly atmosphere
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Nice shopping place with various promo.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,As usual very crowded....must go early otherwise jam n hard to find parking lots...the yearly xmas tree is up in taka atrium
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Same old taka.. Only less crowded. 😁
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"I have visited this store several times and have never bought any female clothing from them. The nicer merchandise are all branded and expensive. In terms of customer service, they sure hire a lot of salespeople because they are everywhere. I think this store is good for their array of housewares and, definitely, their ladies shoes department is worth bragging about. Yes, I have been successful in finding affordable and well-made shoes there. I have also bought some of their mens sportswear before. It is a very well-stocked department store but if you are looking for moderately priced ladies clothing, this will not be my top go-to store."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great place to be without the crowd.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Nice:)
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Nice environment for shopping and food.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Crowded venue despite Covid virus 😥
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Come for lunch. Very crowded.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Got Venchi Chocolate
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Outstanding upscale shopping place. Great service. Price sometimes can be very competitive.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Orchard road is the go-to place for all things branded.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Love the food hall
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Oh man this place is full of different knicknacks from different parts of the world. You can easily get gifts for your friends be it food or items. Expect to spend about 2 to 3hours over here or even half a day if you haven't been. If you're with your wife then probably you will be here for at least half a day.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Love the toys department
Takashimaya Singapore,4,The last remaining major departmental store on Orchard Road
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Same atmosphere in Taka Japan. But they are good at marketing. Know what kind of things that Singapore people wants.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Big n good variety
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"A big department store selling everything you need. Usually quite crowded during weekends as it sells a variety of branded items. Prices are usually not the cheapest, thus it is recommended to compare the prices with other stores if you are price conscious.
Staff is  so-so. Sometimes it becomes a bit of a hassle to deal with pestering sales ladies.
I think ladies shoe section is the best one among all department stores in Singapore. Lots lots of variety..Also like their basement stalls selling snacks, sweets and green tea. Too bad they dont have salad stalls like they have in Japan."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Probably still one of the best place to shop in Singapore, with its wide range of goods, from affordable to premium.  In addition, the basement houses possibly  the most diverse range of eateries ( from Japanese, Western,  foodcourt & other ""finger"" food, including bakeries and other teas), not forgetting groceries supply from Cold Storage."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Love going here. There are tons of store and also got some delicious food💕
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Highly recommended. Always packed full of people, Basement of Takashimaya has lots of food stalls, a lot of customers and delicious well priced goodies. Worth a visit!"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Huge shopping centre. A lot of boutiques. Can find almost anything...
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Loves to shop in Takashimaya, Orchard. Good variety of products, and even wider range of food. Love the B2, where they have lots of Japanese street food or event. Good for family to shop here as there are a lot of household products at B1 level."
Takashimaya Singapore,3,It is very troublesome now to go shopping in Orchard....it is no longer smooth sailing to walk from 1 bldg to another...so many times of check in n check out. Quite a hassle esp when yr hp hung !
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"This is a great place to shop.  When you are tired and thirsty, I love Tokio fruit cafe. You can pay for premium Japanese fruits, but I really like the local cut fruits: juicy and sweet. Worth the try."
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Ok but normal items are costly
Takashimaya Singapore,5,So many choices
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Love it
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Always my fav shopping center in town! Big and well organized!
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"This is still my place to go for Japanese food-stuffs, which I look for as part of my annual Christmas shopping. They have an annual toy fair at the Basement Atrium too, which you should be able to get something for any little ones."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Oh good, stalls well spaced out & I like the displays. Sales people are courteous & informative about their products"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Awesome
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Takashimaya is located in prime location of Orchard Road, use circle line to reach this place. They have 5 floor of departmental store which offers you every thing by everything i meant everything. Its bit crowded on weekend so avoid visiting for any shopping purpose. Also it has fine Japanese Restaurants for dining Overall a great place to visit if you love Japanese culture. A must visit thing in Singapore"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Great food options in the B2 food hall!
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Best place for grabbing good food, and enjoying shopping. My parents really liked it a lot"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"If you like Japan you must come here. Can buy some Japanese brand only here! Such as make up brand on the grand floor or Royce chocolate  and snacks at B2, they also have fruit and vegetables from Japan in the supermarket. I like here also because they have a comfortable nursing rooms, you can go there with your newborns."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,B2 of the department store is buzzing but less crowded than pre-covid-19.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Super crowded despite covid
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Excellent.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Many food, drink and fashion options"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,One of shopping destinations in Asia....@ Orchard Road - Singapore
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"The best departmental store in Orchard area.
Many big brand stores can be found in it.
Many Japanese food and gifts can be purchased here.
Service is good and always crowded with people.
Always my favorite place to shop when I'm in town.
Good place to shop with family, can get clothing to electronic appliances in it."
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Very confusing and difficult to navigate around. Ended up getting that frustrated that I ended up spending all my time and energy just trying to get out. Would be more enjoyable if it was better signposted.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Decent shopping centre, very old but still has many good shops and food places, has a luxury shopping lane and a fast fashion store as well as adequate food options"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"The best shopping mall in the heart of Singapore...very exclusùve, very high end with lots of shops with reasonable, affordable prices..."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,High end Department store carrying expensive stuff which I mostly can't afford. However the 4 stars is for their basement 1 which sells a good range of affordable stationery and basement 2 which has food stores selling unique products.  I often come here to buy food gifts.

Takashimaya Singapore,4,Free parking
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"An outlet of the Japanese department store in Singapore - what's not to like. Fewer options than you'd find in Tokyo, but pretty good."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,One of the most spacious department stores in midtown Orchard. Great variety of products and impeccable service. Prices are great during sales n promotions period.
Takashimaya Singapore,3,Ok
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Great place to shop. Variety of food stalls but limited place to  seat and enjoy the food.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good place to shop in Singapore.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"A lots of housewares. All lots of unique things, but expensive."
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Staff attitudes have become less amiable and service oriented friendly akin to their brethren in Japan, I hope that the Japanese holdings of Takashimaya would come to audit service attitudes again."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"This is a throwback review. Went to buy Christmas presents for my team members.  It was really crowded and the gift packing station was really long queue. However the lady at counter 1(nearest to the Q) was very patience, friendly and professional in performing her duties, nicely wrapped and fast too. Really appreciated. Thank you for the good service."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"+ Reminds me of Japan AEON
- Lack of toilets"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,This mall and department store has really stood the test of time. The mall has been there for more than 25 years and is a unique addition to Orchard's flagship malls.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Very nice department store
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"If you know the iconic department store from Japan, then here you will find that same feeling of the one back in Japan. Beside the department store many nice boutique and one of my preferred Japanese restaurant in Singapore."

Takashimaya Singapore,5,Convenient
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Always having some event going on in the center atrium which I personally think is nice. Definitely a one stop place to satisfy all your fashion hunger needs.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Lot of variety and huge spread of things to choose from. Make sure do your homework of what you plan to buy. This place is great for retail therapy
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Too many people during the weekend
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Amazing store but to be honest this review is mainly for the basement. Tons of great food mainly from Japan and extremely delicious. Just go walk around and you will find something lovely whether you are craving savory or sweet.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,I like to buy my groceries at the basement cold storage because everything are fresh and presentable especially the pork knuckles and the black pepper chicken. Happen to shop around the basement stores and come across Kuekh Ho jiak. Tasted some of the items are freshly made and taste extremely good and delicious. Give it a thumb up
Takashimaya Singapore,5,The bookstore here is amazing
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Everything under one roof. Well connected to the heart of surrounding shopping malls. Good mix of high ends and medium price products
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Singapore, an island city-state off southern Malaysia, is a global financial center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,A very great and nice shopping place. Can get almost everything here though the prices may be slightly higher. However you can find some great bargains when they have sales or special offers. There's also a great food court at the basement. The place is conveniently located and within walking distance from the MRT.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Just go. Visit their Kitchenware department at the basement level. Towards the exit there's a bargain/sale corner. Happy hunting..
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"I love this bookstore. We can spend hours and hours looking for the rare pieces.
The french area is great with a super nice person in charge.
Do not wait and go there !"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Nice
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good good
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Love the supermarket on basement level.  There's a cold storage supermarket as well as many individual outlets selling bread, pastries cookies, chocolates, cakes, ice cream, curry puff (A1) is really good. There's also a food court as well as Japanese n Western style restaurant. A Japanese grill fish stall at a corner is really very popular as ther's always a long queue during dinner."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Very good control of distancing measures.  Staffs are friendly
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Nice shopping experience. Food court is nice with plenty of selections. Things are pricey though and worth it if they have some sale going on, especially at the Talking Hall."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Best iconic shopping mall since the mid 90s. I still recalled going there after school every now and then as it was such a large mall in those days with nice air conditioning. It has evolved to provide lots of luxury brands and also more affordable ones, and the main events hall having discounted items now and then. Lots of food selection as well. Parking is one of the best as the underground carpark is huge, but can be pricey depending on what time you go to park. Comparable in pricing with Paragon."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Our favourite shopping place! You can get everything you need from here. The food hall here is amazing, love the variety you can get."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Always my favourite departmental store. Takashimaya has everything you need, be it household items, kitchen appliances & kitchenwares, apparels & Accessories, travel needs, sports needs, supermarkets & F&B outlets. Takashimaya has them all!

Best time to shop to your merry, will be during their 10% members sale! Most brands & items will be on discounted prices & members get additional 10% off!"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"There are a lot of luxurious stores selling handbags to dresses. At Basement 2,tgere is a large area which will frequently hold events like selling toys to selling expensive jewelry. Once you are done with the shopping,you can head to the food courts which sell a lot of delicious food."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,I like curated each level is and the staff were really helpful and kind enough to explain it further when I did not understand something fully
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Due to Covid measures, you have to park at ngee Ann city and it's a long walk to Takashimaya store."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Best place to go for shopping and fine dining.  The complex boosts of a variety of fashion boutique and designer shops.  It even has  a supermarket at the basement to facilitate your basic needs.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Takashimaya is a planet on its own, you can spend hours and lose track of time easily. The place houses so many brands, there are offers going on everywhere. From most luxury brands to most local brands, you can find LV, Chanel to a 1A curry puff in the same building. Really impressed with Singapore and its infrastructure, really feel lucky to be a part of Singapore."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,I'm working takashimaya
Takashimaya Singapore,5,The grand dame of department stores in Orchard Road

It has best varieties of items compared to any other department store in Singapore. Located at orchards area which most of the tourist will go."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"an extensive place to browse goods, shopping, and dine. There is also a (usually crowded) food court with reasoble price and halal food. Ask the vendor if in doubt, they have knowledge and honesty to answer whether it is a halal food or not."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Although its so big that we have not completed all floors and shops, it has very smart layout in the mall. Nice deco and friendly staff. Very busy and can be crowded in different areas to give it a bit different flavor to the shopoing expected. Overall a very pleasant experience."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Downtown department mall where you could get mostly branded items here. And delicious Japanese food at B2.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Very crowded during the weekend.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"The food Fare is fabulous tho' the prices ain't. The Q at the new Bubble Tea Xin is pretty short at 2pm. At S$5+ for a tea, I don't think so."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good and big shopping mall! Has many brands inside the shoppi g mall like Levis Dockers and Timberland. Good place to shop for all that you need and there is also a kids section where there is a wide selection of toys. Staff are friendly and clothing there is of good quality. The food there is also nice
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"""ATAS"" 👌. Nice atmosphere-- good range stuff."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,A large departmental one stop store that you are able to find everything from homecare to skincare... including shoes n office wear.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,I like the food court at the level B2. I always come here for bun and cake. The cold storage has the BBQ section which serve tasty grill meat. The salad bar serve a bowl of salad with the price of SGD7.90.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"A beautiful and stunning place for a shopping spree. Different levels with different material delights! From bottom floor, which is the amazing food area to the top floor, with housing supplies and wonderful adorable decorations to fit your taste!

Takashimaya Singapore,5,no tree this year :(
Takashimaya Singapore,1,"No money how to go? Smoking area have to walk so far, sad"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Previously, i have bought PlayStation 2 machine and games. I have also mentioned about Ngee Ann City also. Please look at it. But at the same time a Japanese department store with Japanese restaurants and other Japanese products."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,So packed... Shop what you want here
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Mall with plenty of high end luxury stores and something else for everyone. The food mall has a lot of local food for anyone to buy in small portions and nibble on. I'd recommend visiting the event square where there are different theme events on a monthly basis.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Enjoyable shopping experience, whether you are looking to buy anything or just window shopping."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Affordable price... So good for shopping
Takashimaya Singapore,5,A famous department store located in the center of orchard road. A good place to do shopping for luxury brands. There are also restaurants around and selections of food outlets at basement levels.

Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Good price for certain items depending on what is the Theme such as Food Fiesta, Toys, Luggage, etc. The exhibition changes every month. Good place for family activities like shopping, dinning..."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"It's big, its accessible, its part of Singapore international fashion location. Bags, shoes, bling, and home appliances. The gem here is Kinokunia books. The last good book shop in Singapore. Can it last or will Amazon consume it."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Nice department store. I and my family came here to go shopping... It is not crowded, not too many people here... But in the food court it is very very crowded. We wanted to have lunch at 11 a.m... The food court (located 2 floors down from ground floor) is spacious, but at that time it is already very crowded. Too many people, so it is quite difficult to find the seats."
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Over crowded, may be its due to weekend"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Has many things to buy from
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Best book store in Asia in my travels of thirty years here.
Extensive to say the least.
Helpful staff always knowledgable helpful and patient"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Products/brands bring in by the department store are well curated for both traveller and local customers. Good spot for shopping, especially when they have promotion :)"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Top notch Japanese department store. Good food options in the basement. Visit Kinokuniya bookshop on the top floor of the adjacent building.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Really nice place to shop for items like clothes and bags on the more high end side but there are also a lot of affordable ones. Kinokuniya is there which makes it better
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Sale assistants are very help. High spirit after long shutdown due to covid.

Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Good mix of private labels and renowned brands as also kitchen and home needs, plus an all types of food restaurants and kiosks. Vegetarian food did not seem available. Popular shopping center"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Takashimaya Department Store is a very long time anchor tenant of Ngee Ann City. Hailing from Japan, the department store stocks a large number of Japanese as well as local and international goods. Like most department stores in Singapore, the prices of most goods are quite high compared to if you buy them from other shops. Of particular interest is the basement where you can find some nice Japanese food."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Good shops there
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Less crowded now
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Herro I am from Japan
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Luxurious brand hunter would know this place. Especially promotion period.

Takashimaya Singapore,5,This is my favorite place each time I'm back for vacation. You get everything under one roof. Excellent service! Level 4 has many kids clothing and toys. Definitely a must go for parents with a nursing corner and comfortable changing stations. For the tired mama level 2 has a great choice of designers boutique to pamper oneself. Those who need help with gst refund just go to their customer service counter at level 3 next to the luggage department. For a taste of local check out basement 2 (B2). Happy shopping!
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Unless you have a lot of spare change lying around, the only floor most people would find interesting would be the subterranean floors, which has the supermarket and mass appeal goods. But that's just me."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Best place to have Durian in Cold Storage Dept Store B2, and can eat at the food court.

So an air-cond room and eating durian, a rare combination.

The best place to shopping for kids toys, and clothes  a lot of promotions item, sometimes cheaper than another place in Singapore

There is a lot of pop up promotional exhibition in the Takashimaya Square B2 and Takashimaya Hall B1, next to the cutlery stationery items.

A good place to buy a gift as the collection of an item is an abundance.

If you are a foreigner there is GST refund counter at 3rd level."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,You just have to love this takashimaya mall. Located at the heart of orchard road this is a must stop for us everytime we are in Singapore. They have everything from food to clothing to sports. And the household section is arguably among the best available. The kids section is also extensive and also offers designers labels. The lower ground food area which includes the supermarket and food stalls is superb.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Place has anything you can ask for
Takashimaya Singapore,1,Horrible queue management system. Makes no sense. Have to queue to get into an empty area

Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Japanese department store. Quality from the food hall to every floor. While your time away seeing goods not seen at home to everyday items. Food hall is especially fascinating especially at Chinese New Year, Mooncake festival time etc etc. Always on our list to visit when in town."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,I like the store. Wide range of items for shoppers. Located in the center of orchard road. One of the largest department stores at orchard orchard.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"From my point of view is one of the best mall in Singapore. Very completed, shops restaurants, book store.... I strongly recommend this place."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Remains the departmental store of choice in Singapore... it's high standards has been maintained whilst every of its competitors has morphed into sad versions of their original selves.

Hope Taka will carry on thru the years to come."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,High end place for shopping. Of course you can find a lot of good stuffs here. You pay what you get.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Could I just say the customer service at Takashimaya is JUST TOP-notch!

Takashimaya Singapore,5,Takashimaya Mall is also very good option to purchase branded items. Ralph Lauren at 1st floor is my favourite destination at this mall. 1st floor has jewellery and cosmatics. Floors up has bag and clothing. Top section is best choice for kids. Basement have kitchen accessories and some toiletries. Bedsheets and other similar requisites can alos be found here. Overall a good place to shop.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Very good and friendly service staff. Fast and effecient! No complains at all.
Takashimaya Singapore,5,My husband and I were served by a very attentive and polite sales personnel at the Tie Dept. His name is William Chan.
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"A few years ago I would have said this is one of the premier department stores in SG. Things have changed. It is still very good,  offering a huge variety of items from fashionwear to faux to real jewelry sparkles, plus kitchenware and much more. What has changed is that the employees seem more interested in avoiding helping customers than in actively assisting. I say this after multiple visits over multiple years. If they can just refresh the customer experience through helpful staff members I would give them five stars.
That said, if you do ask for help they will provide, so that is nice.
And one silly thing, I love their shopping bags. I cut out and reuse the floral design on craft projects. Yes. It is that lovely.
Anyway, a good store with clothing, shoes, bags, pearls, some luggage items, menswear, etc. etc. Nice!"
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Upscale mall. We love it when they have events on basement where you can get things at a bargain price. Nice mall
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Nice to shop around..

Takashimaya Singapore,5,Impressive retail concept and you should get all your needs here
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Met a terrific sales staff in takashiyama today. *Mr P Abdul Rahman* in the man's shoe. If u are looking for shoes, i highly recommend u to approach him. He is patient, competent, couteous and professional in his approach  He goes the extra mile by explaining to you the finer details of different type of shoes so that u can make a better decision. I am happy to get what i wanted, at a great discount too.

Its hard to find good sales people these days. I hope that Takashiyama management will lift up Rahman as a good role model for other sales staff to emulate what good customer service really is. Take good care of Rahman. If not, i am sure many others will. Cheers!"
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"Love shopping for delicatessen there but PLEASE get rid of the payment chits that i have to take over to a cashier, pay, and walk back to the product to pick up. This is so outdated in today's world of digital payment technology."

Takashimaya Singapore,5,Upscale departmental store that holds a lot of very good quality brands. Definitely worth a shopping visit if you're looking for something good. I personally prefer Takashimaya to Tangs for its departmental store shopping experience. Helps that Taka offers lifetime shopping vouchers that has no expiry dates - makes their vouchers very appealing gifts for all occasions.

Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Shopping for the brands above ground, while the high street brands are below ground level. Food is quite nice in the food court though."

Takashimaya Singapore,5,A complete shopping mall with very high end products and for the regular shoppers too the variety is endless
Takashimaya Singapore,4,Huge department stalls with lots of shops. Mooncakes here are on 1 for 1 offer but it ends today. There's some Japanese fair on next week in B2
Takashimaya Singapore,3,"I visited Ramen Revolution at the atrium where different types/region ramens were offered up at the different stalls. These are priced $12 on the average. Pricey considering they're served over the counter. I tried the Tantanmen dry noodle from 175°Deno Ramen. It came with minced meat n spring onion. This was purportedly rated top ramen in Toyko this year. At $15 per plate, it was a let down. The beanpaste was too overpowering. It tasted like peanut butter was added to the motley of taste.

I enjoyed the mochi desserts from Maruamami best. I bought the chocolate and  purple sweet potato mochi. 3 for $10...for its size, I find it a little too costly.

Despite being a week day, one  of the ramen stalls had a long line. Then other stalls weren't too happening for some reason."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"The top department store in Singapore. Amazing baby room, great selection covers all aspects you can and can't even think of. It keeps me coming back time and time again."

Takashimaya Singapore,4,Very good Japanese department store with pretty much everything you need from electronics to clothing to homeware and food. Tends to be very busy in the evenings and weekends. Great food court down in the basement.
Takashimaya Singapore,1,"Bad shopping experience with terrible customer service. I purchased a ring from Canary and found it broken in 2 days, a manager from Takashimaya Ms Ong ask me to prove the defect by myself. The way they treat customer is rude and perfunctory, counter manager was missing, the person in charge make me stand at counter for 1 hour plus and she was gone about 20mins between the conversation. Only give one selection which is weld back the ring, no other selection for customer. It means if you purchase a defect item at Takashimaya, you have to accept it bcz you are bad luck. Please remember why ppl chose Takashimaya instead of pasar malam. We hope you can solve it in professional way."
Takashimaya Singapore,5,"Ngee Ann City will be another mall without Takashimaya, a place for young/adults/elderly. a MUST shop place w japan event, japanese food & more!! Patronise since school days!"
Takashimaya Singapore,5,Love all the mooncake stall. Bought too much this season
Takashimaya Singapore,4,"Personally i love to shop in takashimaya. Especially the babyroom.

They spoke in mandarin. I ended up paying full instead."

For those interested in the book, go to Kinokuniya Bookstore located at level 4. And this mall also provides free WIFI for its visitors. If you feel hungry you can also enjoy good food at reasonable prices at the food court located in Basement 2. I have a great experience shopping at this place. This is the place you should visit If you are coming to Orchard Road."

The aunties at appliance and household knows what ot takes to run a home. Gangs used to have them...but no longer. The sports section is what Isetan Scott's used to be...but no longer. The forecourt (paradise) is what Yaohan (long gone) used to be...but no longer .

There is a lesson here for STPB. It is people behind the counters that attract shoppers - not light ups and car free sundays.

Yeah. Taka is Taka."

Not forgetting that Bugis Junction is the interchange between the Downtown and East West lines, making it easy for me to make my way to the city from my relatives’ place in Bukit Panjang (where I usually stay when in SG)… With a myriad of food outlets in the LG floor which is also the concourse to the MRT station…"

Well known key anchor stores like BHG flagship store, challenger, times books and well known brand store for shoes, bags and apparels can be found here. It’s connected to the Bugis+ mall on the opposite side of the road so plenty of shopping, food and even a movie theatre to spend time in here. Not to forget the famous Bugis Arcade right opposite across the road is famous for its cheap, chick and trendy items giving you feel of street shopping or Bangkok style shopping experience. All in all good place to shop and spend time. Have been coming here regularly over past many years and always like the place."
Bugis Junction,5,"Amazing place. Futuristic, with word i don't want to ruin beautiful of it. Go and visit"

It's also next to Bugis market, very accessible via MRT, but also easily walkable distance from Raffles place, chime's, national library....."
Bugis Junction,5,"I was at Bugis+ and Bugis Junction this afternoon on Friday 19 June 2021, not crowded surprisingly and a very comfortable experience to shop, thanks to ""Covid 19"" I guess 😊. Anyway, the virus is everywhere in Singapore and there's no way to hide now 🤦‍♂️. Life marches on and Majulah Singapura💪!"
Bugis Junction,5,Good place to shop for youngsters. Good selection of eateries. A little bit of something for everyone.
Bugis Junction,3,Busy hectic place .   With practically every thing u need under the one roof.  Including a pot plant vending machine! @fishtaleswithtim

Bugis Junction,5,"Went to WagyuMore for lunch at Bugis.
Bugis now has tighten security. The MRT entrance/exit via the basement is now only for entrance. Exiting has to be done via level 1 and then escalator down to mrt again. Shops are still open and still can be crowded most times. Very well equipped mall for all the family"
Bugis Junction,5,I had the best fried chicken in Singapore
Bugis Junction,4,"This mall is a busy shopping mall with lots and lots of visitors. The basement is pretty decent with many places to eat. On the other floors you can buy lots of inexpensive souvenirs, accessories and clothes and it is interesting wandering around as there is just so much to see and lots of eat places. There are also many fast food restaurants here. Bugis Street is just across the road and even though you can find cheaper items here it is still nicer to shop in Bugis Junction in my opinion. Other nearby places that are walking distance from here are Arab Street, Sim Lim Square, the OG department store and Little India. Bugis Junction and Bugis Street are fun but not really my cup of tea as far as shopping goes, but great if you are looking for bargains. The location is conveniently located just next to Bugis MRT."
Bugis Junction,5,Crowded as usual. But good place to shop
Bugis Junction,5,It's a great selection of fun & food! we really enjoyed eating there and shopping for all these little knick-knacks for the family.
Bugis Junction,5,"Since no dine in is allowed there's still crowd but it's like Ez link type....Tap and Go...
Fun family outing went to my fav Under Armour to get The Rock sleeveless top oh yeeeeeeaaaaah"
Bugis Junction,3,"Quiet given Pandemic restrictions which is a good thing I guess.  Food in Basement offering decent variety from local kopi chain YaKun and Old Chang Kee, to more typically Cantonese fare from Crystal Jade and Joy Luck Treasure... can try their HaeBeeHiam Floss on Chee Cheong Fan which wasn't bad at all given the novelty.   Pharmacist at Guardian was nice and polite and Cashier even apologized for keeping me waiting tho it was hardly even a min.  Rest of the shops looked like they were struggling and hoping for customers.  Can also access Bugis+ on 2nd flr with connecting bridge so avoid sun and rain."
Bugis Junction,5,One of the busy malls in Singapore that are frequented by families during the weekends because of the popular Buddhist temple.
Bugis Junction,5,Nice place. A bit crowded still in these covid times
Bugis Junction,5,One of my favourite shopping mall in singapore
Bugis Junction,5,Best place for enjoy and shopping
Bugis Junction,5,One of the more frequented malls. Various food options with alot of choices around the surrounding roads. Always spoilt for options here
Bugis Junction,4,"Great shopping centre, good food upstairs and all not too big."
Bugis Junction,5,"Bugis, Bugis+ and bugis junction - a splendid triad of locations to visit with many lovely levels of compact shopping and the nearby Bugis Village. People could choose to stay at the nearby bencoolen street , Selgie Road Albert Court hotel or the Little India stretch for some South Indian delicacies - but Bugis gives the feeling of old historic structures
And the new , cutting age modern mall feel across vastness and yet compact spaces to shop with all major brands - do visit Uniclo and BHG store as well as the longish Watson’s store - my kids childhood memories around the “spurty fountain” got us all wet so many times in the 2000’s. Bugis glass roof is top class and leaves memories even after 10 years of me relocating out of Singapore"
Bugis Junction,5,Very good one!
Bugis Junction,4,It has a good spread of shops but the corridors for walking are not wide enough. Walking through the basement with all the food stores can be quite a nightmare as it gets very crowded and squeezy. I like how the mall connects to Bugis+ on the second floor and it is very convenient.
Bugis Junction,4,You never walk alone…that is the only reason that i came here but its true that their service has been that…if its a non liverpool fans of course u will get unnecessarily comments…typical but lets be neutral …their service needs improvement…
Bugis Junction,4,"Great mix of shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Can buy just about anything here and spend a whole day walking around."
Bugis Junction,5,"Large number of stores and insane selection of relatively cheap restaurants. Also in a very convenient location, with the Bugis MRT and bus station in the same building."
Bugis Junction,2,Interested plot visit...
Bugis Junction,5,great location for underground MRT and shopping. Its food court is a nice place for quite bites.
Bugis Junction,4,"Messy shopping mall that is aging decently well. For its size, it should have more directories to facilitate flow and the searching of its tenant stores. There’s a good range of mid priced restaurants and stores, enough to fill a long day of shopping.

Despite COVID-19, the place is very crowded though. Go at your own risk."
Bugis Junction,4,Nice air condition 7 level of shopping mall. Whirlwind parking. Polite & courteous i counter staff.
Bugis Junction,5,I love to shop at Bugis. Many different types of food and items to choose to eat and buy.
Bugis Junction,5,Great hangout for youngsters and tourists who are looking to explore the glass ceiling vibe of a pasar (market) instead with air conditioning. A blending of the old and the new. Also connected to intercontinental
Bugis Junction,3,A nice shopping mall but the food court seems like dying with not many choice of food stalls available...
Bugis Junction,5,"I always like to go here to buy either souvenirs (to bring back home) or to dine in in one of the halal restaurants. There's also another market behind bugis junction (with many white tents). If you like durians, there  a stall sell musang king (yummy).
Another spots to buy souvenir or chocolate is mustafa center, china town and ABC shop (behind bugis junction)."

Bugis Junction,5,This place was recommended by a friend so I had dinner there with them. I had the fried chicken with salted egg and it was really good. Huge serving as well. Very filling.

Bugis Junction,4,"Maybe this place is so sentimental to me cos when my son was a toddler, he used to run into this fountain and had had so much fun.
Bugis is a junction of the old and new, there is a market across the street from BHG dept store (rochor Road) Where u can buy 10$ clothing with designs aplenty.
On the side side across the North bridge road, are rows and rows of restaurants in shop houses.
A place worth visiting if u are a tourist, this place has its own uniqueness."
Bugis Junction,4,"A decent shopping mall, do not confuse it with bugis plus which is a different building. The two buildings are connected by a sky bridge at the 2nd storey."
Bugis Junction,4,"Very big mall meant for shopping, with many retail outlets but very confusing to traverse."
Bugis Junction,5,It does have a junction. Lots of good food and desserts.
Bugis Junction,5,All under one roof kinda mall. Linked to a 5 star hotel and the MRT Station. Across the road from the national library etc.
Bugis Junction,4,Bugis Junction is neither here nor there but because they have Kinokuniya I gave them extra points
Bugis Junction,5,Love this place choice of good & shopping is great
Bugis Junction,3,"Not bad, just an average shopping mall but way too crowded compared to vivocity. Not many variety of eateries here tbh and quite expensive including mcd. Just beside the mall across the road you can enjoy some affordable meals like chinese/mamak. Love their mala steamboat. Shopping mall with many cosmetics and gadgets. Not worth the time to visit if you came for sightseeing."
Bugis Junction,5,"There is something about bugis junction. Although it's a mall, the inside give you an European feel - well atleast for me. It's a different take on malls. Nice place to hangout. It has a connecting bridge to bugis+ which is another mall."

Bugis Junction,5,Huge and spacious mall
Bugis Junction,5,Not too crowded
Bugis Junction,4,"Lots of great shops for everyone, a mall that caters to the common person. A beautiful space developed in the 90s which retained a part of old shoplots of bugis street and structure around it a glass encasement so it could be redeveloped into an indoor mall that's air conditioned. If you think glass encased malls like Jewel are a new thing, this is probably where it started in Singapore. Innovation has been part of Singapore since the early days."
Bugis Junction,5,"Great Shopping Centre, blending conservation shop houses of the past and two modern towers of the present. Two MRT Lines serve this mall:  East West Line and Downtown Line. There are high class restaurants in the Intercontinental Hotel, medium price restaurants in the mall and food courts serving every day Singapore street food.  I recommend this place."

Bugis Junction,1,"Don't park at B1.  This mall has terrible parking management during this COVID season. Unknowingly, we parked at B1 upon entry. Despite being at the intercontinental hotel basement entrance,  we were directed to another corner of the carpark to exit by a staircase. More nightmare awaited our re-entry :(  After our shopping, we went back to the same exit only to realise that it is a one way door i.e. we can't get back in.  There were also no signs telling us how to get back to the basement car park.  We had to walk round the mall to enter the mall again and check with the counter staff inside the mall.  But the Capitaland Mall staff were none the wiser.  We were directed on a merry go around by 3 diff staff telling us to try 3 diff routes and none was successful!?!?!?  We finally managed to get to B2 level car park and was told to walk up the car ramp to get to B1.  It was a treacherous journey for us because we were literally walking alongside cars which are zooming up and down the narrow ramp to get between B1 and B2.  Surely there must be a safer way for your customers than this, right??  The lack of signage and untrained staff were most frustrating.  I will not visit Bugis Junction again during this COVID season!!"

Bugis Junction,3,Big Cold Storage supermarket and a BHG department store.  Many small clothing and shoes stores with cafes and a food court in the basement.  Malls are narrow and can feel very crowded and claustrophobic and hot.  It does have a MRT station in sub basement with an interchange of 2 lines that does make the place very busy. If it wasn't for this not sure the mall would be as busy as there are certainly bigger malls with better shops in Raffles City and Orchard road.
Bugis Junction,5,Food Junction on level 3 of Bugis Junction is a terrific and inexpensive place to enjoy a very wide variety of great Singapore local foods. That's where the locals eat. Wonderful.

A lot many shops selling varying items, from dresses, shoes, bags to lovely souvenirs, you'll find everything real cheap. Although different shops have different prices for the same item, I'd advice you to have a full walk around (or check atleast 4 or 5 shops)  with some bargaining skills before you purchase.
There are shopping malls if you are tired of walking under the hot sun. But beware, the pricing can be bit different (high) from that of the outside.And the best part is, the MRT is just across the road."

I like the idea of separating the food places and shopping places.

Bugis Junction,4,Do not usually visit this centre except for specific purpose such as looking for computer / laptop or fixing eye glasses or contact lens.

The development also compromised 3 blocks of preserved pre-war shophouses incorporated into the mall's development. Upon completion, it was the first glass covered shopping mall in Singapore linking the 3 streets - Bugis Street, Malay Street and Hylam Street.
Linked to Bugis MRT Station at Basement 1, Bugis Junction was one of the popular malls in Singapore back then. It featured a department store, a cinema, a food court, a video games arcade and more than 200 specialty shops. In 2005, the mall was sold to Capitaland."
