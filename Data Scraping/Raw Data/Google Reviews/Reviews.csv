"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"One word!Such an amazing place to stroll at day time and especially at night!

Come and visit and buy stuff here for your Chinese New Year ornaments and home decors. Enjoy the street food here as well!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,It is a place where experiences from my 4 months in Asia were sinking in. It shows traditional lives as they were and as they still are in Chinese live-in eateries in Vientiane or on the bustling streets of Chinatown in Bangkok. Personal stories and family stories make one think about the lives of immigrants of old and new times. They also make you think about your own life story. The whole place is also a subtle homage to Chinese culture. Beautiful for anyone who has ever visited and admired China.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Best place for food n shopping
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This museum is surely interesting for everyone. You can follow the first Chinese immigrants how they moved from China , where they arrived , the conditions in which they had to live and the difficulties had to face. They all had to work extremely  hard  (sometimes as slaves) in order to survive and build up a future for their families. Really admirable what they did."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre in Singapore is a fantastic interactive museum, one of the most detailed, comprehensive and accessible museums I've been to. Definitely worth the entry fee, this centre is engaging with rooms dedicated to following the life of a family and tenants who lived in the shop there in the 1950s. This personalisation of history was highly engaging, as were the still life exhibits. If anything, there's so much detail and information that by the end of it you may leave feeling overwhelmed. You could easily spend two hours or more here, and it's worth visiting just to get out of the Singaporean humidity. The audio guide was very informative, otherwise wander at your own pace. I'd recommend to anyone wanting to learn a little bit about life in post-war Singapore. In summary, this tour was unexpected in its quality in the best of ways and I would recommend it to any of my friends heading to Singapore."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Corloful place with beautiful community. I'm very lucky when it stopped raining when we came. Enjoy a lot.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Brought students here for learning journey and was pleasantly surprised by the renovated museum.

I am particularly impressed by the display of sleeping quarters of people working different jobs in the early days. Much effort has been devoted to replicate the living environment of our forefathers who earned a hard living doing various odd jobs.

The admission ticket is not cheap but it is not going to be a disappointment. I think it is worth a visit."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"A history of Singapore.  Great place to visit.  Has a very real an interesting insight into the development of Singapore.  Can’t vouch for accuracy, but it’s a cultural staple of the city state."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Good area for Chinese food. Any restaurants that claim to be street food with a trip adviser sign stay clear of as its very overpriced mediocre slosh. Eat where you see the locals eat. Plus we found shopping malls have really good food at around 2-3 US dollars for a meal👌
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Very intersting loved the whole experience. Head sets easy to use. 2hrs well spent.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Another air-conditioned haven from Singapore heat. This center takes you though history of Chinatown with a mockup of a shop-house from days gone by. It was quiet freaky to the space that a family of eight would live in, which by modern standards would be about the size of the average bathroom. There is an audio guide supplied with your entrance ticket but I found it to be too long, the commentary for each stop were at least 4-8 minutes long and over 30 stops in the display."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Cheap to visit at $18. Audio headsets in multiple languages. Great insight into early beginnings of Singapore.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Such a wonderful place to visit that it shows the old Chinese culture and the way of living at that time. Many things to see and learn from the history.

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,It's a great place to walk and learn the Chinese culture
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This place takes some time to adjust to, but it has a unique and interesting way to convey life in the China Town neighborhood back in the days. A lot of thought and detail have been put to this place and a lot of information is available.

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Loved the museum. Got to learn a lot about Chinese settlements in Singapore and their lives
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Far more expensive than the other heritage centres, but worth the price. The exhibition is in 3 parts: life in a shop house, the history of Chinese immigration to Singapore, and the transformation to modern times. Included in the ticket price is the audio guide, which is information and engaging. The ticket also includes a free curry puff or egg tart, so don't forget to keep the paper ticket."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This place was absolutely amazing. The multimedia used was not without flaws but, man, you would really know that a lot of thought and work were put behind creating an audiovisual and tactile experience  that would allow the visitor to be pulled in and to walk through what life must have been like for immigrants in early Chinatown and to understand how hard it had truly been. By the end of the tour, that fee you'd paid at the entrance? You'd know it was worth it."

You get to have a glimpse of living in a shophouse like in the 40s-60s, which is an insightful experience. Worth mentioning also are the brochures - informative and creatively made. Thumbs up!

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Love to visit there and enjoy food and shopping
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"I wish there were 6 stars!  This was without question the best of Chinatown.  The staff were incomparable, in particular a lovely lovely lady named Celeste.  She explained how the interactive tour worked, took my very heavy bag of just purchased Saris from the Sri Mariamman Temple and stored them for me so that I could enjoy the centre without discomfort.  I had to remind myself constantly that this exhibit was set in the mid twentieth century.  In my life time! I was humbled, educated and I came away with a better understanding and appreciation of this tiny country.  Visitors go to Chinatown for various reasons, I encourage all visitors to enjoy the shopping, taste the food, but take the time to truly embrace the history of the area.  Thank you so much to all of you who have curated a fabulous exhibition.  I particularly loved the ""Threads of Continuity"".  Celeste and another worker there organised for us to have a Trishaw ride to Clarke Quays, followed by a bum boat ride on the river .. WOW !!  Do it.  It is an amazing experience!  Loved loved loved it!  Thank you so very much.

Jenny and Chris Eales, Adelaide. Australia 16 August 2017"

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Informative and extremely well laid out gallery. Some stories are very sad. Great way to understand the history of the area. Some exhibitions were a bit dusty - not sure if it's meant to evoke the atmosphere or if just a bit unkempt. Great exhibition, thank you."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"I would like to strongly recommend to visit this place. It's interactive and well prepared exhibition. In very easy way, it helps you to understand daily lift of first habitants of Singapore, development of the city and district. Audio guide is included into price of ticket together with delicious traditional snack which you can get in front of center."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Good place to relax
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Taste is good
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Very informative. Allow a good couple of hours to get through all the information. Kids enjoyed seeing the contrast between past and present living conditions.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"A great tour… they’ll provide you with headphones for audio commentary. Can be a nice place to check out while you’re in Chinatown and you want a bit of history. Unfortunately for me, I had a pain in my neck and shoulders, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t linger any longer nor check out all what they had to exhibit which was a huge deal."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Nice place to know alittle bit more on Chinatown Singapore
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Nice place!

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Very informative with very good coverage.
An audio guide was provided with pictures - incase you don’t know which object they’re referring to. However, it’d be great if they could give and option to speed up the speaking pace.

The center has expanded since I last visited, and they’ve done a really good job.

Definitely a must-see for all to understand Chinatown’s history better.

*Ticket holders are also in for a curry puff/egg tart treat!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Great place for street food and souvenir shopping. Bring tissues to use in bathrooms and as napkins. Also, I recommend wet wipes ."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Apart from the typically high tourist oriented  entrance fee (no different to any other tourist destination in Singapore) an excellent museum  with in your face displays highlighting b the v story of Chinese immigration to Singapore. If you take the personal guides it takes hours of fascinating detail
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"If you want to know more about the history of Chinatown in the colonial days, then this is the place to go! You can go for the tour on your own as it is pretty much self run using the mobile app which they are using. It tells the history of a tailor Mr Chan, and how he lets out his rooms to other tenants and you can also understand the lives of the tenants then. Eg. The old bucket system for toilets, the prep hole at the second floor and the old pillows used in the past are some of the items worth taking a look!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Great place for see stunning collection of goods in Singapore. This is a place you must visit when you travel to Singapore. So many food stalls and Hawker Centers around this centre. Next time we will visit this place, 'cos this time we have small time to spent this lovely Museum."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Singapore iconic marketplace
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",1,Visited China heritage centre but I haven't had good experience. Waited to get attention of guide who was telling about Chinese history but he was so busy in other two white people that he just ignored me like i was not there.will never visit. Very bad experience. Got escape from there after waiting 15min.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Good place for buy Singapore souvenir
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Hot.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This is an amazing museum for anyone interested in Singapore’s history. You can tell a lot of care went into the exhibits, especially the reproductions of Chinese immigrants living quarters. The audio guide is also super thorough and interesting—the Heritage Centre is a gem amongst the tourist-centered shops in Chinatown"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Good foood
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Great place to spend for shopping and food. Two hours will already be enough. I have not tried haggling but I don't think you still need to do it. The prices are reasonable. Aside from that you could also enjoy the view around the area. There are temples, open area for live events. It's definitely one area you should not miss when you visit Singapore."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"To be frank, we did not even know the Chinatown Heritage Centre exists in the midst of the busy Chinatown... until we were attracted by the Samsui Women monuments in front of it! Loved the various cultural exhibits on show and they really brought back lots of memories. There is a paid tour which unfortunately we did not have the time for. We will definitely be back with the children after this."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Buy your souvenirs in Chinatown
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Great place to visit if you want to know more about Chinatown and how it evolved to the state that it is in. Visited on a Sat morning and went on a Mandarin guided tour with Clinton as our guide. This guy is good in his job! He is very engaging and doesn't make the tour feel boring. He added in his own sense of humor to the whole tour, which we appreciated!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Much Enjoyable
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Great place to be!!!
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,This is a great museum - thoughtfully curated with lots of detail and interesting background information. Each floor of the house is laid out the way it would have been in the early 20th century and provides you with insight into the lives being led there. The audio guide adds extra colour.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"If you want to immerse yourself in the life and history of Singapore back in the day, this is a great place to start. The audio tour is immersive and extensive - but can be too wordy if you're only looking for a quick tour. You can skip some of the audio parts and still get a lot of info and be done in roughly 1 hour, or take the time to go through it all and run for 2 to 2.5 hours. It is set in an old shophouse so you must be able to go up and down flights of stairs, though there is a small elevator for those who need it. Tour ends with your choice of a sweet and savoury snack."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Nice and friendly staff. They showcase plenty of ancient Chinese relics. If you need pictures of heritage. Ticket is a little pricey. It cost $18 for one adult ticket on a weekday without a guided tour.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Crowded Chinatown... The food street have lots of plentiful choices. But if you want cheaper price foods might as well get to the nearest hawker center.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Excellent guided tour. One of the most impressive and engaging museums we have ever seen. Try to catch the guided tour, well worth it."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Good food
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Think Chinese! Think Chinatown
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Definitely a great visit not only for tourist but for locals. Brought my relatives from Canada and it was a great time of sharing for my uncle who had lived through those times and my cousin who had never lived in Asia.
Very well set up. Staff a little too serious though.
Still.. highly recommended!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"The Chinatown Heritage centre is an amazing step back in Singapore's history. The building provides an insight into the various lives lived in the shophouses, as well as a glimpse into the development of Singapore over the last seventy years.

More impressively, the site allows for greater immersion via all of the senses. I highly recommend this to tourists and those interested in Singapore's history."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,This is a great place to learn about the history of the area. The tour is a go at your own pace tour. It could be quite long but if you skip around a bit you can make it as short or long as you like. It was really interesting. So glad we went.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"It's the best place to learn more about Chinese lives in Singapore. Once you step inside, you will feel like you are travelling back to the old days. Great presentation!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Lot of shopping outlets and eateries around.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Lots of China shops with apparel n accessories. But the products slightly varies across these shops, though there are few stores with unique accessories. There is one for street of eateries serving completely non veg dishes with sea food etc. It's colorfully decorated street though."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"An excellent presentation of the way people lived in Singapore and the creation of Chinatown. The audio commentaries bringing it all to life. The exact examples showing the cramped and awful conditions were very well exhibited, most informative. I would highly recommend a visit but give yourself a good hour plus to see everything."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Amazing place busy like what we have in Mumbai. I was at right time because next week is chinese new year and all streets are beautifully decorated
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",1,Extremely bad service by the counter staff. Was serviced by a taller lady with a pony tail on the 19 Dec 2019. There's a very arrogant feel to the staff. Don't recommend visiting the heritage center since the staff are so badly trained. Change the frontline lady staff please. No smile at all. Very unfriendly.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Really good museum with focus of life in the 1950s in Chinatown. Even though the museum is small its packed with many items to see. Its main focus is on the types of people there rather than how they came to be there or how the overcrowding occurred which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Its a fascinating look into how things were in Singapore back in the day. Well worth a look of you are in Chinatown
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Beautiful place lovely people and a lot of street shopping and food
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Bes place to go in China town
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,This museum was incredible! The audio tour which comes with the standard ticket is so informative and told like a story. I learned so much about the history and development of Chinese people in Singapore and where things are going today. I left knowing so many secret histories of the past. Highly recommend!
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Such a wonderful museum! It really gave me a thorough overview of the life back in the days in Chinatown. They use very advanced technologies and well thought through installations to tell the story. Definitely recommend!
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Second time I've visited over the years. This museum is very impressive and teaches me a lot about the Singapore of yesteryear that my mum grew up in. Audio tour is comprehensive, well voiced, and perfectly paced and there is a ton of stuff to see. I estimate it takes 2-3 hours to read every placard at every exhibit. Gift shop didn't have anything special. Well worth the time and price."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Absolutely stunning exhibition. With the audio guide makes you believe you have travelled back in time. Takes a long time to go through but it is well worths it. Also gives a lot of hints what else to do in town.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Still nice to visit. Many tourists. Upgrading of stalls but most of the usual staff still there. More eating houses.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,I really liked this place. It might look a bit built up with all the stories it tells but it really shows in a great way the life of the old Chinatown. Comparing to the Indian one I believe this is much more interesting.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,Bit touristy but good shopping & good spot for a stop & a cold beer!
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"one of the busy streets where you can see the singapore.. Displays souvenirs and many more.. It might make you feel like you are really in some part of 'china' .. the street shops, street food.."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Nice Chinese food.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Very good place to find some Singaporean souvenirs with cheap price. Start from 1 sing dollar to max 10 sing dollar max. Some merchants allows you to bargain. If you are quite sensitive with the sun heats, always use the sun-screen, bring umbrella or hat and some water, because at noon the temperature could raise till 40 celcius."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Good shops with different price. Pay attention to underground area as they have some of the best shop and foood there. The night market food court is delicious.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Mascara warning, if you've any sensitivity then seeing how hard life was not too long ago for some people should tug at your heart strings.

It is very informative and interesting with the help of the audio guide, not something that i would ordinarily partake in. The reproduction seems to be very good.

Stand in the doorway of the room of the family of 2 adults and 6 kids and think about it..."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,The temple is very nice from inside. Very calm and peaceful. You can borrow cloth from the temple to cover yourself if you are planning to wear shorts or sleeveless clothes.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Clean and usualy place
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,👍🏻
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,The Chinatown heritage centre traces the history of Singapore's early pioneers who left mainland China in search of a better future for their families. A must visit for those who love history and want to know more of what makes this small country tick.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,It is a good exhibition showing how the early Chinese immigrants from China settled themselves down in Chinatown.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,Chinatown Singapore is a vibrant place to visit during the Chinese New Year. Full of colour & noise! Easily accessible via the MRT system.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"The architechture is rich with heritage, belonging to serveral cultures. The unique blend of Chinese, Malay and Indian architechture truely reflects how ubiquitous multiculturalism is in Singapore."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Wow, what an amazing museum! I cannot praise this place enough! It is such a gem. The exhibition is extremely well curated and the antiques very well protected. The staff members are extremely friendly. You need a good hour for the first two floors, and you need another 30-45 minutes for the last floor."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"A short walk from our hotel, the 1887. Re-live the lives of Chinese immigrants as it happened in the early part of the century. See the stories of various trades people, from tailors to carpenters to family life."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Lovely place. Missed visiting Buddha temple. You can shop with good bargain as late in night. Try lebonis and turkish dishes in hawkers spot. in 15 dollars your tummy bursts out. Be a good foodie.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Really worth doing had great audio too
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Really gives you a good feel for life in Chinatown - particularly the hidden parts
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Nicely done.  A little pricey at 15 entrance...i think 10 would be more realistic. Exhibits nice presented  and audio guide is excellent if a little slow paced...taking a good hour to complete. I would suggest  mannequins  to give it a more crowded feel and less aircon but these are minor issues in a pleasant and informative experience
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Don't miss it if you are interested in history, incl. 1950s and 1960s, back into the old days of Singapore. (Positively worth the admission fee of 15 SGD. Well done presentation and audio guide)."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Great place to uncover Chinatown and its rich history.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Very busy as usual but love the history behind this place. Lot of things to buy for tourists. Food wise is okay choice.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Really good but the experience was much much longer than we thought, and we ended up skipping  out of most of the later parts. The first section walks you through the living spaces and is actually less than half of the whole thing, so be prepared!"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Great museum! Inside the shop house, a very well curated museum that recreates the living conditions of people living in these shop houses in olden day Singapore. From the samsui women to a family of hawkers, the virtual tour will bring you around the house and give you a glimpse into the everyday lives and conversations of the people that used to live here. On the 3rd floor is a more sobering exhibit, that documents many of the struggles that the early immigrants had to go through when coming over to Singapore to seek out a better future. All in all though, a great place for learning and entry is around 15 sgd."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"$15 entrance, but it's worth it. It is a very well done history museum. Lots of great information and the interactive guide is very well done. Definitely worth a visit."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Great little museum of life in Chinatown during the earlier times
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"A nice museum to learn about overseas Chinese heritage, with detail explanation of how overseas Chinese used to live, what inside of Chinese house from the past, etc. I really the way they use audio tour guide which we can play it in every room for the explanation. However, this museum is quite small. So, everything inside is quite packed."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,So much about Singapore early settlers in here. It is a must see. How the immigrants lived and worked was a real eye opener. Give yourself plenty of time for this.
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,A very interesting museum! The first part of the exhibition is a wonderful recreation of the life inside a shop house. You will learn a lot about the different groups of immigrants who came to Singapore but also what was life here just a few decades back. Do not miss it!
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,A great window to the past of Singapore. Very well presented and.good.value for money

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"It was an amazing experience! Total immersion into Chinatown of 1950s - 1960s. The exhibition takes 3 floors and covers all aspects of local people's lives. The entrance fee seemed pricey at first but after visiting the exhibition we felt that it was totally worth it. You'll also get a small device where you can listen to audio explanations as well as check some extra materials, both audio and visual. Make sure to reserve enough time for your visit! I'd say 2.5 hours for sure."
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Ok, this was not really a planned trip but this experience was great! We were a bit rushed with time so only spend 45 min, but I think we could have stayed for more than 2 hours easily. It was an inmersive experience with tons of great stories that were well explained and fit well to the scenes. The small tablet used as a guide was also easy to navigate. It might feel a bit cramped when too many people visiting, but still highly recommended"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Lots to see and plenty of tourists
Also, no shortage of durian"
"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,many good spot for taking pictures and also you can find souvenirs easily here with cheap price. kinda hard to find halal food.

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,"Average. Good food but lack of seating. If they had enough seats it'd be great! Such a busy little street, Smith St. Lots of food options, with street ""stalls"" in the centre of the street, and restaurants on the side. The stalls sell mostly hawker food. The was a 30 minute wait between ordering and receiving food at the satay stall. Almost impossible to get a table to eat. Had to share, which isn't a problem, but it took a few tries asking people until I actually found someone who'd let me sit with them. Food at most of the stalls is good, and quite well-priced, but some of the staff at the stalls are so unorganised and lack of seating to eat meals is a real problem here. Get off at Chinatown MRT to get here."

"Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"On a visit to SG from Melbourne, I went to the CHC to see how much I could recapture of my early life in SG. I was not disappointed. Far from it: the artefacts brought back many memories of and much nostalgia for my childhood: from the foldable canvas bed, the charcoal iron (to iron clothes with), the striped pyjama pants hanging on the bamboo pole “to dry” to the peephole on the floor of the Chinese physician’s cubicle - all these was a trip down memory lane for me. These were but a few of the many exhibits and scenes of Singapore which resonated with me.
The CHC is a “must see” not only for tourists but also for the people of Singapore who can show their children and grandchildren what life was like to the early migrants to SG.
For the senior citizens of Singapore (as well as other elderly visitors) there’s nothing to worry about the centre being a 3-storey building - it is equipped with an elevator. During my visit, I saw an elderly visitor wipe away a tear as she walked along the passageway viewing the exhibits. What a powerful testimony of their authenticity!"

Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore พิพิธภัณฑ์แสดงเรื่องราวประวัติความเป็นมาขอและการใช้ชีวิตชาวจีนสมัยอดีตที่เริ่มเข้ามาตั้งรกรากในสิงคโปร์ ซึ่งต้องต่อสู้ดิ้นรนในระหว่างที่อพยพเข้ามาโดยการหลีกหนีการถูกดขี่ข่มเหงจากจีนแผ่นดินใหญ่ และ การต่อสู้กับความยากจนในอดีต

ภายในอาคารทั้งสามชั้นจะจัดแสดงหุ่นจำลองเกี่ยวกับเรื่องราววิถีชีวิตของชาวจีน ข้าวของเครื่องใช้ ในยุคที่ย้ายเข้ามาตั้งรกรากในสิงคโปร์ จนได้มาเป็นไชน่าทาวน์อย่างที่เราเห็นในทุกวันนี้

สถานที่ตั้งอยู่ในซอยแหล่งช้อบปิ้งของย่านไชน่าทาวน์เลย (ซอยที่คั่นตรงกลางระหว่างวัดศรีมริอัมมันต์ กับ มัสยิด Jamae (Julia ) Mosque นั่นแหล่ะ ดังนั้นสามารถแวะที่นี่ได้หากจะไปเที่ยวที่วัดทั้งสองนี้ค่ะ

พิพิธภัณฑ์นี้นอกจากด้านในจะน่าถ่ายรูปแล้ว ด้านหน้าก้อน่าถ่ายรูปเช่นกัน อย่างที่เราถ่ายมาให้ชมนี้ จะมีร้านรถเข็นขายรองเท้าโบราณ (ที่ไม่ได้ขายรองเท้า แต่ใช้เป็น display ตั้งโบรชัวร์ของพิพิธภัณฑ์ 😄 ) และ มีรองเท้าเกี๊ยะขนาดยักษ์เป็นเก้าอี้ยาว เก๋ทีเดียว

ส่วนป้าย cutout รูปผู้หญิงผายมือไปที่พื้นเพื่อเตือนให้เราระวังการการก้าวเดิน (เพราะตรงนั้นมันเป็นพื้นต่างระดับน่ะค่ะ ) ที่เราสองคนถ่ายรูป เพราะคุณภามีไอเดียว่า ให้เราทำท่าจับมือกับผู้หญิงคนนี้กันดีกว่า จนมีผู้หญิงจีนสิงคโปร์ใจดีคนหนึ่งมาอาสาช่วยถ่ายรูปให้เรา แต่เราจะถ่ายรูปให้เค้า เค้าไม่เอาค่ะ ชาวเมืองนี้ช่างเป็นคนที่มีน้ำใจจัง ไปตรงไหน ๆ ก้อเจอแต่คนสิงคโปร์ที่มีน้ำใจ และ เป็นมิตรตลอดการท่องเที่ยวทริปนี้เลยค่ะ"

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",5,"Thian Hock Keng Temple (天福宮) is Singapore’s oldest Hokkien temple. Located at 158 Telok Ayer Street, it is recognised as the most majestic Chinese temple in Singapore.

It was designed and built in 1842 by skilled craftsmen from China according to traditional Chinese temple architectural style. The temple is managed by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. It was gazetted as a national monument on 28 June 1973.

In 1907, Emperor Guang Xu (光緒帝) of the Qing Dynasty presented a plaque, together with a silk scroll, to the temple. The wooden plaque is inscribed with the Chinese characters 波靖南溟 (bo jing nan ming), which mean “gentle waves over the South Seas”, The same four Chinese characters are also found on the yellow scroll.

The plaque and scroll had hung over the temple’s main altar signboard until 1999, when they were taken down before restoration work began. A replica of the original scroll and the original wooden plaque were returned to the same spot upon the completion of restoration work. The original scroll was subsequently donated to the National Museum of Singapore.

A new eight-storey Hokkien Huay Kuan Building was built on Telok Ayer Street in 2003, with the clan association occupying the top floor.

On 16 April 2005, a ceremony to commemorate the completion of the temple restoration, the clan association’s 165th anniversary and the opening of the new building was officiated by then Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong."

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",5,"It was a very old temple in China town near Amoy street. I was there to pray at the end of Chinese new year and the second day of Chinese new year. The place was always crowded with local people and tourists. At the opposite site of the road, there was a building, on top of that building, they design it like the image of eyes looking down from the sky. Although it was crowded, everything was so calm inside. On the right side, there was a wishing well. I saw some European throw coins there but it was not the way they should do to make a wish. Long time ago, people used to drink water from the well believing that water was blessed. Right now, they didn't drink water from the well anymore. They just ring the bells, each bell was a symbol of a wish, then put the hands together and wish. The letters on the bells were Chinese so I couldn't read. I dragged my phone out to use Google translate in order to know that they mean. The security guy saw me and thought that I was taking pictures so he came to me and reminded me not to take pictures. I explained what I was doing so he stopped and translated for me although they were about to close. He was so helpful and kind"

The temple is within walkable distance from Telok Ayer MRT station and is surrounded by many nice bars and restaurants. Having walked there, there's no trace that the temple was close to former waterfront or landing point by seafarers from southern China. It feels like the temple is in middle of concrete buildings. Seafarers and early Chinese immigrants in Singapore paid visit to this temple to give thanks for safe trip to Nanyang (South Sea). As a custom, visitors are advised to enter from right door and exit at left door and pay respect to the worshippers. The temple earns its appreciation perhaps due to every single details of the wooden carvings and colourful paints to the wooden carvings. The ornaments remind the travellers of the stone carving in Notredame Church in Paris or other classical European church. The carvings are varied from people riding horses, the crowd of people and etc. These carvings are the ornaments on the wooden structures that were laid on each other without nails, then on the concrete structures. For architecture and building lovers, this temple is worth your time. Enjoy!"

This entire area, part of Singapore's Downtown Core is a cultural melting pot. For many years I have visited Singapore and completely missed this area altogether. So when I got the chance to spend some time exploring the area, I was surprised by the dynamism the Telok Ayer area still projects. Telok Ayer Street used to be the original coastal road before land reclaimation and gentrification extended Singapore's core southwards. This was the main marketplace and landing point for Chinese immigrants and was the cradle of Singapore's Chinatown district."

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",5,"Thian Hock Keng (literally ""Palace of Heavenly Happiness""), also known as the Tianfu Temple, is a temple built for the worship of Mazu (""Ma Cho Po""), a Chinese sea goddess, located in Singapore. It is the oldest and most important temple of the Hokkien(Hoklo) people in the country. Another shrine at the back is Buddhist dedicated to Guanyin, the Mahayana Buddhist bodhisattva of mercy.

The temple originated as a small joss housefirst built around 1821–1822 at the waterfront serving the local Hokkien community, where seafarers and immigrants may give thanks to the sea goddess Mazu for a safe sea passage on their arrival to Singapore. The temple is located on Telok Ayer Street that originally ran along the coastline before land reclamation work began in the 1880s. Starting in 1839, the temple was rebuilt with funds collected over the years and donations from the community, the largest of which was from Tan Tock Seng, a Hokkien businessman. The building materials of the temple and a statue of Mazu was brought over from China, with the statue enshrined in the main hall of the temple in 1840. Some of the building materials, such as stone for the columns, timber as well as tiles were recycled from ballasts in ships. The local Indian community of Chulia Street also helped build the temple, and a statue of a man who appears to be an Indian holding a beam up at the ceiling was placed in the right wing as a reminder and gesture for their contribution. The temple was completed in 1842 at a cost of 30,000 Spanish dollars.

The main deity worshiped in the temple is Mazu (""Ma Cho Po""), a 10th century Fujianeseshamaness deified as a Chinese sea goddess. Early immigrants to Singapore offered incense to the goddess to give thanks for a safe passage across the sea from China. Today's worshippers come to the temple to pray for peace, protection and good health.[9]

A smaller shrine to Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, is located at the back. Other deities worshiped in the temple include Baosheng Dadi (God of Medicine and Health), Guansheng Dijun (關聖帝君, worshipped for spiritual protection), Kai Zhang Seng Wang (開漳聖王, the Sacred Governor Kai Zhang), Qie Lan Pu Sa (伽藍聖王, Boddhisattva Sangharama) and Cheng Huang Ye (城隍爺, the City God). Confucius is also venerated in the temple."

It started as a little shrine just in front of the shoreline to give thanks to Mazu (妈祖), Goddess of Seas, for their safe voyage. And as the number of the Chinese immigrant increased in years, so it was decided that permanent temple should be build to replace the shrine. So the construction began in 1839 and was completed three years later.

This is really an astonishing temple, it is beautiful, and also a haven of tranquillity. Dominated by black for its interior and exterior, is different from any other Buddist temple I’ve seen where red is the dominant color. If you ever come close to this area, or if you’re interest in oriental style or design, you might want to consider to make stop to visit Thian Hock Keng."

天福宮建造於1839年至1842年之間，是新加坡最古老、最重要的閩幫廟宇，主殿供奉護航之神“媽祖娘娘”，凡南來或北歸的華人，都把船舶碇在宮前，然後向媽祖娘娘祈求“海不揚波，平安返國”。光绪皇帝在 1907 年還親自题字寫了“波靖南溟”匾牌 .

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",5,"(Translated by Google) In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, Singapore’s Chinatown was gradually forming a Chinese settlement dominated by Fujian immigrants.

Until the rebuilding of the sea in the 1880s, Tianfu Palace was not only close to the seashore, but also facing the sea.
In 1839, the residents of Chinatown reconsidered to rebuild the Mazu Temple, and the businessman and philanthropist Chen Yusheng donated Yudo, thus retaining his name. In 1840, Tianfu Palace was started, and its Liangzhu building materials and Mazu statues were all imported from China. During the construction of the temple, there was no shortage of Singaporean Indian communities to help each other. They placed a statue of an Indian in the gap between the temple and the pillars. Thank you for your in mind. In 1842, the Tianfu Palace was completed, and a total of 30,000 Spanish silver rounds were spent.

In 1906, Tianfu Palace was rebuilt, and the glazed iron gates and tiled bricks of the Western Glasgow style were added to the appearance of Tianfu Palace. In the 33rd year of Guangxu (1907), the Emperor Guangxu’s title, “Bojing Nanxun”, was given to Tianfu Palace.

清代中叶，新加坡牛车水渐渐形成以福建移民为主的华人聚落，约莫在公元1821至1822年间，当地华人起盖一间祭祀妈祖的简陋庙宇，聊表对妈祖庇佑南渡航行平安的感激之意。而直到1880年代填海造陆之前，天福宫不仅紧临海滨，且面向大海。
公元1839年，牛车水居民商议重建妈祖庙，商人兼慈善家陈笃生捐纳尤多，因而留名。1840年，天福宫动工兴建，其梁柱建材与妈祖塑像等皆引自中国。建庙期间，不乏新加坡印度社群鼎力相助，遂在庙宇梁柱间隙中摆置一名印度人外表的塑像，感谢铭记。1842年天福宫落成，总计斥资三万西班牙银圆
1840年天福宫落成后，便由福建会馆主导庙宇一切的庶务。1849年，天福宫正殿龙边扩建崇文塔。1906年天福宫重启修建，西洋格拉斯哥式样的锻铁铁门与平铺砖块添入天福宫的外貌。光绪33年（1907年），光绪皇帝题款“波靖南溟”匾，御赐天福宫。1913年，天福宫增建凉亭，而此凉亭曾经出借予中华女子学校。
1973年，新加坡古迹保存局指定天福宫为国家古迹，修缮前，绘制设计草稿的是台湾知名传统庙宇建筑师—谢自南。1998年，天福宫再度进行大规模的修建工程，此次修建历时两年，耗资两百二十万美金。2001年，天福宫获得联合国教科文组织颁布的亚太区文物保护奖。"

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",4,"(Translated by Google) Tianfu Palace is the oldest temple built by the Minnan people in Singapore.

Generally speaking, before 1979, the Fujian dialect was the common language in the Singapore Chinese community. There are many ethnic minorities in Singapore such as Malays and Indians who even communicate with Singaporean Chinese in Fujianese.

However, after 1979, the Singapore government began to vigorously promote Chinese (Mandarin, Chinese, Taiwanese Mandarin), with the Chinese-speaking movement as a guide, and conducted a lot of strict censorship and banning of various Chinese dialect media. Many Chinese dialect media must match Chinese to be broadcast. At the same time, Singapore gradually abolished the Chinese school system in the 1980s. All schools adopted English as the main medium of instruction. As a result, English became Singapore's most powerful language. Therefore, the rise of English and the popularity of Chinese have accelerated the decline of Fujian dialect in Singapore.

(Original)
天福宮是閩南人在新加坡所建的最古老的寺廟。

一般來說，在1979年之前，福建話是新加坡華人社群中的共同語。有許多新加坡的少數民族如馬來人、印度人更是以福建話跟新加坡華人進行溝通。

然而到了1979年之後，新加坡政府開始大力推廣華語(中國普通話、中文、台灣國國語)，以講華語運動做為先導，對各種漢語方言傳媒進行諸多嚴格審查及禁播。許多漢語方言傳媒都必須搭配華語才可播放上陣。與此同時，新加坡又於1980年代逐步廢除華校制度，所有的學校都一律採用英語為主要教學媒介語言，遂導致英語成為新加坡最強勢的語言。因此，英語的興起與華語的普及化加速了福建話在新加坡的衰微。"

"Thian Hock Keng Temple, Singapore",5,"(Translated by Google) Come today, the Jade Palace is not open. Instructions on the door: No sorrow.

Six pentols refers to penis, peninsula, peninsula, peninsula, penshen, pens. On the Day of the Sixth Pentagon, the qi of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements must change, which is not good for people.

Eurasian Heritage Centre: Singapore Attraction,5,"A quaint gallery with heaps on information on Singapore's Eurasian community, history, prominent icons, lifestyles and also their flavourful cuisine. The gallery is a must-visit. It is also very clean and they will also give you a disposable glove, tissues and a guide on the place. I liked that additional attention to detail on sanitation especially in these times. Also, if you want to indulge yourself into their flavourful delectable Eurasian food, head down to Quentin's thereafter and you would not leave disappointed. I love frequenting that restaurant every now and then."
Eurasian Heritage Centre: Singapore Attraction,5,"A beautiful gallery featuring stories and personalities from the Eurasian community. My favourite section was ""My grandfather's Road"" good information on whom some streets were named after. Gallery staff were welcoming and helpful.

The gallery space is cosy and the air con is at its best, might want to bring a shawl if you plan to be in the gallery for a while."
Eurasian Heritage Centre: Singapore Attraction,5,I visited the Eurasian Heritage Gallery during the My Community Festival and it was a very fruitful experience. The guides Alison and Petrina were very passionate and shared many stories and knowledge on Eurasian culture with the participants. The tour also included a delicious 4-course lunch from the Quentin’s on a well decorated table. There was even a “gift exchange” with presents already prepared by the staff. The entire itinerary was well thought out and was full of Christmas vibe.

Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Marvellous looking building:)
This is a HDB project and it is not a private project.

Govt really put effort to do this !

The sky garden is one of a kind.

The view is a million dollars as compared to other places.

Good for fresh air and for people to rest their eyes with the view:)

Therapy for the eyes and soul at the sky garden :)"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice HDB flats and can find a family of chicken wandering around..😁
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Best view for only 6$, no need to buy expensive drinks, dress up, wait in line. Perfect for people who travel on a budget. You can have a walk on the viewing platform. We stayed up there for at least one hour. You can’t see the marina bay sands."
Pinnacle@Duxton,1,"Excellent views from the 50th floor but it looks like the place has been sorely neglected by the maintenance staff. Perhaps they were going for a post apocalyptic look?
With loose tiles and deck chairs that I doubt anyone would actually sit on, it’s sheer lazy work for such a landmark project!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"5 stars for the sky bridge. The sunset view up there is quite something to behold. If you are a first time traveler to Singapore, this is a must check location. Note that you have to make payment at the admin office at Block G before going up."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"This place is huge and is like a maze. Depending on the time of year you visit, you can only purchase tickets to go up to the 50th floor in certain sections of the condo complex. It took us probably 45 minutes just to find where but I highly recommend it. Once you get to the top it is very quiet and there are lots of areas for you to take photos.  You can walk around all of the condo complexes and once on the 50th floor you it's pretty organized and easy to see which complex you are at."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Living at this unique and well-situated HDB complex brings pride to all the (mostly) middle-class families here.

Pinnacle boasts of one of the highest fertility rates in the country (from my observations), simply because couples live in financial bliss with the reassuring knowledge that the price of their property will remain high (and thus have more children). Growing up in Pinnacle, my siblings and I faced no shortage of childhood companions because there were just so many children!

I think the best part of living at Pinnacle is the amazing access to sporting areas. On the 3rd floor, there are multiple playgrounds for young children. For older children, they can choose to use the basketball court, or just scoot over to the nearby football court at Duxton Plain Park (which is also connected to Pinnacle). Badminton enthusiasts can book facilities at the Community Club, which is also connected to Pinnacle via a link bridge. If you are a cardio person, the 500m jogging track on the 26th storey is for you, with stunning views of the city skyline.

Parking is standard for the Tanjong Pagar area. If you want cheap parking, head over to the multi-storey carpark at Everton/Spottiswoode.

The only cons of Pinnacle are the badly-desighed carparks and ugly lift lobbies, but that is tolerable once you get used to it."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Nice ambience place for relaxing
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Hidden photography spot/gem. Its worth while going up to the 50th floor (with a small fee). You get a panoramic view of the financial district and urban living of Singapore.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,I live here with my employer family. Such a nice place
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"This was a good surprise, What a view of Singapore for sgd 6. I enjoyed the view from 50 floor."
Pinnacle@Duxton,1,"The observation deck on level 50 is a scam. I bought a ticket at reception to go up the elevator, but when I got to the elevator I was told that the observation deck was closed because the floor was wet. It had been raining that day. When I asked for a refund they told me that no refunds are possible even though I had just purchased the ticket less than a minute earlier. The whole thing is a scam. Don't waste your time coming here or your money. I wasted both."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Awesome view of the city from the Sky Garden on the 50th level.

To gain access you need your MRT card and need to find the little offixe at 1G to gain access to lifts to the sky garden.

Views are priceless."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Visited my aunt's place here during CNY. Probably one of the most ambitious & beautiful HDB project in Singapore. The 26th floor sky garden & 50th floor rooftop garden is a must-go! Perfect photo spots for CNY OOTD especially HAHA. But you'll need a resident card to tap in or get a visitor pass to get in. The blocks are linked on the 3rd, 26th & 50th floor. Nice rooftop running track - exercise with a view! Those who bought this unit 15yrs ago from HDB have effectively doubled their investment already. Great location & view! Worth a visit!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Superb views from the 50th floor. Very much with the 6sgd ticket . Best time to visit is during sunset.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Amazing view of the city. Visited my friends place here. The view from 50th floor is breathtaking where one can look at the blue ocean, sky scrappers and the old style buildings. Truly a view of Singapore. Tourists can also visit the 50th floor to have a view. It is ticketed-about 6 SGD."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Amazing architecture smacked right in the city. Morning and late afternoon would be a great time to get there for a breathtaking view of Singapore at the 50th floor.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"The award winning Pinnacle @ Duxton, probably the jewel in HDB portfolio. The 50th storey roof garden offers a panoramic view of the island's business district and world class port. Personally I find the layout confusing and the units too densely packed. However, this modern design is suitable for this tiny island state."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Interesting housing in Singapore, they allow visitor to go to sky bridge in 50th floor. The ticket only 6 SGD"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Costing only 5$ (SGD) to get to the rooftop, this is one of the best deals in town to have a view of the city skyline. When on top, just walk around from building (A-G) to building to have a view on the whole city and the Straits.
Entrance is from level 1 on the G complex. You need an EZ-link card to pay for entry. You can get one in the corner shop, but I would really recommend getting one at a 7-11 or similar before getting in this area."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Breathtaking views.
Jogging tracks and kids' playgrounds , gym and everything is so convenient"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"One of the best views from 50 floors up in Singapore for only $5 (they only accept EZ-link transit card) if you're not a building resident. Head over to the first floor of 1G building to pay the entrance fee at the management office. The building complex is pretty cool unto itself, especially considering it's a public housing building. The viewing platform also happens to be part of the world's longest sky garden at 500 in length."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,The most expensive HDB with an amazing 360° view at their skybridges on 50 & 26/F
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"So far this is my favorite observation point in Singapore. Quiet and unique, looks like a park on rooftop. Nice for sunset watching.
Don’t forget to bring your EZ-LINK card and $6 in cash."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Never thought HDB can be so beautiful.. Perfect in all ways. Just look at this night view 🤩
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,very nice sceneries at the highest floor.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"So huge condo, very nice view on the top opened to public for 6sgd entry with ez link card."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"1. Offers good views of Singapore CBD.
2.  You can see the container port and Brani Island on other side. 3. 50 stories high.
4. It's HDB and not that well maintained.
5. The views are awesome. Good place to be if you like taking photos of cityscapes and sunsets.
6.  Entry fees, 6 SGD."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Lovely experience on the terrace and running track on 26th floor!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Sky park gives an fantastic view during sunset! What else can I ask for?
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Do visit the top roof garden! It's breathtaking and you get a peaceful time on your own.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,It's the tallest public housing development estate as of Year 2021 and may be for many decades to come.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Not very touristic, though popular among local people. You can visit the building rooftop in block 1G by paying 6 SGD. What was strange was that we needed a EZ card used mostly for transportion around the city. We were lucky to meet someone there who helped us with this. Other then this situation, we enjoyed a nice sightseeing tour of the rooftop with amazing views of the city"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Stunning views from the 50th floor rooftop garden/sky deck. SGD6 per person for entry.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice view of the city at the top. Would recommend others to come
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"The name explains it all (The pinnacle) can never be another  , the peak of perfection"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great view on their sky bridge
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Only $6 for stunning views!
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Great place, only one of a kind HDB flats in SG. Need access card to access the connecting blocks, wonderful view of the city"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Experience was pretty good. You can have nice scenery of the harbour in sunset. $5 is worth spending.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great city view at most affordable price $6 ($5?) per pax.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Awesome night view from the top of Pinnacle. You can go to Bloack G to purchase a ticket to take a lift to the top. don't forget to go for dessert at the nearby hawker centre. Try the curry puff and nyonya kueh and the tau suan.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,PLEASE NOTE: operating timing is....
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Skybridge on 50th level one of the best viewing decks in Singapore. Great view to Downtown, port and other part of Singapore"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"The building's upper sky deck is accessible against a small fee. It offers stunning views over the city as well as a relaxing environment to spend quite some time. There are no other facilities up there, although some seating is available."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Love the sky balcony! The sky balcony os on the 50th floor, so You have an amazing few on the different districts of singapore, port, business district etc. You can't see gardens by the bay though. Nevertheless, highly recommenden to go up for the sunset and stay until it's dark, so you can enjoy all the lights."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Looks beautiful but still offers nothing more than any other HDB
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Awesome views from the top. Living there is not too busy, as one might imagine, but the facilities do seem a little old inside."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Home sweet home
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Gorgeous and cheap observation deck in a residential block
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"I am a resident here and it is possibly the best hdb in the entire island. It is walking distance to chinatown and tanjong pagar, and the skybridges allow many amenities to be discovered. Also there is basketball and futsal courts nearby for ballers. Many food options here. I am proud to say that i am a resident here. Note for those who wanna go 50th story sky bridge, go to block 1G 1st floor to get access."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"I love looking at this building from the outside.Pinnacle has a very strong presence and the design is very sophisticated!

Be careful when visiting the people who live in this building:
It looks like it's close to the station, but there are so many towers to get lost in :)"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Blue Sg parking near my house ... YAY! 🎉
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,Squeezy cramp carpark
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,6SGD entrance fee as of 2019. Good hangout place to take photos of the harbor and CBD skyline. Otherwise nothing much to do. No CR and any food/water establishment in the rooftop garden.
Pinnacle@Duxton,2,👎
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Great view of the city! You can almost see Malaysia to the north, and the hills of Indonesia to the south on a clear day. We have been here many times and we still enjoy and always had a good time here"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Excellent views over the city. The observation level is huge. The small office where you go to pay isn't especially well marked and the guy manning the office wasn't particularly friendly. But it is cheap. I went a bit before sunset.
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,This is the most exotic HDB building in Singapore. The top level has a park and has $5 entry charge. It is a place worth visiting.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,View from my friend unit
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Best views of Singapore with rooftop walkway between all 7 blocks. Great photos day or night with small entry fee. Highly recommend a visit.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"The Pinnacle @ Duxton is the
Tallest HDB building.

Its stands at 50-storeys tall. From the higher floors, you can see all the way to the port of Keppel Harbour, and the whole of Tanjong Pagar and Sentosa.
There's a good heritage garden at the centre of the blocks and one can learn some of the historical facts about Singapore."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Have Skybridge at 26th and 50th floor which you have to pay 6 SGD to access. You have to pay by cash at the reception area, then use Ezlink to open the door at Skybridge. Accessing the skybridge via doors sometimes has problems, please try again if it happens. With this sky, you have full view of city like sentosa island, etc and many things."
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,"This is a good place to park if you are heading to Shake Shack. It is just at the fringe of CBD, so when can avoid ERP CBD charges (with COVID, at the moment ERP CBD charges are suspended)."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Nice flat, high buklding from upstair can see all the sentosa island"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice view at skybridge level 50. Sgd6/entry
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Intriguing architecture. The Sky Garden also offered one of the best panoramic views of the city, even to Sentosa! One of my favourite attractions in Singapore. Just a few blocks away from Chinatown, should be in your itinerary when visiting Chinatown."
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,Nice
Pinnacle@Duxton,2,"One of the most expensive HDB housing estate in Singapore.
The unit is so small and narrow where it does not allow 2 persons walking abreast. Pathetic."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"My friend say bring girls here at rooftop garden can get second date, but if BTO can get here can get second child."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Been here for a school assignment. The place is really tall. Though it's disappointing to pay just for the top view.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,The 50th floor sky bridge gives a good view of the city but the Marina Bay area is obscured by even taller buildings. It is recommended to visit this place  early morning so that the atmosphere is cool.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"It has a HDB lift, but the favourite part is that there is 50 levels in the building! Takes a full minute to go from bottom to top"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Got this view from there .... Amazing
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Good location and iconic apartment.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"This is one prime location and if you live on the higher floors. You will have the spectacular view of Singapore as this place is kinda in the middle of all actions in Singapore. It has also very interesting architecture design that is worth a second look.

We had the opportunity to custom made sofa/headboards and did reupholstery work for a few household here and was impressed by the place! Very lovely people live in this building!!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,You can head up to the skybridge to get a nice view of the surrounding but it would cost you for access if you are not a resident. The overall feel of the area feels nice and premium. Not really a good place to view fireworks as the view is blocked by other buildings nearby.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"A hidden gem in Singapore. Awesome views from the sky deck (almost at 1/3rd the price of some well known sky deck attractions)

It's super underrated. Awesome for photographers and genuine place to have perhaps one of the best views you can get at Singapore. It's a non-commercial place (and I hope it stays that way), so carry your own water / drink / snacks. Although, I think eating is prohibited (not sure).

Will definitely visit again!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,Government flats
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,The rooftop offers a great view of Singapore
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great view
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Reached to 50th storey ....good experience payer just a cost of 6$  can see almost the whole Singapore
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,The most expensive HDB in sg
Pinnacle@Duxton,1,Asset enhancement scam where public housing is priced out of reach of ordinary citizens. The future of younger generation is being held at ransom to sustain the political lie that the value of your 99-year leasehold will keep increasing indefinitely.
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,"The life layput very funny, out of 2 lift in between got 1 block"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,nice place
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Love the running track on the sky terrace, wonderful view of the city from the top floors sky garden and did you know there is a gallery space at the very top of the building? Amazing views. The environment deck on the 2F is peaceful and you can't tell you are in the middle of the bustling city"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Was a resident for years. The most extraordinary place I’ve lived in my whole life. It may not seem that way from the outside, but it’s a blend of cultures and socioeconomic levels on the inside that you just won’t get in a normal HDB or condo. You are living with people from across Singaporean society, and now, across the world. Set in a vibrant, growing neighborhood with a gorgeous green patch out the back. There is a sense of community (for example, the parents and pet owners who chat by the huge banyan tree at the Duxton Plain park), the elderly who exercise every morning, the local Kung fu uncle. There are hundreds of food options within a 10 minute walk, along with at least two grocery stores, fruit vendors. Multiple playgrounds, including on the sky gardens atop the building. The building and exterior design is such that you’d scarcely know that you had 1800 units full of neighbors. It’s a great place to live."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Nice view from the skydeck which is opened for toutists over building G
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Excellent place to stay, 5 star views"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,One of Singapore public Housing. Fantastic view.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"This is a great place to do stair climb exercises. Once you get to the TOP, you’re greeted by a nice swaft of fresh air and a lovely view. The stairwell is reasonably ventilated and there’s drink shops just around the corner for when you’re tired."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Centrally located. Well maintained. Enough greenery within complex. Mini garden, Children playing area, Kindergarten, history monument etc. within complex. Parking place is ventilated though not sufficiently. Greenery even on middle of floors with jogging track."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Nice place for me
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,a very wide view and nice walk on the 50 floor .
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Architecture is great! My friend lives here. If you're here, make sure to visit the deck!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Very nice place and stunning view! You can visit if you’re a non-residents for a small fee.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Love the rooftop garden there, where you can see a paranomic view of the city. It is accessible to public at a fee of $5."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,It a nice view at the top but as it is already more than 5 years it is rather rundown
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"If one is able to go on top of The Pinnacle (for about S$5-S$7), one can enjoy a majestic view. The SkyLine is astonishing. I would recommend one to do so in the afternoon or when the sun is setting - be sure to take some photos!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Excellent location and amenities nearby
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Absolutely awesome place to view Singapore from the top!!! Ticket entrance is located at the 1G building. The price is S$6 pp. You will be asked to have callable phone as you could entrance and leave the roof only by calling to the ticket office.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,My home
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Awesome, best in the afternoon for the closer skyscrapers but for the port and outer Singapore probably best in the morning.  Go to G Block, first level ( ground floor) to pay $5.  Well worth it.  You can take your tripod too.  Great spot for timelapse as well as sunset."
Pinnacle@Duxton,2,Nothing fanciful. Lift area stuffy. Car park area very messy. Always difficilt to locate car park where. Even ask residents themselves and they also don't know and give wrong directions.  The stores below are convenient though. And near bus stop and mrt station is good. Also the police station very near is good. Walking distance to many things.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Went up to the roof top at night to check out the views. $5 using EZlink card if you are not resident. It's great view and breezy. A bit dark but I guess you can call it romantic for couples. If you need to pay to go up, make sure you spend sometime up there to make your money worth. Recommend night time as there are no shelter. It will be too hot during the day."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,A building unlike any other I have seen.. worth the visit for the view at a cheap price as well better than dealing with the crowd at mbs too...
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"This is in fact, a public housing project by the housing and development board in Singapore. Public housing in Singapore has come a long way. A visit to Tiong Bahru estate will allow you to see the olden public housing and this project presents a stark contrast to that. We have come a long way!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"A hidden-in-plain-sight gem. A wonderfully architected public housing project with spectacular views of the city. You need to pay a nominal sum to go up, please pay and have an unforgettable experience!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Really good views and only $6 per person. The viewing platform is huge and there is hardly anyone there. To enter, go to building G, entry to the ticket office is next to the convinience store on ground floor. For best views of the city skyline go there in the afternoon."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Great view from the top floor but now need to pay to go up...Still worth the while for the panaromic view of Singapore ...the harbour, the city,  the bay area, etc. Lots of good restaurants in vicinity"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Lovely neighborhood packed with awesome amenities all round. Resident gets access to proper jogging track on sky park, indoor badminton courts and activities by connecting community center. Cozy cafes, top restaurants and local foodfare is what you get in this one special place."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Cool place
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Very good place to see city view. Recommend at night especially.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,The view from the top is a much better experience than Ce La Vie at MBS.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Majestic!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"You can get stunning aerial views of the city, including the downtown area and port. You can enter this building using your EZLink card. The entry fee is 5 SGD per person. There are lots of benches and sheltered places to rest in the top floor"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great observation deck that you can pay and go up in. I cannot imagine living in such a busy complex personally though ... So many floors and so many units.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Going there for drinking with collaegue. The place good
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Very near to outram and tanjong pagar mrt st.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Cheap version of marina bay sand view of Singapore cityscape. Every friend of mine that came here was impressed by the view. Need to pay thou.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Paid a fee of SGD5 at Block 1G. Went up during sunset. The city view was great! Was windy and there had many areas to chill and lounge. Wonderful experience!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Great place to see the skyline of Singapore at night at a cheap price. Go up to the 50th storey, and walk across the the buildings that are all connected together."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice view!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,This is the best building to live in Singapore. Haven't been to apartmemts like this before. The sky garden is beautiful with awesome city and sea view.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Pretty cool looking HDB. Decent location, steps up (climbing stairs) to most public places but overall easy to find and get to. Iconic."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,One of the most unique building. On 50th floor is observation deck offering 360d views of Singapore
Pinnacle@Duxton,1,"They didn’t let me go up to the skybridge, and when I asked why the receptionist bit my head off saying his system doesn’t let people up bc it’s raining. It clearly wasn’t. Dude, hope you get that you live off of tourists going up that bridge."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Pinnacle@Duxton are seven connected towers located at Singapore's city center. The buildings are the world's tallest public residential buildings at a height of 159.7 m / 524 ft. The construction for Pinnacle@Duxton started on April 2005 and was completed in 2009 and it has 2 sky gardens located on the 26th and 50th floors. The 26th floor skybridge links all 7 towers.
The 50th floor skybridge is open to the public and you can enjoy scenic views of the city by paying $S5. Go to tower 1G which faces Cantonment Road to reach the lift to get to the skybridges. Call to check for opening time, it closes for Chinese New Year."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,View here epic. Atas hdb
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Amazing experience on the 50th storey skybridge! With just 6S$ you have access to this overhead runaway. Thousands of people living under your feet as you are admiring the panorama of the metropolis. One star less due to the listlessness of the staff at the ticketing office
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Awesome view from terrace. Loved the place
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Spectacular view fr the top flr gdn. Such  convenient location where to find
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Beautiful view from the skybridge, but the ticket booth can be a bit difficult to find. In block G, next to some convenience stores is a small shack where you can buy a ticket.

You need an EzLink card for this (Public Transport tourist pass for example)."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,For 6SGD you can go to the 50th floor deck for an amazing 360∅ view of Singapore ... Well worth the money.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Amazing views of Singapore from 50th floor.  Wonderful use of outside space and  excellent example of social housing.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,On 2018 I bought ticket at Management Agent Office on 1st floor Block 1G. It's near bus stop no.05519. Please note that you must have EZlink Card for register as a sky garden access key card and pay cash 6SGD to go up there.Great view on 50th floor rooftop sky garden especially evening time.  Enjoy!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Great view, highly recommended.
Here are the instructuons on how to get to the sky bridge:

Make payment at M.A. Office @ S$6/- Cash per
person

Register EZ-Link Card/Any CEPAS enabled card
Proceed to Lift Lobby at Block 1G(Behind M.A.
Office

Take Lift A or B and proceed up to level 50
Move inside the turnstile and then tap Registered
EZ-Link Card/CEPAS-enabled card to enter
Skybridge

Enter & Exit Skybridge ONLY AT BLOCK 1G LEVEL
50 using Registered EZ-Link / CEPAS-enabled card"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,If you ever visit Singapore and want see this nation on a wonderful way. Goto this building. At Block 1G you can buy a ticket 5SGD and you can go on top of this building. Walk around and you have nice skyline view of Singapore. Its open till 11PM in evening!!!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"It’s 6$ to go up to the skybridge on the 50th floor. You have to pay cash and you need an mrt card. There are different areas where you can sit, relax and get a great view over Singapore."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"The Skybridge is easy to find if you know what youre looking for. Find Block 1G and at Level 1 find the little office to pay your $6 entry fee to be registered into your CEPAS or ezlink card. Only elevators A or B take you to level 50. Once there, enjoy the view! There is very little shade so visiting at night is much cooler. Be advised the last entry is at 21:00. There are no restrooms, so sort that out before taking the trip."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,One of the best housing development board subsidised residential complex in Singapore
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"An contemporary urban scape with high population density but ample living environmemt, public spaces tangled with private spaces......a good demonstration for high density development in crowded cities."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Nice view from the rooftop. Can be frying hot during the day...
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice rooftop if you have an MRT
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,Good chicken wings and French food. Great place to gather.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Beautiful HDB flats. Goo view of city.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Haha, always go there for Community events"
Pinnacle@Duxton,1,"Today is our last day at singapore and had a very bad service at the ticketing office of the duxton bridge!! The guy sitting over at the ticketing office was not explaining properly. When we asked him to repeat, he said "" i explained you so many times..."". We came back without visiting the skybridge. Better to go to Sentosa island and have the same type of view from Tiger SKy tower. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,The Great view and food is just amazing !!!
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Super great view of Singapore a must do before you go ! Cost 6$
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,The tallest residential building in Tanjong Pagar with roof top opening to the public with a fee during national day. Very nice surrounding view. There is another lower level that is for the resident to exercise like jogging... Great plc
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,A great place to view Singapore's impressive Central Business District as well as the surrounding area.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Very nice roof top. Publicly accessible. S$ 6.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Amazing view... bring an EZ link card!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great view from the TOP. Note the viewing deck needs you to register at block 1 G before going up and it costs 6 sgd per person to go up
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,One of the most beautiful HDB Development
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Well architecturally designed building has now become an icon of the Singaporean skyline
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Good location, beside a minimart and bus stop."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"This ""housing complex"" with sky gardens and sky bridges connecting the sky towers to each other is a proud of HDB. HDB is well-known by all residents in Singapore as they build flats for more than 80% families in Singapore. In the old days, to cut down cost the HDB flats are usually standard, poor designed ... However, nowadays, HDB flats are closer and closer to private condominium apartments. And, this Pinnacle is the first and most reprensentable of this trend."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Amazing place with amazing view! Nice place to jog, take photos and relax."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Great viewing platform on the top of these 50 storey blocks with fantastic views over Sentosa Island, the Tanjong Pager Wharfs and Container Terminal and the City ..... Virtually 360° views of Singapore South, small S$6 charge to viewing level"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Very good views from here. The carpark is a mess, I got lost in it."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"This award-winning public housing development is called home by more than 2,000 Singaporeans. It is made up of seven 50-storey blocks which are connected by two skybridges, one on the 26th floor and another on the 50th floor. Pinnacle@Duxton was one of the most sought after developments when it was launched because of its design and location.

The entrance fee is but a fraction of the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark and you don’t have to ‘buy a drink’ like at other rooftop F&B establishments, the views are equally (or even more) stunning as it is located right in the middle of Singapore and also has 360 degree views of the city, plus it’s less touristy which equals less crowds. Enough said!

Bring your EZ-Link card (the top-up card for public transport) and proceed to the Level 1 counter at Block 1G for payment and registration."
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,The place is nice with stunning views but it has not been maintained properly with maintenance workers regularly cutting corners
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"I used to live in that awesome place
Flat E
Floor 46
It's just amazing"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Sky garden is very cool but costs $5 for non-residents to enter. Also you can only pay with CEPAS (EZ-Link, etc.)"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Good place to hang out, and they have caviar in a good price too!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Really nice place, great views, and an awesome dining facility Essens."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Beuatiful panaromic views of singapore city at just $6!!!!:))
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"Spectacular views ...slightly hard to work out where to pay to get up, but worth the effort!"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Hdb flats with their own garden access! Super cool
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"I was on the top of the building on Singapore 52nd birthday, I watched the sunset with the air Force bringing the flag of Singapore, very great experience indeed :)

The entrance fee is 6sgd"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,dude this my place
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"P@D is Singapore's showcase of public housing. Located at Tanjong Pagar, it is also the tallest cluster of HDB flats in land scarce Singapore. There's a sky bridge linking the buildings and you can catch breathtaking views of the city, the port and the sea."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Very nice building in the central location with easy access of public transport. A beautiful public housing with unique and beautifil design!
26th storey  a nice place for jogging with good breeze!
Very beautiful city and sea view from the 50th level especially fascinate night scene of Singapore !
Nice plants all over at the 50th storey and there even having special seats to sit down at some areas!
Public able to go up to view the beautiful scenery at 50th floor and purchase the ticket from the small office at 1G.
I think office hours or until certain time at nigh hours.
The viewing deck usually close before 10 pm  , to be sure please check with the office.
There is a nice eating place and like a casual pub very near The Pinnacle.
There are many nice eating places and restaurants within walking distance !"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,My man always come there
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,One of the best kept secrets in Singapore. Awesome views towards harbour and downtown skyline.
Pinnacle@Duxton,3,Cool pavilion to rest your aching feet
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,You can see everything on top
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Great views of the city. Paying and getting up there might be cumbersome. Only works with EZ link card and no other CEPAS cards.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Definitely the Pinnacle of public housing in SG. The public access to the roof garden (S$5) is a nominal fee for the fantastic view of the cityscape.

Do note: you'll need an Ez-link or a CEPAS card for the payment."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Go to the 50th floor for a great view over the city !
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Good HDB with nice view.

Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Beautiful scenery at 50 floor
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Awesome architecture with a great view of the city at the TOP!
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Awesome view from the top
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"Although the website says you can only pay the 5SGD entrance fee with your ezlink card, it's also possible to just pay by cash. There's a guy sitting at the first floor right next to the ticket vending machine who will help you with that. The view from the skybridge at the 50th floor is amazing and really worth it! Altough the double fence hinders one from taking good panoramic photos, the ambience and the view are fantastic."
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Nice building. Good architechture. The view from the skybridge is really amazing. Only glitch the ticketing machine in the lobby doesnt work and you have to call the guy at maintenance office to turn on thw turnstile so as to enter and exit the skybridge.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Overpriced and only for people at the pinnacle of wealth. Which is everyone in Singapore except for me. I have low self esteem issues.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,The Skybridge on the 50th floor offers a wonderful view
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,High quality public housing. Great design.
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,most atas HDB in Singapore
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,Best S$5 you can spend in Singapore! Make sure you go up here.
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,Remember to buy the entrance tickets at Blk G Level One ($6) before you can access the 50th floor skypark.

Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) Convenient for high-rise scenery and subway
Ground-level restaurants have everything

高楼风景地铁方便
地面餐馆应有尽有"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) The view and the living environment are super nice. Plus, it ’s just less than 5 min walk to the mrt which is very convenient !!

The living environment here is very good, there are basketball courts and running tracks, and it is less than five minutes walk from the subway station. If you really want to pick one disadvantage, the opposite building will start construction at 9 o'clock in the morning, which will slightly affect sleep. Everything else is perfect.

這裡的居住環境很不錯，有籃球場還有跑道，離地鐵站也只有走路不到五分鐘的距離。若要真的挑一個缺點，那就是早上九點多開始對面的樓房會開始施工，稍微影響睡眠，其餘的一切都很完美👍🏻"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) Friends want to see Singapore from above for a buck so come here it's the largest apartment building in the world in one of the blocks is a box office where I think for $ 5 or $ 6 you will go to the roof and have a city roof quiet crawl as long as you want

(Original)
Přátelé chcete vidět singapur ze shora za babku tak si zajděte sem je to největší bytová budova na světě v jednom z bloků je pokladna kde myslím že za 5 nebo 6 dolaru se vyvezete na střechu a máte město jak na dlani bloky jsou propojeny chodníky tak můžete po střeše klidné procházet jak dlouho chcete"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"(Translated by Google) It's really big here, with blocks A to G, and the topmost sky garden connects the blocks. The appearance is magnificent. Visitors to the top floor must buy tickets at the underground ticket office. They need to use an elink to shoot the card to the top, and they can only take one shot. I personally think that it should be open for free, because skyville is free of charge. Also not close to the subway station, it takes more than 10 minutes to walk to Outram.

(Original)
這裡的確很大，有A至G座，最頂層空中花園連接各座。外觀很宏偉，遊客到最頂層參觀必需到地下售票處買票，需要用一張elink拍卡登頂，而且只能拍一次。個人認為應該要免費開放參觀，因為skyville是不收費的。另外不靠近地鐵站，步行到Outram需10多分鐘。"
Pinnacle@Duxton,4,"(Translated by Google) You need to buy Easy Link Card at Metro Station in advance. The nearby Metro station is near the police station.
Since there is a manager on the first floor of the 1G building, if you pass the card and 6 $, you will be registered on the roof.
You may be told that you do not have money if you do not have the right money.
Please note that you can only return from the G-building when you go out on the roof and return.
The scenery is exceptionally good!

Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) Spectacular 360 * views of Singapore, on the top floor of 3 buildings that communicate with each other, you can enter with the subway ticket and access the elevator to the 50th floor.
They are social buildings, to which only Singaporeans accede.

Lo recomiendo"
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) It's worth looking at from the outside. Unfortunately I was not in it.
A 50-story residential complex: All 7 interconnected high-rise buildings together form the highest publicly accessible residential complex worldwide. Impressive architecture with the Sky Bridges, i.e. connecting bridges, on the 26th and 50th floors, opened in 2010. These houses can always be seen from the distance. They are located in the city center and very close to the financial district and the many Korean restaurants on Tg Pagar Rd.

(Original)
Von außen anschauen lohnt sich. Drin war ich leider nicht.
Eine 50-stöckige Wohnanlage: Alle 7 miteinander verbundenen Hochhäuser bilden zusammen die höchste öffentlich zugängliche Wohnanlage weltweit. Beeindruckende Architektur mit den Sky Bridges, also Verbindungsbrücken, im 26. und im 50 Stockwerk, eröffnet in 2010. Diese Häuser erkennt man immer wieder vom Weiten. Sie liegen im City Centre und ganz nahe beim Financial District und bei den vielen koreanischen Restaurants auf der Tg Pagar Rd."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) SG $ 6 per person, with transportation card. Finding where to pay is a bit difficult. Once on the 50th floor the view is magnificent. A must-see place in Singapore. There are very few people, and the view is superb. Serenity and beauty of the landscape.

(Original)
6 dollars SG par personne, avec la carte des transports. Il est un peu difficile de trouver où payer. Une fois au 50ieme étage la vue est magnifique. Un incontournable endroit de Singapour. Il y a très peu de monde, et la vue est superbe. Sérénité et beauté du paysage."
Pinnacle@Duxton,5,"(Translated by Google) Worth to visit! For just $ 6 you can enjoy the great view, it is best to arrive at 6pm!

要先在一樓的警衛室付錢，並且要自備 ezlink，因為他會用你的 ezlink 做紀錄，等到上樓的時候必須用 ezlink 刷才能進去空中花園，而進去之後的景觀十分壯麗，可以看見 360 度不同的風景，還有一些裝置藝術以及躺椅在上面，十分悠閒。

Hajjah Fatimah Mosque,5,"Mdm Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman was a tradeswoman and philanthropist. She was born in Malacca to a well-known and wealthy trading family. After her first marriage failed, she married a Bugis merchant-prince, Daing Chanda Pulih.

Unfortunately her husband died not long after they married.  She then took over his business. Mdm Hajjah Fatimah already had several boats of her own, and making good use of her late husband’s extensive network, she expanded the business significantly.

In the late 1830s, Hajjah Fatimah built herself a large house in Kampong Glam but, as was common during those times, thieves ransacked her house twice. On the second occasion, they burned it down. Fortunately, she was away at the time and was not harmed.

To demonstrate her gratitude to divine providence for having spared her life, Hajjah Fatimah built a mosque, between 1845 and 1846, on the land where her residence once stood. The mosque was eventually named after her - Hajjah Fatimah Mosque.

Combining eastern and western design elements, the mosque is known for its unique minaret, which resembles a church spire, and the noticeable tilt of its minaret, which has led some to refer to it as the “leaning tower of Singapore”. The mosque was gazetted as a national monument on 28 June 1973."

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Visiting the place again after 30 years.   Glad that the park is kept clean but the 10 courts of Hell is still under renovation and will only be receiving visitors from 28 Oct.

Bring loose change as payment is by honesty and no change will be given.

Free admission and the park isn't crowded."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Quite an interesting place. It was built by the Tiger Balm brothers. As someone not familiar with Chinese mythology, I was quite confused by the stories portrayed in the exhibit and statues. I would recommend doing the guided tour so you can understand better and get the most of your visit. The placards at each exhibit seem like a summary of the story that then have been Google translated so it didn't make a lot of sense.

Some of the statues are quite creepy. None of my Singaporean friends wanted to visit Haw Par Villa because they have were scared of the statues when they saw them as children.

We spent little more than an hour walking around and while it was interesting, this place wouldn't be on the top of my list of places to visit in Singapore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The first thing you must visit is the 10 STAGES IN COURT OF HELL. 😱👺👹💀😎.

The park have statues that was crafted in the early 70s and have  foretold stories from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends etc. I have been here since my early childhood with my parent , then with my schoolmate  and later with family and children. Very nice place to walk asit fill with heritages. 👌👍🧧👏🙂"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting spot with a shortcut into kent ridge hikes
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Good Place to know about the Chinese Ancient Scripts, Tradition and their Sulptures. Most people feel this place is creepy but its not. The Architectures and the Sculptures are really good to admire. There is also a small Buddha temple inside. There is no proper restaurants though. Restrooms are available. Its free of charge, People visiting Chinese Garden also should visit this place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice walking with many sculptures and stories. Recommended for an evening walk to avoid the sunshine if it is too hot weather.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A interesting place. With lots of chinese cultural sculptures. I learned a lot.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Visited after reopening in 1 July. Although the two main sections (Hell museum, 10 stages) were not open it still had a couple of statues with descriptions. Seems like management is trying to open new f&b venues inside the park but not open at this point. Quite an exotic experience free of charge!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"If you are looking for an unusual walking experience, this one is definitely for you.
We've spent around 1.5h there. Unfortunately, the courts of hell were closed, so we would have to come back.
The park is quite large and very fun.
I wish they put indications on where to start reading sculpture descriptions because we started both times from the end and realised it only when we reached the opposite end. So watch out before you immerse yourself into the story!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Rich heritage place with original artefacts n statues that have been around since earlier days. However, the road downhill can be very very slippery during rainy day. Please watch out for your kids. Carpark at $5 per entry."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Aw Boon Haw built the villa for his younger bro, Boon Par in the 1930s. It’s gardens became a theme park for Chinese Mythology. Dump it has it that statues are actually dead bodies covered in wax.

The Ten Courts of Hell exhibit is particularly gruesome. Sculpture depict gruesome punishments awaiting sinners after death. It is said that as the sun sets e statues come to life! Night guards have said that they hear screams coming from the statues at night and as such, offerings are laid out for protection.

Another stop in my SPOOKY SINGAPORE TOUR! Great at night!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I had forgotten how big and steep this place is. The last time I came here was in the 90s!

The sculptures needs a lot of touch ups - pain was peeling and they looked outdated. But overall I had a very pleasant experience. The sculptures brought back childhood memories. I liked the ""charity box"" that was placed all over the park - for buying snacks and also buying food for the fishes and turtles. I just hope that no one abuses it.

It had plenty of benches and rest areas for visitors to sit and have a picnic or just to enjoy the view.

Bring a hat and fan - it can get quite hot! Am looking forward for the Gates of Hell to open!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Average tourist spot compared to rest of attractions in Singapore. They renovated it for 9 month which is hardly noticeable. Place is very peaceful. Visit if you like to learn about Chinese culture through sculptures.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Not too crowded even on a weekend,  plenty of space to roam amongst all the near life sized dioramas of Chinese folklore,  life style and cultural teachings."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Easy access via MRT. Free entry.
A lot of Chinese legends statues and tales.
The place is interesting for first timer and it’s big. Many sitting spots so you can rest anytime.
The place is old, so many things are worn down but appreciate their efforts to keep this place running with free entry.
You will enjoy a good walk here on a cooler day."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,this place if fun haha can oversee the port and the hell area is so scary!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Just like many locals, my last visit was during my childhood days. Brought back lots of memories. Place looks clean but some of the statues/displays were not taken care of properly. It's such a shame and a heartache to see the place like this. Would highly recommend for those who have great and fond memories with friends and classmates here.  Looking forward to the new management to refurbish the place and the reopening of the 10 levels of Hell."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,right next to the MRT.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's a pretty cool park and it's free so you really can't go wrong. The sculpture are really nice and they all have captions so you can learn about whatever there depicting. The store wasn't open when I went there but it seemed a really small. They have places where you can feed fish and turtles around the park, the food is cheap at like a dollar for a little bag. Overall a really cool experience and I would recommend it no problem."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A lot of fun!! We enjoyed much
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Cool displays. Free of admission and usually pretty quiet. A nice space to stroll around in the afternoon. Some section perhaps are not suitable for children. It’s also very easy to get there by train. The train terminal is just right out the entrance.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This is a great theme park, an eye-opener for me. The descriptions of the histories and legends are delightful. The sculptures are amazing but simple, depicting some horrific scenes without being gory. Overall a wonderful way to spend hours walking in great scenery with the bonus of educating myself. On the downside, there were some cracks here and there, nothing serious."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa is a weird, unique 'theme' park. It has some interesting statues with even more random interesting stories behind it. Bigger than expected, if you plan to read all the stories it can take you 2 hours for sure. Also this place is free, which make it a good tourist attraction. Also very easily accessible as it is right outside haw par villa station. Would recommend to check it out of your in the area."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,An old time legend park.   Very easy access by subway.   It’s all free.  Nothing much change since I was a kid.   My Dad used to bring me here.  Now I brought my son and daughter to visit this park again.   It’s bring all memorable and wonderful time.  Very well maintenance.  Nice and clean.   Some sculpture had been removed.   Overall remain the same especially the ten courts of hell.   Many Chinese legends all over the park.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place is to be seen to be believed. It’s a theme park like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I enjoyed exploring the park, especially the ten courts of hell. The small exhibition about the history of the park and the Tiger balm brothers was rather fascinating. Well worth a visit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Many of you know tiger balm brand. Well this villa is built by the founder. Inside, you can find so many Chinese teachings and legends, including also Buddhism aspects.

The particular one is the 10 courts of hell where they describe in the scary way every court of Chinese or Buddhist hell. You can even see the type of punishment illustrated in detailed statues.

For Chinese legends, u can see the famous ones like monkey King or the white snake legend.

Don't miss it if u r in Singapore and if it is already reopened, as it is free too!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Remembering my childhood fifty years ago, then perched high up atop the hill and the lights of the ships like a city at night... Spent school holidays with relatives there.... Simply unforgettable!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free entrance. Spent about 2hours there. Entrance of Haw par villa is just beside the Haw par villa MRT station (circle line) hence it's easily accessible. There are a lot of statues with detailed description. It's an amazing place to learn about Chinese culture and myths.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Went at night and it was good, spent a whole lot on fish/tortoise food! Felt bad for em and kept getting lots of food haha. The levels of hell is not open currently ;( do check before you go!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting and large park... Can't think of anything I've ever seen that I can compare it to. Free admission which is nice, and the 10 Courts of Hell exhibit is interesting, if not a bit disturbing in their depictions."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A must see attraction. We come here every time we visit Singapore. Love the mythology behind all the exhibits. It’s free to enter and also open to 9pm. Hint visit in the evening for more atmosphere. MRT stops right outside.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Educational and scenic. It is a good place to visit while in Singapore to see some of the old stories brought to life in statue form. It is also good to learn the history on the family behind Tiger Balm and the gardens they brought to the public.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa is the best place to get a brief impression of traditional Chinese cultures about religion, legend and tales in SIngapore, such as the gate of hell, Monkey King, the Eight Immortals, the Legend of Deification, the Confucius and so on. The various statues, which may be terrifying, are based on the tales with exaggerating imagination. From the introduction, you can get a glimpse of what traditional Chinese spiritual culture is.

The admission is free and it deserves your visit here if you're interested in religion, culture. But please really be prepared for the frightening sculptures, especially in gate of hell."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"An unusual place to visit in Singapore, but if you’re into temples and parks, this is an underrated place to go to.
Even though the place is a bit rusty (maybe because not a lot of people go here), you could see a lot of history in it.
I got interested in the “Ten Courts of Hell” because as per the park’s website it depicts on how a person will be punished based on the intensity of the sin/s the person committed when the person is still alive.
It’s a bit creepy so I did not share the photos inside the cave, just try to go here and check it for yourself 🧐
Admission is FREE."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Found this place accidentally, found many statue.
They have so many statue, they have a place called ""Hell"" it's quite good but scary as well. You can take many picture here. You also can feed some fish with pellet. The pellets is available here, you can buy is for 1$.
Im enjoying this place. Love it"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa, Even though called a theme park, is not your regular theme park. there are no rides or as such. but it gives you a unique experience nonetheless. there are Statue/visual Interpretations of Chinese folklore which are really interesting and fun to read. there's a path called Courts of Hell, which is really intriguing as it shows various levels of hells (like Dante's inferno) but from a Chinese folklore point of view. they also have an outpost showing other religions' point of view on Hell. Overall an amazing place to visit and spend time especially for people like me who are always interested in folklore and mythological stories."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I love tha art and painting which is very clear in pic ....and the most of it is""the story written in a board what the painting or statue actually means"""
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It's one of the stranger places of interest that has gone through random changes over the years. In simplicity it's a huge graveyard. It's also long term marketing for tiger balm.

That being said, it's very cool and historical in terms of the style of art style and relic from the 30s. Some pieces were added later (it's quite obvious) but still very cool.

The hell exhibit is normally the key exhibit that people talk about. But the whole Park is very cool"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free entrance. If you’re interested in learning through sculptures some of the Chinese culture and religion, this is a good place to start. Very nice place, a lot of history there. Chinese heritage stories and tales, lots of art, statues, water pool with tortillas and dragons."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Last times when I come here it was closed for renovation however I'm lucky this time that he has been reopened. So much fun here especially if you know those Chinese story. Adult it is not artistic but it is very unique. that is a similar Park in Hong Kong long times ago but it has been closed now. Happy to visit this place again but in Singapore this time.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A free entry themed park to teach the younger generation about good/bad, life investments and actions according to Buddhism. With the surrounding trees, the place cools you in the scorching afternoon sun. It's now also a place to commemorate the Boon brothers. It's more interesting than Gardens by The Bay."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Great way to spend a few hours. An interesting and rather peculiar place; very Singaporean. Wearing mosquito spray is an absolute mush at night.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"An amazing place. I really enjoy my time in this park. You can spend 2 hours easily. My favorite part is hell museum. I am amazed, such a beautiful place and free for public. Thanks Singapore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Haw Par Villa - formerly known as the Tiger Balm Garden – is an 8.5-hectare Asian cultural park, the last of its kind in the world. Built in 1937, Singapore’s largest outdoor art gallery is the brainchild of Aw Boon Haw, the millionaire philanthropist and marketing extraordinaire who gifted the world Tiger Balm. The eclectic park is a treasure trove of Asian culture, history, philosophy and religion – quirky yet enlightening, at the same time. Since 2015, it is managed by Journeys Pte Ltd,
an award-winning heritage specialist passionate in preserving and bringing the heritage gem to greater heights."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Fascinating place. A plethora of bizarre but beautiful sculptures, this place is great for people of all ages. You get to learn new things about Chinese culture and it's history."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Some new facilities have been added a year ago and the opening hours have now been extended to 10pm (last entry to the key attraction - the 10 courts of hell - is 9.15pm: it's about a 10 min walk from the MRT station exit; door to door). This was a an extremely good idea.

I thought that the park would have been relatively empty at night given its theme. Surprisingly it did not feel scary at all and neither was it pushy crowded.

The park also features a new (and pretty small) exhibition about the culture of death in Singapore called Hell's museum. It was very informative and well curated.

There is also a paid guided tour. I changed upon one when I was there and the guide was exhuberant and overall pretty well articulated.

The park's statues have been very well maintained given its age. I loved the style of the statues and the lush greenery within the park. It was reminiscent of the 80's and early 90's when I was growing up, when the park was an extremely popular attraction.

The brain child of the Aw brothers, whom wanted to preserve the culture of Singaporean Chinese, this place gave me a sense of peace and a clear link to the thoughts and insights from my grandparents generation. Overall, I really enjoyed my free of charge,mind rejuvenating eveningwalk in this amazing culturally informative sculpture park."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Statues and figures are well painted with vibrant colours that look really good on a sunny day and on your cameras. Although these statues have been around for decades, they still look as new as ever! The entire park is still pretty well groomed and maintained with the area being clean and older attractions being repaired and restored. Last but not least the free admission makes this place worth exploring if you have a few hours to spare. Minused one star as the place is not as big as I had expected and does not include any features promoting interaction."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"If you have time and you're around, it's nice to visit this park. Free entrance, a lot of sculptures. Although, they are all pretty weird. We have been there around 8pm Saturday, the park was almost empty 🤘 (it is open till 10pm)"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting place to have a break of maximum two hours. There, you can learn some facts about the Chinese mythology and it is appreciated that the entrance is free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting spot to visit if you're into hellish things? This place dates back many years. Expect dated decors/structures depicting hell and afterlife in Chinese folklore. Really colourful. Not an actual haunted house, more like a story-like museum. The rest of the garden is worth taking a look too though it gets really humid and it seems like a choice picnic location for foreign workers."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It's a very unique place to visit in Singapore. Lots of photo ops. Located just beside the Haw Par Villa MRT station. Lots of statues about Chinese Folklore. The ""10 Courts of Hell"" was really a different experience. It depicts the Chinese mythology about the various crimes and the punishments you get for those crimes in your after life. Overall it is very well maintained. I went there early morning at 9:30 so it was not crowded at all. Definitely worth a visit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place has been there since my childhood, and have gone thru renovation to make it more appealing. A free park with Chinese cultural meaning and beliefs. If u drive, just prepare to pay $5 for full day parking. Came in a Sunday, and observed that you can actually picnic within the compound, restroom provided. Bring your own food, cos I did not find any thing to eat over there."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"The 10 Courts of Hell was certainly very graphic but fascinating at the same time. As one of the main attractions here it was a shame to see how run down the park is beginning to look. I was fortunate to have been taken around by someone who had seen the park in its hey day and could explain what each of the exhibits meant.

This is an interesting place to see but it leaves me wondering how much better it was when it was a full on theme park"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"One of the Best Places in Singapore and as everything that it’s good in this S-hole, it will be gone soon, together with Bukit Brown, authentic Hawker centres, Palau ubin, etc. Just as it happened with the sisha bars on Arab street. Everything will get IKEAed! Hurry up before it’s too late!

And for those who posted low reviews, the 13 Chinese Hells are waiting for you! 👹🔥"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,This is a unique place. You can learn history with funny display. Could be an alternative place to visit in Singapore
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Really enjoyed this place. Very educational and a nice way to kill time. Was very impressed about the whole inspiration of building the park itself.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good place to explore. It's not terrifying at all. Quite a few stories to watch.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Brilliant, bizarre and absolutely worth going to see. Easy to spend a lot of time walking around, reading what each display represents and taking in the uniqueness of this place. Some areas looking a little tired, but lots of workmen around, so I was pleased to see they value just what this place has to offer and are fixing it up.
Well done Singapore, no-one else has anything remotely like this."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The place looked very beautiful and all the historic things were very meaningful. My family and I enjoyed it a lot.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place to hangout.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"My last visit here was about 45 years ago. It was nostalgic coming here with my son.

This is a place that is worth visiting. Entry is free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Weird   crazy but fun .   But it was free    .  @fishtaleswithtim.     - youtube
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It just so happens that as I was walking through the Garden, I saw a Read headed Japanese transfer student guy, with a tall man in black clothes and with a hat that connects with his hair...? Also there was also this Old man with a hat hanging out with them. But most bizarre of them all, I saw a Egyptian Orange coated guy fighting against a French swordsman and that was Epic. 11/10 Would come again"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Strange creatures and Chinese hell. Lots of blood and uncanny feeling. For free. Must see during stay in Singapore
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Full of strange sculptures, wired but interesting. Only few of the tourists know this place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Unforgettable journey, very cultural
Nice sculptures too!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A good place to spend your time... Lots of Chinese epics carved as statues... You can spend about 2-3 hours maximum... And ""ten courts of hell"" is a must go... But the place needs to be taken care of..."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Did you know the brand Tiger Balm? They actually built this place and the story of how the brothers who made tiger balm successful is very interesting!

If you're looking for the sculptures, don't look directly of what it means! Look deeper and there's actually whole story about it! The brothers who built these sculptures have a reason for them.. not only just to scare people.

Lastly, there isn't a villa... but it used to have one until it got demolished."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A very lovely place to go whenever you are in Singapore. It has a calming atmosphere and lots to learn about the Chinese culture. They also have fishes and turtles. You can feed them for 2$. I would definitely recommend it. It's a fun little activity.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Nice place to walk and see some asian sculptures.
Also a serene place to be alone and meditate."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This is a nice park to walk about and spend quality time with family. Its like a walk back to the 50s. Old school Chinese themed park, among the stories within park- journey to the west, Madame white snake amongst others. Ten courts of hell is a must visit within Park. Most figures paint looked refreshed recently. Park still free at time of visit. Bus stop and mrt station just outside park only main entrance, paid parking available besides entrance. Public toilets available within park."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Okay, so this place is completely off the chart. I'm rating it 5 not because of any inherent quality of execution or deep emotional impact I experienced, but out of the sheer magnitude of experience I had. I've never seen anything quite like this - the ""levels of hell"" tunnel was really something special."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting place to visit to learn about Chinese folklore thru statues and models. Much to see and learn and best of all, it is free!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,This is only referencing the Ten Courts of Hell segment as there are enough reviews for the rest of the villa.  The Ten Courts of Hell is an interesting look at Chinese after like folklore. I like that they have multilingual explanation and did not hold any punches in terms of gruesomeness.  For example the imagery of someone getting their organs sliced out was very gruesome in the backdrop of generally family friendly Singapore.  Worth a look if you are near the area but not enough of the an attraction to come all the way here for if you don't live nearby.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,Really rundown. Not worth the parking fee of $5.00 unless you intend to use it as park & ride
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It is still currently undergoing its repainting but still as interesting as ever to visit. It is such an underrated place of interest in Singapore and I feel more tourists should visit it and see the sculptures and learn about Chinese myths and legends. The most iconic part, I believe, is the 10 courts of Hell, which features all the gore and tortures that Hell uses to punish humans for their crimes. Nevertheless, it is a place most Singaporeans visit as a child and is really nostalgic to walk around in.

The entrance is free for the whole park, which is really nice, though if you plan on visiting definitely bring some water and eat before heading over. Also, bring some change to buy the fish food to feed the fishes and turtles with!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Quite long way from the city but the view is nice. Famous for their gate of hell. So tourists, check this place out !"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Spare a time to visit Haw Par Villa. It may be a bit of a rundown but the tranquil atmosphere is lovely. The classic tunes played through the speakers can give a bit of a 'down memory lane' feel and imagination in each visit. Directly accessible by bus and MRT.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Located just outside the haw par villa station (circle line), this place offers a lot about chiniese culture, history and mythology. Free entrance to this beautiful place with lots and lots of colorful sculptures. Quite an Instagram worthy place if you are an Instagrammer. The main attractions include a visit to the hell museum and 10 courts of hell.  The hell museum tells about the different views of hell from different religions. There is a small souvenir shop as well if you are a tourist here. The shop also have a drinks section where you can buy yourself water or juice or any other non àlcoholic drink. I would definitely recommend to go there once to see all the beautiful sculptures and stories about chinese culture."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Step into Haw Par Villa, if you dare. Singapore’s nightmarish theme park is a place where meticulously detailed three-dimensional dioramas depict the punishments for crimes of varying severity, from murder to reading the wrong books. This place will leave you feeling slightly terrified about what you have just seen, but it is certainly worth the trip.

Haw Par Villa was built in 1937 by the founders of Tiger Balm, designed to be a fun place to teach children about Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist mythology (though the results are less kid-friendly by today’s standards). Originally named Tiger Balm Gardens, the park was abandoned at the start of World War II, where Japanese forces eventually took control of it because of its excellent vantage point to watch ships at sea.

In the 1980s, the park saw the first steps of revitalisation. In 1986 a corporation tried to modernise the park with animatronics, which besides being even more terrifying, ended up being too expensive to complete. A few years later, the Singapore Tourism Board bought the land and restored the statues and dioramas. They changed the name of the theme park to Haw Par Villa Dragon World to recognise the original builders.

The main attraction at Haw Par Villa (and the reason for the park’s infamous reputation) is the gruesome Ten Courts of Hell. In Chinese mythology, after a person passes away they arrive in the First Court of Hell. Here, King Qinguang looks at each person’s past deeds. If they are deemed virtuous, or at least their good deeds outweigh their crimes, they are led to paradise. However, those who are deemed evil doers are sent to the Mirror of Retribution and then punished in the relevant Court.

Haw Par Villa can be reached from the Haw Par Villa MRT station on the green line. The park is open daily from 9am-6pm and admission is free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw par villa is a nice park with a lot of structures.
The best part is that the entry is free.

Go and click nice amazing pictures. Just make sure if it is too hot, carry an umbrella and keep yourself hydrated."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Really beautiful place to walk, free entrance and many things to see. Highly recommended!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It was a quiet jewel place hidden from the crowd. I went alone and was so lost in the history, the stories displayed, the display of hell, and beautifully carved statues, that I could easily spend 2-3 wonderful hours."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Followed Adventures Unlimied Meetup group to revisit place after takeover from government. Seems like the place has newly added display as well as in the process of repainting existing statues. Appreciate the efforr taken to maintain this place of heritage value.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is a great place to learn about the history of this pair of brothers who made significant contribution to the development/entertainment of Singapore. They had put Tiger Balm, a home grown product, on the world map.

The interesting (sometimes random) sculptures are what make this place special - one of the kind in the world. Based on Chinese folklore, they send the message of always doing good to others lest evil descends upon thyself.

Even though this place opens till late, do note that last entry into the popular attraction “ten courts of hell” is at 9.15pm. Do plan your time wisely! Also, certain parts of the park is not well lit at night so you may miss out on some of the sculptures which are more prominent in the day.

Admission is FREE. Have fun!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Came here with the night tour and I must say that I'm impressed with the guide, Nancy, for her enthusiasm and superb delivery. Not only was I schooled on the history of the park, I was also made to reflect on death and life."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A garden built by founder of Tiger balm - Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par depicting Chinese folklore and values. Good place to visit other than Sentosa and Gardens by the bay.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free place worth a visit during the day. But could be creepy @night
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A theme park based on Chinese mythology with many interesting stories depicted and Instagram sceneries. The ten courts to hell is a must visit when you go there. The stories there makes you wonder about death and afterlife. It's right in front of Hawpar villa MRT station. Entry free.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting place, enjoyed the statues and the insight into the folklore, stories and history. Felt like I was in a weird dream/trip for parts. Like nothing else in Singapore, worth a visit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A unique theme park with real world arts depicting various stages of hell and heaven in Chinese Buddhism.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I had a weird feeling when I was here, almost as I was part of an horror movie. This place has a lot of weird and odd figures/statues, and when I was here I was during long periods all by myself. Extremely empty and deserted. This has probably been very crowed and popular once, but not any longer. It's worth a visit, it's free entrance and it's as close to the MRT station it possible can be."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Used to be popular theme park in 1970
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free entrance. It is quite different place compared to other parks and places in Singapore. Must visit if you come nearby. Can see many interesting art works and should put more efforts on preserving these.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,It's probably fair to say that Has Paw Villa is the oddest tourist attraction on Singapore. It used to be the villa for the Tiger Balm family and then came an unsuccessful theme park. The many kitchy statues I believe are the remnants of said theme park. It's mainly focussed around Chinese folk lore and can be described as very different than what most people are used to. There are also good English translations over the park as well. A good visit for a change of pace and it's quieter here than many other places in Singapore. It's also free but lacks restaurants close by
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This isn't your typical ""theme park."" No rollercoasters, no drop zones, no scary rides or any sort. However, if you are looking for something new & thrilling, Haw Par Villa might give you that. It's a place where you can learn about Chinese mythology and folklores and understand it better. The 10 Courts of Hell is definitely a must see! I heard from the locals that a lot of them were brought to this place during their naughty days. Why? Go find it out yourself. 😉"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,So nice and beautiful places ...u can see the historical arti crafts.....
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Can't believe how easily accessible this park is, just alight at Haw Par Villa MRT Station (via Circle Line). Furthermore, it is free. Used to be a paid theme park. The exhibits looks well maintained although some do look a bit worn out. Some restoration is being done at this moment. No rides available, although, they do have tours in the morning. U can cover the whole place in just a few hours."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Very very nice park, the hell's museum is a must here."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Weird space, reflective of an eclectic set of brothers who were very open about the ways of life"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,This place is quite far from the airport but it was a free and interesting visit. I just spent an hour over there. There was no locker so I had to drag my luggage around. Its more of visual than anything else. It may be most fun if you enjoy Chinese history. For me it was just to get a feel of it and skim through it. I would recommend it only if you had the time.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place offers incredible value, its is free, acsible by bus or train, and the statues and tails were really cool, you can also feed the fishes and turtles"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Just open since circuit breaker, a nice place to walk around and learn something"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Haw Par Villa is a nice place to visit. Something different... You got to see it for yourself.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Still as great as before. Now with better facilities like more rest rooms, signages and benches. Still free entrance."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Nothing else like this in Singapore ! Haw Par Villa’s history and amazing displays are too good to miss - includes chinese folklore, deities and gods showing off Singapore’s more quirky mix of culture and heritage.
Also Grimes shot a music video here so thats cool too! Unless you’re expecting some sort of shiny disneyland..worth a visit ! 🐉 (also it’s free)"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,There are more the enough review on here to give you a rough idea what this place is about. Built by the original family of Tiger balm it was there way to give back to the community and include Chinese legends. As much as most of the stuff in the park doesn't make any sense just take it for what it is and enjoy the experience which is free. Definitely worth checking out.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"I have lots of childhood memories of this place and am very glad that it remains open for the public to visit for free.

This eccentric and ""weird"" destination brings to life many Chinese folklores in the form of colorful clay figurines big and small.

I remember learning values such as filial piety, honesty and mercy through stories as a child and visiting Haw Par Villa made these lessons more realistic.

On the other hand, I also learn to ""do good"" for fear of punishment for wrong/evil deeds in the ten courts of hell after death.

Haw Par Villa was and is still known for her depiction of scenes in hell where punishments like sawing a person in two and disembodiment are vividly displayed through clay figures.

There is a room dividing the ten courts of hell from the rest of the park that's known as the Musuem of Hell.

While the layout and presentation needed more work, this musuem has interesting information about how death is perceived in different parts of the world.

There is also a newer section with a visitor center and future site for restaurants or meeting space."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great place to learn about chinese culture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Quiet place. A gd place to know more about chinese local folk tales, legends and myths. Its free to enter. Parking at $5 per entry. Not suitable to move ard with baby pram. Whole journey shld last abt half a day. Toilets available.     Umbrella and water bottle recommended."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Such an interesting venue. Bigger than I was expecting with a bit of walking but manageable for most to get around easily in an hour or two. Some of the statues were historical, some were funny and most were just outright bizarre!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Eclectic place with various sculptures that really are from Chinese Mythology and some very weird ones! Ten courts of Hell was nice and I was quite surprised how much of Hindu culture is mixed with ancient Chinese culture!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A place of knowledge, history, tales and all...love it."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Good:

1. One of the most exotic places to visit in Singapore.
2. Excellent connectivity with MRT station and bus stand.
3. No Entry fee.
4. Visitors can see  concept of heaven and hell as per Chinese mythology.
5. Great photo ops.
6. Exhibits are well labelled / explained.

Bad:

1. Not much shelter from sun or during thunderstorms.
2. No eateries nearby."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free entrance. Not a bad place to visit in 30m-1h when you get Singapore. You can read all the tales there and remind of all the Chinese movies you watched in childhood if you are an Asian, and take tons of photos with statues there."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place full of figurines explaining Chinese folklore including the 10 levels of Hell
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's a great place being free in costly Singapore. If you don't like statues and taking funny pictures in front of it, then this isn't a place for you. Chinese theory of sins are picturized there. It was the house of founder if Tiger Balm. So, it's also known as Tiger Balm Gardens."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Iconic  attraction depicting Chinese mythology and culture. Good place to visit.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A quiet place to go for some history, mythology and learning moral values if you are tired of visiting your usual places of entertainment. Some sculptures are in a state of poor maintenance but I suppose that adds more rustic charm to the place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"Poorly maintained and two stars only for the nostalgia of having visited the place when I was young. It’s one of those places that you wonder what is the objective of the visit. You go to the zoo to see animals, you go to Haw Par to see? In the past probably, now I don’t know...it’s bad."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A must see if in Singapore, very interesting place of Chinese mythology, has explanations of each statue so you understand what it’s all about , and free entry which is great ,"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa Theme Park in Singapore has...a charm on its own. It's quite graphic, eccentric, and honestly, a bit amusing as well. The location is just right beside the station and the entrance is for free. Its depiction of the afterlife, heaven, and SG myths and legends is really bizarre.

But, perhaps none compares with its 10 Courts of Hell statuettes. Take note - it's not for the faint of heart. LOL. My bad. I went there alone. There's an exit at the left side when you reach the middle of the exhibition.

You can find yourself surrounded by depictions of blood, heart cut off, limbs sliced, bodies impaled and sliced, and a tea that makes you forget your past lives. Morbid, I know."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,What a bizarre and strange place. Totally worth the visit! You can explore dozens of weird and unique expositions based on Chinese myths and legends. Guarantee that you will be taking a lot of pictures.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Amazing!!
We can see so many statues!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Right outside Haw Par Villa MRT station and with free entry, this insane place is so bonkers I'd urge every tourist (and local!) to come visit. Crab-headed warriors, giant snakes, monkeys with rifles and naked mermaids... This weird statue park has it all!
Don't get too bogged down by the inscrutable Chinese mythic history, just come and see the grotesque statues and weird dioramas... It will definitely brighten your day!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Good place for photography. Different structures available including laughing Buddha, sumo wrestlers, etc. 'Doors of hell' in haw par villa garden closes by 6.30."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"I found my visit to Haw Par Villa a very unforgettable one into Chinese folklore, legend and mythology. It's quite an Asian cultural park. You get to glean insights into Chinese mythology many iconic dioramas. Easy to get there. Metro station is right next to the place and free entrance."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Back in the 60s , this was the place to be .. nowadays it retains its history but the audience has moved on to more exciting places, like Sentosa Island. Go here for a history lesson or to see statues impaling each other."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A must to see place in Singapore who is interested in Chinese History. Very good sculpture to be seen.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place to visit for the cultural references and the impressive statues.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It was really very long time every visit here.
So much memory, hope the management can work SMT to make this place great again.

Support support"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice and a little different place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Still active. It is Singapore's first theme park ever. Well maintained, better than last 10 years ago and free admission.

THE HISTORY OF HAW PAR VILLA

Named Tiger Balm Kings from Rangoon, the former capital of present-day Myanmar, the Haw brother over their business to Singapore in 1926 and achieved great heights.

Wie panding their business empire was important, Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par firmly believed that one should contribute to society.

In 1934, Boon Haw had a unique vision of a grand mansion and gardens for his dear brother and Haw Par Villa was born. Besides giving the best that money could buy, his noble aim was to immortalise and share the moral values behind the various meaningful Chinese legends by decorating the grounds.

Haw Par Villa opened its doors in 1937. They allowed the public to visit to preserve Chinese heritage by educating the younger generation on important lessons in life. The mansion, along with the three-dimensional sculptures and figurines were colourful, life-like and intriguing. It cost more than a million dollars to build and was packed with visitors every weekend and holiday.

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Probably the creepiest, yet most culturally significant place in Singapore. The sculptures depict scenes from ancient Chinese folk tales. The place has free admission and is open every day."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Weekend outing

Finally open.
Last went
More then 40 years ago"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Really nice place to look at and gather information =] only 4 stars since some of the art is already damaged but they are working on it so I think it'll be a five star in a view months/years
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Awesome creativity. Nice place to visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Found this place from Atlas Obscura (thanks guys!) and went to see the Buddhist Hell, which did not disappoint. Some seriously mythical creatures guard the entrance to the hellish cavern, whereupon visitors are greeted with a panoply of grizzly scenes. These dioramas represent various “levels” of hell (á la Dante) in which evil-doers are horrendously punished for various categories of ill acts. Punishments include being sawed in half, crushed by giant rocks, and thrown into a “spike tree.” While traditionally used to scare children into behaving, adults may find this an entertaining experience nonetheless.

The rest of Haw Par Villa is more peaceful. The park abounds with statues and figurines, many of which are extremely detailed and lend themselves to some story. This is a unique place and worth the stop if you’re seeking the full Singapore experience."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Quaint and somewhat terrifying place, showing interesting snippets of Chinese moral education and other Chinese legends like the Journey to the West. Has English translations on most information boards. Largely unsheltered, so do prepare sunscreen or an umbrella depending on the weather."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A very unique place to be and it's free to visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A nice garden maintained by the famous tiger balm company in Singapore. It is next to the MRT haw par villa. Quite informative actually. People who love philosophy this is for you.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A good place to see the Chinese philosophy about life, the gods and 10 courts of hell"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The place is really good if you want to explore something unconventional in Singapore. It was built by the founders of Tiger Balm. Had a good experience there.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Had low expectations coming in, but I absolutely loved the place as soon as I saw the first bizzare and comical sculptures. Would definitely recommend coming here."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Good place, unique and quite. Clean area and large parking lot in main gate."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Excellent
It's free. Good place to learn Chinese culture, a declining tourist spot"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Like something out of a crazy fever dream. Sadly, much of the park seems to have been neglected."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's free folks! Never mind that it needs a fresh coat of paint, doesn't matter at all. There's history here, very informative and engaging. Ten courts of hell is a must see. Some pieces were really graphic but it works. Tired of Sentosa? Give it a pass, spend an afternoon here and stick to the basics - knowing yourself better. Best thing it has its own MRT station, pretty convenient."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,History lover sure love it. Using status makes it one of unique theme park in the world.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,I went there last Sunday 25july still not all open 🤷but still nice
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A glorious theme park where they teach kids manners by displaying the punishments for crimes such as cheating in school and not finishing all of your food. The 10 courts and 18 levels of hell leave most locals forgetful of the creation stories and depictions of every day life which reside above and encompasses the majority of the park.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very interesting sculpture park telling about Buddhist mythology
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great free place.  I loved it.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Bring back childhood memories but 18 hell not ready
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Good places,  good garden. Near MRT station Haw Par Vila"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"To be honest I didn't have much expectations about this place,and it turned out to be even lower than what I thought.
It doesn't really have anything interesting to offer,the place is Ill maintained with respect to other places in Singapore,the idols are very childish and odd looking, definitely not worth the effort I would say ."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Lovely place for memorising old days. This is the only remaining Haw Par Villa after Hong kong's one demolished more than 10 years ago. It is a really chilhood memory for many children to experience the real ""hell"" in Chinese myth."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The sculptures make good pictures because they were all so weird and melodramatic. The place was not really crowded and tbh it feels almost spiritual and other-worldly.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Man made park, good for a short visit and to experience Chinese mythology"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting park compared to other places but need better maintenance.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Place is quite well maintained. Interesting statues and stories to be observed.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Neat place to walk around and enjoy.

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,Very happy my off day going to how par villa
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"First came here ini 2014 and second time this year, never get bored to come here. It's pleasing to come here using the bus for around 30-45 minutes from Clarke Quay while enjoying view of the SG city."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice place. The Universal Studio of People Born in the 70s
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A very interesting place i haven't been in a long time. They upgraded some places and is free entrance now. Parking is a breeze here. They even have MRT station nearby, very convenient. Worth a visit!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"With free admission, it’s ok to visit once."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's a great place to visit if you are interested in Chinese mythology. Admission is free and it's right next to Haw Par Villa MRT station.
Also fun to get a glimpse into life in the 50s, as accompanied by music from that era (creepy sounding really)
The weather can be hot so come prepared with caps, umbrellas and drinking water."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Always awesome. Not only the Underworld,  but more too"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Some sculpture need to repair but average is interesting
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"One of the oldest attractions in Singapore and its FREE. Most of the outdoor exhibits are open to public and with some of them currently in d midst of upgrade and restoration.

Haw Par Villa is one of the places that we grew up with as Singaporeans. The place was designed not to only scare ppl with the reality of the afterlife. An insight of what may await you after this life. It is actually a tribute to the Aw brothers, but i wont be emphasizing that, since you will read it up when u r there. Ok, lets continue on..

Back then, there were rides and activities for u to have fun with, BUT now closed. Not sure what incidents took place or is there defecits or even hauntings but, it was fun la eh back then...it was certainly a great place to go to with family and friends. But all is not lost as there are still exhibits that may attract your weak heart. And since we have just mentioned it, it is really not a place for the faint-hearted.

Just so that we are clear, there is also alot of climbing up stairs and slopes. This place is built with an incline and that is actually one of d attractive traits of the place. It serves to benefit u physically and mentally, readying ur body and mind.. hehehe..

For those who are driving/riding here, do note that there is a $5 parking fee.. but bikes, i shant say ah, u know what to do ah..hehehe.. d best part is that Haw Par Villa now has a train station right beside it, unlike d past, where u need to walk far to reach here.

So ya, enjoy ur time and scare yourself silly. Cheers!!

#famwithsten #hawparvilla #awbrothers #tigerbalm"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice places to visit and it's admissions is free.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Old school and nostalgia at its best. This was our Disneyland when we were kids in the 1980s. (To be sure, this is not for the faint hearted, or kids of today. Minimally-PG13 fare to be found here, what with tongues being ripped out and intestines being rolled out.)"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A place with mystical literature and story.of the Chinese Heavens and Hells.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Rustic and a place to learn traditions of older Chinese
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Founder memorial park, Chinese old old story and 10 levels of hell museum. Prepare your mineral water. No entrance fees."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A calm place to know the life after death in the Chinese way...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Best free admission park since late 80s
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A place to visit to know about Chinese tradition. Great sculptures are at display. Point of interest is the 10 courts to hell.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"So many statues here . When we came, it's a bit raining so the weather was not that hot .

They have ""Hell Museum"" . A bit scary, but might make you don't want to do anything bad anymore . 😋

You can also see ""Journey to The West"" and some other insteresting story here .

Good place for taking photos . You can spend about 2 hours to explore all things.

And it's free !"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The colorful sculptures there are meaningful and impressive.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This park is worth visiting for all the wrong reasons and that’s what makes it fun!
Built in 1937 and surviving both World Wars Haw Par Villa is well past its best and is now considered to be old fashioned.
But there is no denying the old statues are interesting and creepy as hell.
It’s free to get in and easy to get to using the underground so you’ve nothing to loose visiting."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Every statue have its own story. Interesting lesson to learn.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Lots of sculptures to take photographs with & beautiful place to have fun with your loved ones 😎
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very interesting. Enjoyed our visit.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A very good place to visit and the best thing is its Free. The nearest MRT is Haw Par Villa on circle line.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,good place to understand Chinese culture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The weirdest and most interesting place in Singapore. Good to have a Chinese buff/person with you to explain all the peculiarities...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is a really unique and bizarre theme park located in Singapore. It was built around 1937 by the Har Par brothers who made their fortune manufacturing Tiger Balm medicinal products. The park has some eerie and somewhat gaudy statues and dioraramas depicting chinese characters from folklore and mythology. I must say that these oriental statues and figurines are not in my opinion a work of art but has to be appreciated as part of Singapore's cultural heritage. Fifty years ago this park served as a means for families to bring their children here to teach the ancient Chinese folklore history. Sadly, the theme park is in need of repairs. It is still an attraction for families to visit but the dioramas and statues really does not blend in with modern Singapore. Hong Kong's Tiger Balm gardens were razed twenty something years ago and new apartment structure stands in its place. It is only a matter of time that realty development will take over this space. It is still a fascinating place to visit and the best is that it has no admission charge."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Great experience of the actual culture of Singapore, not the plastic facade of the central areas. It is not great, but it is free!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Quite on tuesday during rainy day.. Location near to MRT station, free entry"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Weird. Awesome. Surprising. Unique.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,nice place to go
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Really interesting depictions of myths, legends, and other stories. Everything is in slight disrepair, which makes the whole place seem like a setting for a post-apocalyptic movie."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"It's free, but kinda underwhelming, I suggest wait till the ten courts of hell to open"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice Place to visit.. a lot of statue and this place just renovated
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Fun place to walk through to appreciate Chinese history and culture. Interesting statues and very colourful. Would recommend as a tourist spot.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Car park available at $5 per entry.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,An odd yet engaging must-see
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Kinda sad park in Singapore. Created and funded by the creators of Tiger Balm, it is supposed to illustrate Chinese folklore,  mythology, and aspects of Confucianism, but through a strange combination of disrepair, quirky - almost humorous - implementation, (there was a miniature statue of liberty randomly placed onsite, for instance), some large buildings that look ready for functions etc looking disused and empty,  posters about the site that look like they have been there for some time advertising several positions for staff onsite in pretty much every position you can imagine,  from marketing,  function coordinator,  to gift shop host it was just.... odd.
It is featured in Singapore sites to visit lists,  and appears to occupy a fond part of the Singapore psyche and history, reading between the lines of the descriptions, user reviews, and promotional material available about the site.
You can see there has been a much grander plan with some elements having really high quality and design standards, despite some disrepair, and others that are in absolute neglect and disrepair.
There was a massive major building housing the main toilets and large sheltered area made with some expense and attention to detail in the chinese pagoda style - complete with glaze tiled roof. But elsewhere there was also a large sign describing how the terrazzo on the circular steps next to it was deliberately left in its original condition so you could see the only aspect of the original villa left onsite, which was great, except that the terrazzo steps had been overcoated with a painted terracotta coloured roof seal vinyl material. It was only in a few areas that this treatment had failed and you could see the green terrazzo peeking through it that you could figure out what was going on.
There was little information to hand to inform those of us that were not familiar with the tales that were being depicted, and those that were there gave very brief notes on the main characters and the moral of the story, rather than details of the story being displayed... there was obviously a lot more going in in the stories than what was divulged - at least in the English translations. It made it very difficult to enjoy. I imagine if you are already well schooled in confucionist tales you would get much more out of this than I did.
The display of the 10 courts of hell was good and relatable, though, with good descriptions of what was going on that made it very interesting. The pools scattered all over the park housing Terapin turtles were also lovely, and a highlight.

I didn't spot monkey, pigsy, Sandy and Tripitaca, though.... not that I expected to. Nor did I ever figure out which Chinese tale involved the statue of liberty.

Strange , quirky, full of unrealized potential, and kinda impossible to describe. It really is just full of contradictions and  juxtapositions - a real identity crisis. I really don't know what to make of it, except that it made me a little sad that a great vision has gone a bit wrong."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Nice historical themed attraction, conveniently located next to MRT station"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It is just besides Haw Par Villa MRT. Entry is free. It is shiwcase of Singapore old heritage and history. Ten courts of hell is one interseting part. It also gives info about how different cultures have defined hell. Moving ahead it depicts different learnings of life by portrying stories. There are fishes and turtles in many ponds. There are 4 memorial monuments in the name of Haw and Par brothers. At end, there is a place which tells place where the Haw par villa was before it was demolished. There is a place inside where you can get food and cold drinks but didnt go inside. All in all it is quiet, informational place, one time visit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"This was THE theme park of my childhood. Contains actual structural protrayal of stories in Chinese  folklores. However, fast forward many years later, it's a pale shadow of it's former glory. It's still worth an hour's visit to reminisce tho. Just manage your expectations."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place is a trip! Definitely a great experience, super unique here in Singapore. Culture and religion on display in statues and scenes that bring it to life. I had a great time wandering around. Cant wait to go back!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"I would not make the return trip.  My visit was somewhat enjoyable.  The entry was free, so I can't complain about that.  I could see that it is a place that holds some nostalgia for the local Singaporean.

I went in not expecting much and left not remember much.  Helpful for a brief Chinese history lesson but not the nicest place to bring kids."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Great place to visit and should be in your to see list :)
Gives a great perspective of the Chinese mythology and beliefs"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place to visit out of the ordinary. It's a bit kitsch but interesting. It depicts sculpture of Chinese mithology.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"These animals have seen some s***. Still, a historical place to learn about life, death and the afterlife."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,It’s a Disneyland for Chinese folk religion. Trippy colours and mythical creatures. Just be sure to wear some insect repellent!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Brilliant. Loads of Chinese mythical stuff if you like that sort of thing and best of all its free. Easy to get to on the M.R.T.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Went there on a super hot noon day, which was a mistake. Suggest going on a cloudy day or in the evening. Interesting figurines."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Opens till 10pm daily. Come at night for to see the place in new perspective. Loudspeakers are installed in the entire park blasting music. Not sure why, perhaps to make visitors feel at ease 😊. Lighting is slightly poor and does not focus on the attractions. I would still say the park is more worth a visit in the day.

Place has been very well maintained; everything looks freshly painted: statues, walkways and all.

No entrance fee, but parking costs $5 (cash, paid to guard and he will issue a receipt in return); parking located right at the end of Zehnder road."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice park and stories
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Mixed feelings about the place. Worth visiting, though expectations should be set accordingly to the attractions available."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,I really love it to see the craziness of the owner when he talk about goin to heaven or hell alot and he was marry with a 5 women and one of them was under 13 years old... i was shock!!! But really interesting park. You never will see something like this before
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good for morning or late afternoon walks through a place that was once a theme park offering rides and shows.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Been so many years have not enter Haw Par Villa till now bringing my kiddos and let them see the meaning of life. So much different from last time...really lucky came here since when i'm young. Good job guys keeping HPV steady and beautiful as always👍👍👍👍👍🥰
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,The tour video is too long.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A truly Singaporean heritage location!!!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,I was disappointed that after being closed for renovations a lot of the sculptures are still looking old and run down. You're not supposed to take outside food and drinks but there are no options for these inside apart from an odd snack selection from a poor shop and vending machine.  Many parts of the park are also not accessible by stroller or wheelchair. Skip it if you have limited time in the city.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Full of history from the past. Most of the areas has been refurbished and repainted to keep the history. Most icons have been moved closer together so its easier to walk around.
Carpark is $5, while the park is free of charge.
Could have been better if there is more info around the place to navigate around."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I love this place. Built by the creators of Tiger Balm quite some time ago, this Buddhist themed statue garden is filled with eccentric figures both from the Four Great Novels and just pure absurdism. Sure, you've got your Monkey King and his band of friends, but then you got crabs with woman heads and a statue of liberty near Guatama. Be sure to check out the ten courts of hell, but don't bring your kids unless they dig pits of knives and tongue removal. Very odd and satisfying way to kill a few hours."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS FROM 1 DECEMBER UNTIL 29 FEBRUARY 2019.
Only could see a few of the sculptures outside the gate."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Beautiful theme park with some good architecture, entry is free good to spend a hour or two here, one thing it can improve on is maintainance of its monuments paint has faded at many places, rest place is good."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"About Chinese religion story and folklore. Especially the world view of hell.
Free of charge."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great place to visit..not to b missed
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice place to visit. You can learn more about their old culture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,I already know this is a good place. Too bad I come in the late hour when the place is almost close. But the gate keeper is so nice he allows me to see inside for a while. Come here and enjoy the sculpture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"The place looks like it's been shut down, but I enjoyed walking around, reading the folklore, and feeding the fish and turtles."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A place with chinese culture not to be missed.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Teaches the younger generation about values n virtues. A Time Capsule of its kind.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Lovely place but needs some renovation now to bring it back to its best
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,No live performance to keep the visitors engaged
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Havent been here the last 20+ years. Brings back memories.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,So much nostalgia here! That said it's a really peculiar place to visit and you probably shouldn't bring your kids...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A park that basically one will encounter they are in a mystery land for that moment you step in. If you likes [Thrill ] & feel, go at night, they do have night tour now till 2130hrs closed. A great place to visit and away from the usual city/landscape lifestyle.
Notes: Do Respect the statues there, kindly not to climb up or any mischievous act on it."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa is not an average theme park. Limbless rats, human crabs and the Ten Courts of Hell make up this bizarre and gruesome recreation of the afterlife. Worth to visit. All showcasing Chinese Mythology. Lots to learn 👍🏻"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,One of the very few places in Singapore which has soul of it's own. Nice place to visit alone or with  family and see Asian values.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Nice places for  meory
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"One of the oldest existing cultures in the world today, Chinese history stretches back across millennia, and is filled with fascinating stories. History buffs looking to journey through the richness of Chinese tradition and religious beliefs should pay a visit to Haw Par Villa, an Asian cultural park that’s a repository of folklore and storied myths."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Well you don’t really know what to expect in the beginning and must be some sort of mental illness to visit this place. Some renovation might need but it’s a kind of unique thing to see.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Just one minute walk from MRT Haw Par Villa. Free entrance.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Good place to visit with family. This theme park has interesting statues and giant dioramas showing Chinese mythology. Has some references of tiger balm owners as well.
Good place to take kids especially."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Lovely park in the middle of Singapore.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The Oldest Themepark in Singapore which survived world war 2. Its worth to visit here to experience a bit of old Singapore.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Sri  Lankaramaya  Buddhist  Temple , St Michael  Rd"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,History of Tiger Balm.Story of the Monkey  God and 8 mortal  Crossing the Sea.Hell Gate story as well
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Place where the Tiger Balm is originated from....
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Loved the experience there. Pretty well maintained and serene surroundings. Good for a walk close to nature and to witness Chinese culture. Plus its free.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Such a cool attraction to visit at Haw Par Villa.
Worth a stop if you are in the area 😊"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"The ""journey through hell"" exhibition is quite gruesome. Might give young children (even adults) nightmares.
It is quite an interesting place, and there's also another one like that on the hills of Tai Hang in Hong Kong."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,Home of tiger balm. Entrance free
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Unique, weird, and a bit funny"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,These statues are just so weird and it's really entertaining. It's like a fever dream. I just wish that there was more of explanation on the history behind each sculpture.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Long before USS (Universal Studios Singapore) arrive upon our shores, we already had Haw Par Villa (previously known as Tiger Balm Gardens). This 77-years old Chinese mythological park was built in 1937, making it Singapore's very first, and oldest themed park to date.

There is hardly any visitors around during my visit which is a far cry from its glorious past when thousands thronged the park every weekend.

If it is of any consolation, I do see some restoration works going on with a painter touching up on the paints of some of the sculptures. I hope rumors about the park closing down is untrue. The park may be deserted but it is not in total neglect. From what I see, the place is quite well kept - the ground is free from litter, the grass are well trimmed and the sculptures, though aged, are still in good shape.

Haw Par Villa is a collective memory of many especially those born before the 1990s. Given the rich history, it would be a pity if the park is to be tear down one day. I believe more can be done by the STB like collaborating with tour agencies to include the park in their itinerary or holding special events at the venue to bring back the crowd."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"It is something from a past, old and abandoned  and you can't shake the feeling ""what a HELL I just saw"" afterwards. Weird place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Weird, quirky, and creepy...
That makes it awesome!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"One time visit place in Singapore , nothing much to do but if u believe in heaven n hell, must visit to go through the journey of hell . Some picturesome spots are there in the park . Moreover if u like to feed turtle n fishes u can drop $1 in honesty box n take one food packet situated all over the park. Lotus goddess area is looks good where I can take little rest with kids ."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Still very well maintained after so many decades. Well done!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"a lot of big statues, very near MRT station"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Very graphic and gruesome depictions of the Chinese hell. Most exhibits are under renovation or need them badly. Viewer discretion is advised (there's a sign at the gate). The whole 10 courts of hell can be done within 30 min
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,One hell of a day. Great times.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Poorly maintained turtle pond.
Unique museum on the history of Burmese-Chinese brothers and Tiger balm."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Consider joining the night walk..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Fun with kids
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Weird but interesting. If you have an hour or 2 to spare, definitely check it out"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,traditional Chinese art.  admission is free.  if you have time come take a look
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"CLOSED UNTIL 28th FEB 2019
This place looks interesting but it's shut from the beginning of December 2018 until the end of Feb 2019."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"The weirdest park I have ever been to. From gory depictions of hell, to weird statues.

The park ""Ten Courts of Hell"", specifically, made my stomach turn a bit. To be fair, though, they have a warning sign for those faint-hearted."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"PRetty cool, i like the statues over here. Plsssss appreciate this precious singapore history. There are some creepy stuff but you gotta face challenges in ur life, this is a wonderful opportunity to do so. NOt as cool as before but still pretty cool.!!>!?!?! Uwu OwO :)"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A free attraction for everyone to learn more about traditional chinese culture. The grounds were also well maintained and the modern additions lent the grounds a much needed escape from the elements.

Also, the gripping history and drama of the locale has been painstakingly pieced together by the caretakers and told to the public in a raw and real manner unlike other more staid tourist attractions in Singapore.

There are also new attractions in the process of being added, so remember to return!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,An interesting attraction to visit. Do read up the history before proceeding as it will help you understand and appreciate the history better than reading through all the explanations... And there is no fees required. Not really suitable for kids though...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Although cheesy, you can't ignore the fact that the levels of hell museum is super cool to see. The whole place is very old and historical and gives a view of the past of Singapore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Wacky, weird, wonderful - and also very peaceful. Very easy to find as it is next to the MRT station of the same name. It is free, but I would have happily paid to visit. I did buy some fish food, a bargain for the enjoyment of trying to feed the terrapins (slow to snap up the pellets) rather than the fish (fast and ferocious). The Gates of Hell were at the very end of a side path as you enter the main gate, I didn't see the sign at first."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"I saw this a part of a tour and was quite interesting seeing the 10 gates of hell but also quite creepy, I wouldn't go out my way just to see this though."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Fun and wiered artwork
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Amazing wonderful park of incredible sculptures!! Lots to see!!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting place!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,So very weird in a fantastically endearing way. Not crowded at all. Gets very hot. A great place to work out because of all the slopes and walking. Quite educational and a very good place for unconventional historical snippets and sights of SG
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Many of the figures have been totally repainted and they look as scary as they supposed to be. If you want to to visit Hell this is the place to go 😊.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice to see
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Mythical characters' statues all around in a mini themed park.......  Entry is free of cost.  Max time spent 45 minutes
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I found the place only by chance. I was there in the morning, so not many people were there. I think that no lot of tourists go to this park because there are surely other things they want to try or see during their stay.
But, if you are in SGP for a longer time, or more then just couple of days and you want to learn about the legendarium and myths, come here.

The entry is free, the park is huge, has several parts, each dedicated to a person, to a legend, myth or  a story, also with the descriptions and explanations. There is music playing all around.

I am not 100 percent sure if the visit is appropriate for small children, because some of the statues might be scary and some of them depict violence, especially the Hell part.

Overall, I spent there several hours, walking, reading the stories, checking the statues and learning."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,Old theme park located along pair panjang road. Beside the MRT station.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,I love feeding the turtles.. but there aren't any close restaurants to feed myself
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Great place to learn about Chinese culture but not at all maintained.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Amazing place, how is this free?"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good place to visit and very beautiful painting all over the park
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,Parking per entry $5. The 10 hells were closed when we went on 27th Sept 2020.  Would be better if there are some improvement
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Actually a decent place to see wacky sculptures and learn about Taoist mythologies. Some of the sculptures are a little cheeky - not ideal for the kids. Entrance is free. Can get pretty hot in the afternoons and there is limited shelter. It is a good idea to wear suncreen and bring an umbrella.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Mostly are statue of Chinese folklore, there's story behind the statue though (you can read on the board). Don't go alone, sometimes very quiet place 😁"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Frankly Speaking, this place has not change much since I last visited in maybe 5 years ago. Not sure who is really in charge of Haw Paw Villa now. A rich Heritage Places of Interest yet not much effort or money was spent to improve the place.
As it is poorly managed, please do not expect it to be in Top Condition. Many of the exhibits are OLD and has not gone through refurbishment, re painting or fixing of broken pieces. It is still somewhere worth bringing your children there to teach them Heritage and Values. FREE ADMISSION and 1min work from Haw Paw Villa MRT."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Its a very good themed park...i went on a rainy day so couldn't enjoy to the fullest must visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free visit no ticket and go here just easy, use mrt haw par villa"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"A bizarre theme park unlike any other. The park is filled with dioramas depicting fantastical scenes that are a mishmash of fantasy, horror, mythology and the stuff of bad dreams. Perhaps worth a visit for an understanding of the colourful Aw Boon Par, the entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded Tiger Balm and who created Haw Par Villa."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Weird place. Unless you are Chinese
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Pretty cool place. I was distracted by a weird french baguette guy and an egyptian guy keeps yelling silver chariot and magician red and screaming at each other with 2 japanese students and an english old man. It was truly bizzare.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very interesting although old fashioned in its representations. The explanatory signs are useful and the atmosphere is ideal to stroll in the park with children.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Beautiful park
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Awesome singapore
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The place is outdoors and sunny but there is so many stories behind what you see there it is so amazing.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Easy to get to with the train. It's free!!! Good way to spend a relaxing day. People go there and do pick nicks. It tells about Chinese legends and story through art
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"i've been there before with my parents. and in 2008, i did went to haw par villa on my own."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Unique and underrated spot in Singapore.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It is a very interesting place with a bit of history. A nice display of artistic sculptures showcasing some of the local mythology. They had closed some areas and we could not walk through them, but it was in general a nice experience."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Many thing can see there
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good place for historical journey
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Quit a good experience visiting this one time abandoned villa full of ancient statues. It would be more connect for people who know Chinese culture and  have read about it epics. Otherwise a visit here would be mere admiring the beautiful statues without knowing the stories behind them.

I was informed that the villa ownership has changed hands and thus those statues have be restored and repainted. Thus it makes a beautiful and interesting place for photography. Every session of the villa with different statues erected tell a different stories.

The landscape here is also beautiful. It is worth a visit. The only place  I did not visit was the ghost area which was close at the time of my visit.

Tour guide is also available if you need one and probably will have a more understanding of those statues."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A very good place for cultural activities. It talks about the history of the Chinese culture and many popular tales such as journey to the West. It talks about how 2 brothers help each other in their hard times. It talks about the founding of the ""tiger balm"" brand. Has a 10 worlds of hell attraction that may be scary and gory for younger viewers."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Haw Par Villa has changed over the years. It's more fun now. The 18 Level of hell constantly remind us not to do evil and be kind to people around us. Good to visit as a tourist or as a Singaporean.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great place to visit and wander around
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Iconic and historic location in Singapore. A most-visited even just for the nostalgia.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The building and the place looks a bit old as they maintained it from years way back till this date. But the attraction of the culture will never stop people from visiting. The part where you will understand about Chinese believes and cultures.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very nice place
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A piece of long ago history & myth...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Also known as Tiger Balm Gardens, there is a useful metro station though the heat of midday was overwhelming, so I kept the visit short by just seeing the startling depictions of Hell. There is good signage explaining the history of the memorial gardens and the extraordinary culture. This was top of my list for a unique experience in Singapore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Very unique experience to share with people from out of town. Most found it very strange but enjoyed the different side of Singapore. Would recommend for other locals to bring people out of town here, it is a short walk from the MRT Station."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Free entry, good place to learn about Chinese folk stories and culture. Can be quite warm as there aren't much shelter from the hot sun, so do bring an umbrella/sunglasses/hat/cap. I got some mosquito bites when I visited so you may want to bring mosquito repellent. They have vending machines selling cold drinks and water there. Carpark fee is $5 per entry with very limited lots, so I'll recommend you to come via MRT as Haw Par Villa MRT station is just 2 minutes away."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place is certainly one of a kind. If I would make a list of places to go in Singapore, Haw Par Villa sure would be on my top ten. Eclectic, artsy, gory (10 Stages in the Courts of Hell), well-landscaped, and definitely and beautifully oriental. I feel I still haven't given this place its appropriate justice with this review but YOU MUST DEFINITELY go here. Oh and one more thing, as of this moment it's dang FREE!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Haw Par Villa 虎豹別墅
A very historical place in the earlier 60's to 70's.
Free admission.

Last update May2017"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free admission, although there's not so attractive to modern people, but still can learn something about hell, place is quite clean, Good for family gathering."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free entry with a lot of interesting thing and story to read.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Nice place with nice statues. Enjoyable especially if you like to know more about Chinese beliefs such as hell, importance of filial piety and such. There's many cute terrapins too"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This was honestly an eye opener....i have heard scary stories about this place...but all of the fear vanished upon giving this place a visit....it had many chinese folklore stories that are decorated thruout this historical memorium...and guess who built it, the very owner who created tiger balm...it was super interesting especially the 10 gates to hellway...u will leave with an awareness to a near visit to yaman's territory...suggest you bring kids when they are older perhaps 7 years and above so they do learn of the punishments of chinese traditional beliefs of the various sins and reincarnations...

The older you are it is better plz to go...plz do not bring really young kids and traumatize them...and also its closes before 545pm so make sure u hit the mornings or late noon..."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,I would encourage everybody to visit this place at least once in their lifetime. Very interesting
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Lots of interesting statues and the stories behind them. Free admission.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting place with background story. The sculptures were vivid. Nice place to take pictures.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Very interesting to discover Asian folklore culture. No shops/amenities there except small gift shop with water and small snacks. Also the place is a bit deteriorated but still looks good!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I have never seen any place like this before. The art and sculptures were incredible! So much time, though, and effort went into everything here. It was so incredible and so unique"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"Revisiting after a lapse of 50 years. Good that it has been reverted to free entry after a brief attempt at Theme Park.  After all it was the original concept of the Aw brothers  (It Haw and It Par).

Was the Learning Centre for Chinese Values loosely based on Chinese cultural tales and beliefs.

For foreigners a local guide will be good. For locals parental guidance is recommended  - assuming they are older than 50."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Very original and differebt from anything i had seen before, the garden through hell is a must! Plus its free!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very nice place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice place... Free Entry
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Its $5 per entry parking. Ever since they revamp awhile ago, my 1st revisit was in 2020 w my age parents. It's always the companions u with, a great outing. Looks like there's an eatery/shop that's coming up in there. Upslope was a bit of challenge for my age mum. Everything else is fine. Can pay a $1 to the donation box provided, n u get to feed some tortises."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,This place has a lot of history. Everyone who is interested in learning about the ancient stuff should visit this place. The place is very well maintained. It was thrown open to the public in the year 1926 and has been open ever since. There is a lot of information that has been put up about the place. Do visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free entry, Interesting walk, peaceful"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"I wouldn't call it a theme park as there are no rides, but I had a good time nonetheless. I would recommend coming if you a staying nearby, but I would no go out of my way to visit

The Halls of Hell were a bit gruesome, so just be careful if you are going with small children. I was not expecting to them to be as informative as they were.

The general artwork and sculptures have seen better days, but they still had a charm to them. The artwork at the top of the hill were the best.

Bathrooms are around but often not signposted correctly."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Go for the history, stay for the craziness of what you'll see."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A different world in itself. Free entry. Innumerable statues very well maintained. A true reflection of Chinese mythology.  A must visit place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Visually appealing, free, mystical Chinese park."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Horrific statues, but in a good way. Despite being happy to pay for entry, it was free!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Historical. Nice concept. Too old and requires rejuvenation, and some basic infrastructure like functioning coffee shop"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa is a theme park that contains over 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends and history. Admission is Free!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,One of the unique and must visit museum in Singapore. A mixture of historical and conventional art. A serene and quiet environment to enjoy oneself
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,"As a Singaporean that has never been to this place in 30 years of my life, nothing is more boring than this place. It offers no strong history and culture. Moreover the place was beaten up despite being free.

It wouldn't make a difference if you went or not to be honest. This place is a hard pass for tourist. Don't waste your time."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Love this classic place.. I wish the rest of the park is ready for visit. There is some part of the park that are under renovation which are very interesting to see too. The main feature, 18 level of hell, is probably what you should never miss."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Fun, interesting and free! However, if you need to park, there is a $5 parking fee. Would recommend just taking public transport instead. You will likely spend about 1-2h there. Will suggest avoiding the mid afternoon as it was SO hot. It was fun to feed the turtles at the turtle ponds too though. And the ""10 courts of hell"" is definitely the most interesting part, though it may not be for everyone."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Most visitors aren't aware of this tourist spot. Though the snaps look very good, in real they look very ordinary. However, I must admit that the curators have done a good  job in taking  us through the culture and history of the Chinese people through the statues and paintings. Lot of effort has gone into making them look as realistic as possible. A fresh coat of paint would help it look better. The walk through hell is quite scary and little kids would be well advised to stay away from it. Well worth a visit, though."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,I love this place as you can learn more history. You can educate your kids more than 8 years old about good behaviour. Totally Recommend It.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Free entrance. If you’re interested in learning through sculptures some of the Chinese culture and religion, this is a good place to start. For me, being rather ignorant, this was a strange place to walk through. Lots of graphic sculptures, especially in the 10 hells."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Cool park filled with statues depicting stories from Chinese mythology. If you are here in Singapore for a while then stop by, but it is definitely not a must see."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Quirky.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Lots of colorful sculptures to explore. Nice to snap photos too. Get to see the different levels of Hades.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free admission. History of tiger plam, medicine business."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A very strange place. Great for photo opportunities.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Remind me of my childhood days
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Rich in Chinese Culture.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free entry.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Maybe need more insect repellent plants. There are mosquitoes

I sure missed the Dragon head at the entrance."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Really unique place. Definitely worth the visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Historical place!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Nice place to hang out but preferred the older version of it. Can be pretty hot and lots of walking so may need to prepare yourself
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great experience with this place
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Haw Par Villa is an odd assortment of illustrated Chinese myths. Each myth has a sculpture depicting the main story. However, the style and quality of the sculptures leave something to be desired. Haw Par uses concrete frames, and much of the paint is peeling off."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The gardens are currently undergoing major construction and renovation (late 2016) that won't be finished for awhile yet. So, sadly, out of towners for the next few months won't see it in all its glory. But this is really a must see ""roadside attraction"", the likes of which exists nowhere else in the world.  (The only other Tiger Balm Gardens were on Hong Kong, and closed like 20 years ago!)  It's a stunning monument to one man's attempt at teaching traditional Chinese morality to kids, in a larger-than-life way. Even adults will be hugely amused by the detail and ham-fisted morality of the giant tableaus. Totally worth a visit, but will be way better when restored to its former glories, after the renovations."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Fun free visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Important cultural site showcasing Chinese folklore and mythology. The 'ten courts of hell' section is interesting and informative, and there are many other mythical creatures and stories to explore as well.

The place is also easy to locate and get to as it is right next to the mrt station."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A place to experience traditional Chinese culture through sculptures from a bygone era.
As an attraction, you can visit the whole place in one hour.
This should be a UNESCO World Heritage site in the future. No other place can replace this anymore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Take me back to the ancient times!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place for locals and tourists to visit and without any entry fee. Good for a family time out and kids fun time
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,CLOSED FOR RENOVATION WORK
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It's amazing how detailed and unique are the statues and sculptures. And behind each of them there's a story from Chinese mythology. The villa was made by 2 brothers to teach Chinese youth the stories of the past. It has so much for children, definitely worth taking them here, adults will also be entertained. Don't be shy to feed the turtles."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Revisited the same place with a different feel  since the reopening after so many years. Brought back some of the old memories and really glad to see it reopening to the public again. Looking forward to visiting it again after most of the places are fully opened and in operation!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,I believe this place falls under the heritage category. The place has nice displays of statues from many Chinese lore. A good place to take a stroll or educate the young ones on the lore. Ohh did I mention that the place has free admission too?
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Not much around to sightsee or walk about. There are a few interesting exhibitions around, and do bring a portable fan, sunscreen and mosquito repellant during a hot day.

It is alright to dedicate about 1 hour here (though that is still quite long)"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,One of the nostalgic attraction to visit during my younger days and formerly it was free before it was commercialised and converted back to free for public. Reminiscent of the days my parents brought us there to play and understand the Chinese old adage culture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"creepy place, but still excited!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Chinese myths
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Nice place to spend your day, kids gonna like it . Those statues & history of Singapore has monument written on the stones on each of the statue. Suggest to visit in the evening 😊"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Interesting place to visit. The visitor center helps explain the history of this place and the family who created it.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Went at night expecting it to be creepy but it honestly was very disappointing. Many areas were closed at night and the many structures around the park just seemed abit.... meh. Perhaps the most fun was feeding the fish and turtles in the ponds, but I can do that anywhere."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Park showcases Chinese mythology. It is not a theme park with rides. Attraction showcases mainly statues of Chinese folk talks. Main attraction is the “Ten Courts of Hell.” Entry is free.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free, nostalgic, still go there once in a while, 18 layers of hell has educational value"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Really great place to be at. You can spend time with your family here! And friends as well! :)
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"One of free place in Singapore
Enjoyed to take pictures
Walking around
Read the history

Actually we can enjoyed

U love it"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Looking a little worse for wear but this place is weird, especially if you don't know many Chinese fables. Might have been better with a guide. Without one, just let your imagination run wild. You will be entertained, or just weirded out"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A great place to spend time with loved one and kids. Get to know all the colorful characters from ancient China
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Old memories
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Weird but educational 'theme park'. Be warned, it can get very hot as there is no shade and also no where close to buy food/drinks. We went to a Korean restaurant across the road but that was it.

I am glad I went as it was nice to see this. But you can tell it's not as popular anymore."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"I had some childhood memories of this place to be honest when families would pay to bring the entire family to visit and have a day of fun in a mythical environment complete with theme park rides for us children back then. Now it's just vastly different but I would still say it is worth a visit if one is done with the typical tourist itinerary of Gardens by the bay and Sentosa. This is something different in the sense of its history as well as the sculptures featuring lots of characters from Chinese mythical folklore. On a typical day it is going to be hot, so do be prepared with the appropriate dressing and drinks to stay hydrated."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A MUST SEE!
Great for tourists to get an insight into Chinese culture and mythology in a quirky historical park.
And I highly recommend the 10am or 4pm guided tour - really brings things to life. There’s nothing like this anywhere else!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Haw Par Vills is a time capsule
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Learn about Chinese history. The place is FOC,nice place to chill"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice place to explore in Singapore. You will enjoy the different old buildings and ruins.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"This “museum"" is a bit run down. It definitely needs some investments to bring it back to its former glory. Even the new part of the museum on the 12 stages of hell is quite run down although very interesting
The theme of the place is good though with a lot to learn about Chinese historical folklore, legends of mythology and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,This place used to be paid nice to read that it’s free now. I have a strong recollection of visiting the 10 levels of hell inside the villa. Many miniature but life like statues that can chills down your spine if you stare closely enough. It’s statues depict many important cultural stories such as “water margin” and “journey to the west.” I think it’s okay to bring your young children to learn and imagine those classic stories.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Free entrance. Well maintained. First time visit was more than 20 years a go..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Singapore has gaudy, slick, shiny but not much tacky and kitsch. That wouldn't do.
HawPar Villa is unusual in this regard and, for me, a refreshing change. The models are eccentric and charismatic. They are mostly will maintained.
The stages of hell exhibitions is a bit naff but it all adds to the charm and you do genuinely learn some Chinese lore along the way.
Go"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A surreal experience. An educational stroll around a theme park from a bygone era. Well worth the visit if you have a spare couple of hours. Easy to get to via the MRT.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,An awesome place walk through after a long time. The park contains over 1000 statue and 150 miniature. Main attraction are `ten court of hell'
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Wild, waky and shocking in places. If your not from a Chinese culture go with an open mind and embrace to messages / myths which were intended to be conveyed when it was built. A little reading before hand will help put things into context. I don't think the 18 levels of hell ( section on its own) is suitable for young children, there are models of pretty brutal stuff such as people being sawn in half and impaled in things by demons. A playground for photographers. Free entry to all areas!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,More of Chinese folklore and mythology sculptures. If you are aware of those stories you could enjoy them.. Please note.. the slope is very steep in case  if you are taking anyone in wheelchair or strollers
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Just reopened on 01 Mar 19 after some renovation. If u r driving, per entry parking of $5. Chinese Legendary Folk Tale Story. 10 Courts Of Hell is a MUST SEE. Teaches people to be good and refrain from being bad. Better to visit at 9am as the weather will be very hot from 11am. Free Entry."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A Chinese mystical world that defies all odds , standing tall and proud since its existence way back in 1937. Great venue for all ages to stroll and experience its FREE quirky randomness exhibit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Lovely statues. It is in much better shape, better maintained and more colorful as compared to my last visit to this place in 1988"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Best Historical Place in Singapore. Must visit. just near by HawparVila Mrt
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The place was so good, so many spot photos there. You can learn history behind Haw Par Villa and Chinese legend"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Not too bad if you enjoy taking photos and like chinese folk tales. There are mosquitoes though so it's good to go with insect repellent. Walking is the only way to explore the place so only come if you are prepared to walk.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Seven hell's are good, can spend 1-2 hours if have additional time, more about Chinese history"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Located at one end of Singapore. Lots of statues depicting different stories related to Buddhism. A special section depicting various scences of hell is interesting. Number of ponds having turtles and fishes. Good attraction,  especially for children."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It is worth a visit, besides being free, we can also recognize the beliefs professed by our Buddhist brothers. Many very interesting photo objects are also located directly next to the Haw Par MRT station"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"1930s mini theme park bringing to life Chinese mythology and morality tales for children. Visiting Haw Par Villa offers newcomers to Singapore one of the most unusual, unexpected and authentic insights into local culture and history on the island. Best of all, its free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice views
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,Not so much as an attraction to younger generation. But if you're someone who wants to tell your children or grandchildren old stories and of the values here is the place to go. Straight out of an old comic book. Nice place to enjoy some peace and quiet since there are no crowds.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Haw par villa looking very nice and clean and peaceful place.  Really you will enjoy that place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice to see and visit there
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A great place to learn about the history, about death, places of cemetry, etc"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Without a doubt....the greatest place in Singapore .... I go once a year to get inspired about general weirdness....if you don't like going to universal studios, and want a taste of a place that makes seemingly no sense then go here....every friend who visits Singapore gets dragged here.. and every Singaporean who ""hasn't been since they were a kid"" suffers the same fate.

Remember being disrespectful to your parents gets you violently sliced in half and nailed to burning spikes....so you will know the dangers of not doing the right thing if you come here ...

I think it's made for children...to make them behave.  But if you an over protective parent you might not want to take your kids into the ten courts of hell. I think kids should see weird and potentially terrifying things to fire up their imaginations....but that's just me!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Quirky place with free entry
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place to know about the heritage of Singapore. Also a very good place to know about the Chinese culture. These place have levels of hell and the heaven .
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting heritage site full of statues that tells Chinese folklore. Most famous one would be the depiction of the 10 courts of hell
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I discovered this place online as something unusual to do in Singapore. I was not disappointed, free entry and the sculptures were unusual and interesting. I would highly recommend it if your looking for something to do that’s free and quirky."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is a very traditional place and not a modern place of attraction. And yet it still catches the eye. Even if it is not like USS with thrilling rides, there are many interesting things like the ten courts of hell and what happens to people if they sin and things like that. It is very engaging and interesting and you should definitely pay this place a visit. Thank you."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,It was better during old time. Now youngsters don't even know what is the display all about. Could have guide or explanation.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Beautiful park 😍, filled with lovely scriptures  , lively arts"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Quite warm to go in the afternoon, overall though a nice experience"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This place has some historical stories. This place is actually belongs to two brothers who has a great interest in gardening. It is the birth place of Tiger Balm. That is why, this place is also known as Tiger Balm Gardens. It has a place called ""Ten Courts Of Hell"", which tells us what punishment we will get for some mistakes. It has many fascinating sculptures. Recently, this place has been renovated and they have added a separate building that tells us the history of the brothers. It is a good place to visit on Sunday. Remember to take an umbrella as it will be sunny."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice experience and well maintain but the carpark fee quite high.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Detailed and incredibly interesting display of Asian folk tales. Good to visit if interested in history
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good old place to visit 😉
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting place of interest in Singapore. Get you to know about Chinese culture, folklore and heritage."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Beautiful,  Nice,  Neat"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"A good place to visit if u want to know more about Chinese history, culture and some mythology"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is a wonderful place, a must to be visited place by everyone.  show the life cycle of good and bad deeds on earth and after life."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Place of interest. A bit old, but worth a visit nevertheless. The legend stays on forever."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free entrance . Worth to go in the morning or late afternoon. Bring your own drinking water as the stall just outside the villa sell water at $5 per bottle.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa  is a theme park located along Pasir Panjang Road in Singapore. The park contains over 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends, history, and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the park was a major local attraction; it is estimated that the park then welcomed at least 1 million annual visitors,and is considered as part of Singapore's cultural heritage. As of 2018, under the park operator Journeys, efforts to revitalise the park are ongoing with the holding of themed events and the planning and construction of ancillary museums."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A must visit place in Singapore.  Non touristy. Peaceful relaxing green environment. Genuine historical part not those purpose built for tourist. All locals will have fond memories of this place during their childhood. A Singapore version of ""Park Guile of Barcelona"" on a smaller scale. Best of all its free entry!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place to spend afternoon
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Timeless. Unique. A real treasure of Singapore tourism. Has been largely left alone by development (since the failure of the ill advised theme park addition in the 90s) & is all the better for it. Free entrance & a view back to simpler times.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place for the 7 levels of death principally. Also ver good for walking and reading the story and information. Spent about 1h30 there. I recommend it
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Hm.. It isn't a theme park with roller coasters. It's a park with a theme. A theme about Chinese folk tales on living, death, hell, alternate world and statues and landscapes like ponds with tortoises and fish, but they also have mini replicas of the statue of liberty and Eiffel tower somewhere. You can also learn abt tiger balm founders and see their memorial. Free entry."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"The place I went is residential area. Very quiet and looks peaceful. Everytime I return after work, I able to release my work stress the moment I get to this quiet place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"It's an interesting place to get to know more about Chinese belief and visit the so called hell. It also educate us especially the kids to do more good deeds and help people and respect the elderly. I personally like it but my kids which are 7 yrs and 10 yrs old scare and even cried when inside the 10 courts of hell. The place is not advisable if it's raining as places not shelter. The visiting hours are 9am to 7pm but the 10 courts of hell close at 6pm.
It is free admission and easily accessible via MRT. Alight at Haw Par Villa Station CC25 (Circle Line) and It's just a minute walk from the entrance to the park. Make a trip down if you have the time. You can spend about an hr and can go to Harbour Front for lunch or dinner which is about 4 stations away from Haw Par Villa station."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very nice place for sightseeing and learning the chinese culture.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"good place where ancient Chinese traditional stories are seen.
Seven hells are seen. and other chinese gods with the story depicted.
also known as the Tiger Balm Gardens,

Just one star less as the place needs some coloring and renovation"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Wonderful slice of Singaporean heritage! Great walking tours are now available and they are awesome - Friday's evening tour allows you to see the park after closing hours.  Haw Par Villa deserves to be recognized as a Singapore heritage site - do it!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"Very weird place to visit. Not sure if its good for kids or too scary for them. Its certainly interesting, but not sure I would ever go back"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Amazing historical background.  . Everyone should take the time to visit and bring it back to life
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Don't forget your sunnies
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is probably THE weirdest tourist attraction in the world. Probably every Singaporean was taken there by his/her parents in childhood to see what kind of hell is reserved for those who disobey their parents.... :)

No, seriously- if you have more than couple of days in Singapore, you MUST visit this place. Better to see it once."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"Free entry to view art depicting historical Chinese lifestyle. Rather dilapidated and hasn't seen an face lift in years.

Good to visit if you're a local or interested in Chinese history but not recommended for causal tourists.

The levels of hell is the highlight of the visit. A recommended must do while here."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Nice place.. Once you are at the top, it’s a nice and cosy place to just sit and pass time.. Enough places for kids to run around and enough statues for them to play around.. The sculptures for me is a value add to the nice place"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Full of history. Fun place to take a stroll and read up on a few ancient hinese beliefs
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good for education
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Is Singapore's one of the most visited traditional touristic place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Great for a free admission park.
A lot to look at but no food and limited drinks.
Right next to MRT station so no chance of getting lost 😂"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is not a ""theme park"". No rides no fireworks. The interesting parts are the various displays and statues depicting traditional Chinese folklore that always have a moral message behind."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"I am expecting a revamp after so many months of renovation. But it was still the same. Nevertheless, it is a good place to bring your kids to educate them on Chinese legends and culture."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"I took a lot of pictures together. There are past histories and it is really interesting to know. I particularly like the turtles and fishes on the big pond since I love animals! The mermaid statues are pretty impressive! However, some of the statues are old, thus the place might look a bit dull compared to when it was first built. The place is very serene and a great place to have a bit of fun acting silly while posing like the statue."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Legends and Folklore of the Chinese Community.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,must to visit when you in Singapore. the structure is amazing. no entrance fee. near at MRT station. every statue has their history. quiet place. you'll never regret it. promise! 😊
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Many of the statue have changed. The original version is much better. Personally felt that it delivers and brings the moral value and virtues mesaage across in a clear picture. If only can turn back the clock.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,All good except that the 10 courts of hell now is using fans. So its pretty hot in there. Well its hell anyways lol
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Traditional Chinese story theme park which just beside haw par villa mrt!
Entry are free, many statues that filled with sincerely and it is very recommended to walk around, careful the sunburn by the way.
The hell cave should have parent with the kid."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,A very unique and one of a kind tourist attraction
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Is very nice place to visit, there u know about SG last time..n many statue is showing about people before as , i love it"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Really interesting theme Park. A bit kitch for European taste but if us really enjoyable to visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"really interesting place, some parts were disturbing but it was beautiful and so interesting. spent a few hours here"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"In our pursuit of a million new ""interactive"", ""educational"", ""high-tech"", ""family-friendly"" (and invariably expensive) attractions, this unapologetically eclectic outdoor park stands out proud. Situated conveniently along the Circle Line MRT (Haw Par Villa Station), it has withstood the ravages of time, and continues to bear the vision, heart, and legacy of businessmen-philanthropists from a past Singapore.

This is a theme park without rides, stalls, queues, tents, or even entrance fees. Only its statues and dioramas tell stories from Chinese folklore, mythology, and legend, testifying to some indelible part of the  Singapore psyche rooted in real and imagined heritage (see heartmap.sg). Many students growing up in Singapore will recall being brought here on spooky cultural excursions. Some are still terrified at the prospect of walking past killer pandas and its Ten Courts of Hell, where recalcitrant humans have their worldly sins visited upon them in purgatory before they are finally deemed worthy enough to transcend. Others have had the misfortune to sightsee during the rainy season, and endured other ""visitations"" (of mosquitoes).

I remember the serene park with its sun-dappled and wheelchair-friendly slopes, terrapin and fish ponds, dew-shone Madam White Snake, and quiet conversations with companions. I was pleased to hear that a group of passionate individuals were fighting for the park's conservation and upgrading.

Recommended: sunblock/hat, umbrella/raincoat, insect repellent, walking shoes, water bottle. EZ link card if taking public transport, otherwise there is parking ($5/entry from 9am to 7pm daily)."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Entry Free park to visit. All about Chinese Gods traditional statues. Good place to take photographs. Free car park lots available
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting place where you experience a diff art form and get a glimpse of rich Chinese culture and the folklore
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Singapore tourist spot
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Historic site and love the feeding of turtles.. kids get to know our history of childhood memories
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very interesting place to bring naughty kids! Lol.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A fantastic place to learn about chimese folklore and legend.  Highly recommend a visit here.  It was very quiet when I went, spent hours wandering around the dioramas.  It is very east to get to via train.  I would definitely visit again!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,This educational journey will teach you the way of life. Gratitude and Compassion in the kind hearted will lead you to great life in heaven while hatred and violence will bring you down to hell and suffer. There sre rumors about ghosts at night but most visits in the day. No need to be scared during the day if you are not guilty of anything.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice pleasant place for reader... But very few people understand it
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,It's free admission but the place is quite messy. I do feel nostalgic visiting here again after 10s of years.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Free admission
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Different than likely anything you will ever see.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Chinese history, some construction work going on, no development in last 5 years"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great piece of Singapore history & way more authentic than the regular touristy venues
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Under repair till 28 feb
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Good place to visit with kids. I loved the ten courts of hell. Teach the kids whats not to do and so on. But it would be better if they could clean the scluptures. When I was visiting, there were some dirt within the cave and on the sculptures."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,"Visited the place during the night but was quite disappointed. There was no life and the display seems so fake and the lighting needs lots of improvement. May suggest to close it down at night. Perhaps the place is not for night visit,all the personnel might have gone home."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Singapore traditional scent can be experienced with the various cultures and literature like i.e. ' West Journey ' known as Diamond Sutra retrieval from the current India.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Great place, really fun but there are lots of bugs there, especially mosquitoes."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Cool place. It is like nature and people in harmony
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This theme park is home to a dizzying array of 1,000 sculptures and dioramas, a trip to the eclectic Haw Par Villa is not to be missed. Discover a treasure trove of Asian culture, history, philosophy and religion within Haw Par Villa's surreal landscape. For me there’s no place like this in the world"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"My favourite weird place in Singapore, it deserves more attention from tourists!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good place to visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Free entry,  weird and wonderful sculptures.  You can buy fish food ($1 for a small bag) and feed fish and turtles in the ponds."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,A very strange place in Singapore. Hard to believe that this was once a top three attraction in the city. But interesting how times have changed. Many of the stories are nicely done. Others are need more explanation.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,A unique park with various statues portraying characters in the ancient Chinese stories.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,A bit run down but still interesting to visit.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"So many funny sculptures, with information plates explaining them. Quite nice for a visit. There were many turtles, can bring greens from supermarket and have fun feeding"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"I would recommend going as a tourist, but it's quite a weird experience.
The levels of hell portion is extremely graphic (showing all the different kinds of torture each sin and hell level will be used for punishment).
It's starting to feel a little run-down overall and is probably best to visit with someone who knows about the different folks takes and myths that are portrayed. Also it's all outdoors so avoid it if it's raining."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good one.. right on the main road and walking distance from science park. Entry free and one can spend some quality time there. So I need maintenance is urgently required though.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Today Haw Par Villa is so different from yesteryear. It lost its charm and atmosphere compared to the 60s. If u r here just for photography it is still just okay
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Entry is free so if you have time it’s worth checking out. It has some bizarre statues/stories. Most statues are a bit run down but the gardens are well kept. I know there’s a lot of nostalgia with this place and for the Chinese it has some significance. My mother who grew up in China knew all the stories of the different statues. They are all stories with morals behind them. Mainly this place tells you to do good and you will be rewarded. Do bad things in life and you will see what happens to you (the ten gates of hell)
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Great moral Stories
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,a little bit old fashioned and no attractions
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Took my English friend to go see it. It still looks a bit run down, but there was a guy actively maintaining and repainting the statues there. It was not crowded. (We went on a Tuesday afternoon) Somehow you don't have to worry about wheelchair accessible parking because the parking lot is not often crowded. There are steps to see some of the sculptures - not everything you can see is wheelchair accessible.

It's well worth going to see the sculptures. It's even better if you go to their website and look at which legends are shown there, and read up on the legends and myths before you go. It gives you more context to understand what you are looking at.

As a kid, I thought it was a very large place, but it is not as big as you think. We spent about 2.5 hours walking around, taking our time to look at things. It was nice to appreciate the dioramas as an adult and not a kid who didn't understand the stories very well.

There is a small shop selling drinks, not sure if it was open though. Bring your waterbottle and mosquito repellent. If you plan to stay there a while, bring your own snacks. The nearby MRT station doesn't have a convenience store.

There is parking nearby but we took a cab. The park is open every day and is free to enter."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"What a bizarre unique place - well worth the visit. Hard to describe, but there's nowhere quite like it"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Old historic place will never fade sin I was very young visting this on numerous occation
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Can remind everyone's in life living..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This place is very interesting. It's filled with odd sculpture based on Chinese mythology, it's fascinating and strange if you are unfamiliar with the tales they are telling.

It's also free and right on the MRT so there's really no reason to miss it. Take a couple hours, and don't miss the 10 courts of hell. If you dare."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Great place. Colourful sculptures explaining cultural values and historic stories.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A very strange place
Very unique
But a lot of mosquitoes"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great attraction to experience the vibrant culture of Singapore. Immerse yourself in folklore stories through clay statues exhibited in an engaging way. Free entrance. Great park to walk around and get some fresh air
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,The theme of this place is good. It's based on start of human life and end of it from religious view. I liked the hell area of this park.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Such an interesting place. Good for catching Pokemon, if you're into that"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"For fans of Chinese Mystical journey, extraordinary dimensional illusional trip... 10am to 10pm, wow..."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I am touch by the magnanimous generosity of the Aw brothers. Visit the park and reflect  upon the brothers public mindfulness to remind us to participate in charitable acts. Although we are in a digitalized age, many decades ago, these sculptures tell us many stories. Just like Summer Palace in Beijing, how Empress Speaker stroll the long painted alleyway to decide which Chinese Opera she wanted to watch, every display at Haw Par Villa tells a story. Not so boring if one reflect upon the brothers public spiritedness. I posted a picture on Zhang Zhi Ya, fishing with no hooks. The story tells us, To Those Who is Willing, will get Hooked. Well getting Hooked for those who is Willing....Good Morale Story which apply to many generations of civilization."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Its abeautiful and historic .i was feel like to going china😄
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"A little rundown, but the information boards on Chinese stories were very interesting. Shelters are few and far between so avoid this place on very hot days.

Should you bring your kids here? That’s a parenting decision! The Ten Courts of Hell was a gruesome highlight that would likely scar the minds of young kids..."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Special location
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Fantastically tacky.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,very nice place in Singapore. really a must see
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,interesting place
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"loved this place totally, completely different theme park. This huge park’s centre of attractions are its beautiful statues depicting life’s ethics, morals and preaching of Lord BUDHDHA. Life’s journey and about the repercussions of our Deeds/ karmas."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Not too bad I suppose, definitely different from my younger days."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A quirky and interesting park, very different from the other Singaporean attractions"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I am giving this attraction a five because it is free and who can say they have been through the ten stages of hell and lived to tell about it.. the hell exhibit that is!All pretty grotesque stuff depicting impalings, beheadings, stabbings, boiling, etc that happens to less virtuous individuals.  Typical example would be the cutting off of a tongue for a verbal offense."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Good place to go when you want to know more about hell.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Historically place, with some legends and ancient story, good for weekend and holiday  walk around"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Enter this place for free; can be reach easily, just beside the MRT station. Learn the history of tiger balm from this place. Magnificient."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Really cool place.  Not overly crowded & easy to get to via MRT. There is minimal shade though, so definitely go prepared to get some sun."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Unique place to get a glimpse of chinese folklore. Best of all its free. Drink the orange juice from the machine as you get off the mrt and before you enter the park
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Go on the Heritage tour with Journeys. Its a nice walk in the morning with my colleagues!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very wonderful place
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Great place to educate people of all ages regarding Chinese folklore and legends.
There are rumours that this place is haunted but if you visited this place before you will know why.
Be sure to visit the exhibit on the 18 levels of hell."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's free to enter - nice place to visit for some history on Chinese beliefs & photo opportunity. Just don't expect to much and you'll leave happy!

Saw tons of people having picnics in there - possible idea!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Mosquitoes infested place. Stand still at a spot for 2min and you are guaranteed to be bitten by mosquitoes. Even though they do fogging, it doesn't help with the situation."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,They showcase the 10 courts of hell very interesting n informative
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice place to bring friends go free of charge
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Always great
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Used to come here a lot when I was a kid.  Brought back lots of childhood memories.
“Educational” for 18 levels of hell."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Wonderfully weird
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"If you're expecting something different and unusual, this is probably the place to come. If you're looking for fun and excitement, you're better off visiting Universal Studios. Although it may not make sense to most people, this park shows a very visual representation of the expectations of many levels of hell, and what the ""dark side"" - greed, lust, etc - looks like visually."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Somewhat off the beaten track!
Old ""theme park"" full of stone figures that depict stories from Chinese mythology. Houses the gruesome 10 Courts of Hell that depict punishments in the afterlife. Worth an educational visit. Free entrance. Go only if it's a balmy or cloudy day or early in the morning. Otgerwise it'll be very hot!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice place.should add more descriptions to the sculptures for better understanding
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Rodney as a guide was veerrryy good! Recommended visit!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Intriguing and beautiful place with historical significance. Not crowded, definitely worth a visit. Remember to bring a camera!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice old park for locals... recalled many memories n childhood. Jus a station out fm MRT. Free admission.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Such an antic place.. Lots off chinese story legend..  You can free selfie there...
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Such a weird place, it's good. I'm not sure if the run-down look is part of it, but it doesn't matter either way.

Worth a visit before it completely rots away."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Replanish done. Good to go now
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Run down and Low artistic sense. But considering it is free and is right by a train station, one can't complain too much. Not worth while for the average tourist though. More for a cultural experience/religious learning."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Dating back to 1937, this is certainly not a glitzy park..but instead one that serves to pass down traditional folklore and mythology. Known for their interesting sculptures, it will be a better experience for tourists once it has undergone its massive overhaul to restore it back to its former glory!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Brought some tourist there and they were so impressed with the Heaven and Hell gate.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A friend told us about this place and we thought that it was worth a visit.
Wow.....they were right.

Full of history and lots of weird and wonderful statues / scenes.
If you go to where the lady and her husband sell snacks,  there are lots of information boards for you to have a read of.

It gives you a breakdown of how Tiger Balm was invented.
Definitely worth a visit and it is free.

There is quite a bit of renovation works being carried out,  so you cannot visit all areas. But once l works are competed it will be even better!!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very classical place reflecting the oriental heritage.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Unique creation.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The park's theme is Buddhist based and speaks as to the journey to enlightenment of a Chinese Prince and his loyal friends Piggy and the Monkey King.  Their journey is filled with themes of loyalty, lust, greed, jealousy, etc... you know... all the stuff that still happens today."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Well maintained with free admssion. A very colorful and exciting place for children and adults. Walking among the sculptures awakes imagination!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,I feel that all those statues makes this place a bit eerie.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"If you are at all interested learning the regional history please check out this place. Found out the place I was working at had a small show room there. A close friend from there invited me to visit, he has opened his own advertising company there since. Lion statues in the harbor night mkts galour a night safari adventure historical museum on an island. This particular place was historical. Small location with lots of sky scrappers like Hong Kong. Worth your while to visit."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"The park is not well managed with a lot of construction work still ongoing. Existing sculptures almost faded if not already (except several newly built ones). Disappointingly, the renowned ten courts of hell were closed when we visited (I suppose it's under construction?)."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Nice place to visit and see some details about the Chinese folklore. Nice statues.
'Ten Courts of Hell's is the main attraction."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This is an old theme park, and so it is seldom crowded. It has an interesting history behind it (you can Google it), but it is famous for its ""Ten Courts of Hell"" section. The display is really old but is still surprisingly graphic. This is free to public so it's still worth visiting for the history and shock value."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Interesting place... so may sculptures and gardens. The ten hells was good to see. visit only if you like chinese history .
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is an absolutely must see!   Sure it's run down and far from its heyday, but it is unique and very much at risk.    The sister Gardens in Hong Kong were demolished years ago in an act of social vandalism.    The story of the har par villa, its creator and the stories within the Gardens are all equally  fascinating.    The Gardens currently don't fit the modern narrative of Singapore but one day they will be treasured as the enduring and inspiring gift that they are."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,a must see! very  good place to visit
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Nice park showing local mythology. Free entrance.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Free to visit. Would be interesting for tourists to check out one of the many aspects of Chinese culture. You can check out the whole place within 30-45 minutes.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Freaky fun. Gory figures depicting levels of hell in detailed scenes. One of the weirdest bits of Singapore
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Nice weekend walk up the steep hill. Fun feeding fishes.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Easy access between train and buses
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Such a thing would never be built now. But it is amazing - and built with a purpose: to educate and keep alive the old Chinese myths. Catch the circle line and get off at Haw Par Villa.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The reconstruction not completed yet. Anyway nice to visit this place again after 30yrs
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This is by far the most unique and weird thing in Singapore.
Built in 1937, it's a series of gardens full of statues and dioramas depicting scenes and character from Chinese mythology. One of the areas is the Ten Courts of Hell, which features gruesome and violent scenes of Hell. You might want to avoid it if you're with kids, the rest of the park is not as violent (apart from the giant battle between rabbits). Part of the park is run down and the statues are not always of very good taste ans quality, but if you're into unusual things, you should definitely check it out.
It's free, and getting there is very convenient as there's an MRT station nearby."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,An place for child to understand part of our chinese culture and way of up bringing. Do note that the place is quite hot due to the weather in singapore so drink bring a bottle a water along
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,this is a hidden gem. A must see! its different to anything ive seen in Singapore.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Free theme park, parking at $5 per entry. Chinese traditional folk tales. Educational for kids."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Got many past events. And also it's close to the mrt station,which make it easier to go there."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Surreal place. Visit in early mornings, please."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,An older attraction from the past. Kids may find it archaic but within lies stories of good Chinese/Confucian morals and values.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,As a foreigner I found this place to be pretty weird.  There is a lot of exhibits that detail (often very violent and graphic) folklore with which I am completely unfamiliar.  If you are a foreigner who is unfamiliar with Chinese folklore I would give it a miss.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A very nice and interesting place to visit. There's a lot of statues of Buddha and many other things.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Very interesting to understand Buddhism and Chinese oriented aspects. The sculptures are quite kitsch but very representative with the explanatory signs in front.
The little pb is all the FDW or other communities that do not respect the rules."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa was a major local attraction in the 1970s and 1980s. It is a place where you can depict scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends, history, and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism. It is a place where I learned how ""hell"" looks like. Although Haw Par Villa is a little run down, it is very clean."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Excellent area with much information about Chinese mythology and legends.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,It's a place of memorial and museum about death and it's classification. It very well describes what it's like to be in hell. Well maintained and depicted place. Must visit place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"More than 10years ago, I went with my biological parents and siblings to Haw Par Villa for family outing in the afternoon. It was fun seeing all the places before it closes down. I never knew It will be open again."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,haw par villa has a lot of beautiful statue..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"An absolute hidden gem in Southern Singapore, it's the only surviving place of its kind in the entire world and is an absolute must for anyone interested in Chinese culture and mythology. Despite being far from the main tourist attractions, it has its own subway stop on the Circle Line."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The terrifying place to visit when I was visited 2 years ago when I entered this place it's kind if horror place the status were dipct the unique hindusiam culture
I thought this place is kind of not cool but after that I realized this a place to visit with your family and friends  the atmosphere is calm but ratherly rains but keep a umbrella with you for safety
From this place I realize don't hurt any of others"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Very interesting place. Worth a visit for sure to take a few photos and learn about an interesting portrayal of hell
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,It was unfortunate that during my visit it was under renovation 'til the end of February. The facade really looked promising. I'd love to witness the statues depicting early Chinese Mythology.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice place to experience Chinese Culture. Thanks to the owner brothers . They donated this Villa out for free public entrance.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"My weekend activity to take my daughter to the park and spend hours there, feeding fishes and tortoises.. one of the clean and neat place in Singapore. Yeah Singapore is clean allover 😂"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Don't go on a sunny day. Good to visit during cold or cloudy day.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,good to unwind and relax... be ready to walk
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Everything you need to know about 18 levels/stages about hell.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Really scary structures inside that depicts how the 18 layers of hell in Chinese stories are present. Each structure depicts punishments worse then the next one after another level the deeper the worse it gets. Children coming here have a shock therapy and promise to do good after the encounter with evil doers being punished
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"A free attraction that isn't busy, very well maintained, a relaxed couple of hours indulging in Chinese mythology & virtues."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Place is mysterious. Since they don't charge for the visit, maintenance is not up to the mark. One should study the history & then visit. Worth visiting."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,very good place and learn alot of Chinese customs. went we no more in this world the judgement  days will tell us .
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Very interesting interpretation of the of some aspects of Chinese culture
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The last cultural centre of its kind in the world. Entrance is free. Enjoy a brief stroll on a low hill. And enjoy the beautiful sculpture depicting chinese history and cultural story.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"An underrated, historical gem of Singapore. Would recommend going in the early part of the day to stay out of the sun."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,The place is quite creepy suggest only come in the morning. The place illustrated places for after life soul.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"This place is really wacky, kitsch, odd, all those words, but still awesome. Why aren't there more religious amusement parks with plastic representations of hell? Cool history, cool place, cool dioramas."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,A great place to visit. Anyone would be mesmerized by the beautiful statues and the side stories of the Villa.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"From ancient stories of emperors all the way to Hell.
Along the way you run into a schocked ape, koalas stare at you while mermaids enjoy a spalsh of water.
Then you see the Statue of Liberty in front of a pagoda and you hear 'La Cucaracha' playing from the loudspeakers.

The perfect definition of eclectic."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nostalgic old theme park. Most Singaporeans born in 70s would have visited the park when they were young. It used to be very crowded street vendors selling their stuff at the gate. Grusome images of 10 courts of hell still scares me till this day.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,Most of the attractions are not well maintained.. free entrance but car park charges are at 5 SGD. Overall alright for stroll.. maximum time spend will be about 2 hours..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"An OK stop for 30 to 60 minutes tops, if you're in the vicinity. Otherwise not worth making your way down!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"One of the strangest and most unique tourist attractions anywhere, let alone Singapore. Built by a millionaire to teach the town folk morality lessons through statues and dioramas. A sprawling park full with colorful statues. The gates of hell where the punishments for various crimes are shown in gory detail is very striking."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Good place to explore especially the hell court.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Amazingly original-was there wth my son 25yrs ago.I love this place.Just beside mrt.
Cool..Sekeran"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Haw Par Villa  also known as Tiger Balm Gardens. It portraits the “Ten Stages of Hell” from the Chinese mythology. There are more statues of sumo wrestlers, the chinese zodiac animals, mythological beasts and dragons. It also have a small Pagoda in the center and a turtle pond. Entry free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,It is still quite nice to see everything from childhood and refurbished.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Great walking tour. With Singapore original walking tour.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Interesting
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,This place is legendary. A must go place in Singapore. But make sure you are at your best condition and dont go at night. Many claimed to observe supernatural phenomenons.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Nice place except for location. Should keep this place. I always make a point to visit it when I visit my ex-company. Now that I have quit, I do not know when I will visit again."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,You want to spend a quality time and quiet afternoon in Singapore? Haw par Villa is the place.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Interesting place to get a feel of the Asian legend and it's free. But pretty run down now.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"I love this place. Ok it's kinda crappy, but that's what makes it so much fun. Who doesn't want to see a statue of someone getting cut in half vertically or a boy getting eaten by a bear or a giant crab with a human head or a mouse with a gun? It's free and has its own subway station, why not!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Lovely artwork and park. Highly recommended
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Awesome in such a weird way!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,I hope with the recent announcement to upgrade the place don't spoil the good old culture feel of the place. And keep the entrance fee to min if required to. Tourist must visit here!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Exciting place to showcase Chinese mythology
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"So so, as per Singapore standard. However free entry. Turtles are too good."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Feels like missed opportunity. It felt abandoned. Could've done a lot more with it.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Been to this place when i was very young and boy did it scared me. Ten courts of hell used to be a boat ride. It is a lot of Chinese folklore and i believe its one of the last few places of such standing. Bring mosquito repellent and don't enter as night cause guard dogs and security roam the park. Its said the place is haunted and statues come alive at night. So try to go early morning and avoid the evening.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Old school attraction. Good for small kids to learn chinese superstition
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Pretty coll to describe buddies religion was good

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"Most Singaporeans seem to want to forget about this place, but in my opinion it is one of the few uniquely interesting  things in Singapore that isn't all labout being fancy. I love this place. If anything in Singapore should be a Unesco word heritage site, it's this quirky place."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Need to improve to attract more tourist

My last visit to Haw Par Villa is during my school day. Today I bought my 2 kids to visit Haw Par Villa. Sad to say, the place looked the same to me... there is not much changes there. Do bring along water and foods along as I don't get to see any foods or water stall inside. Do bring along an umbrella and portable fan is VERY hot walking around the place.

This place is free but not parking. It can be access by subway (door step)."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Its A Great Family Place It Represents Many Different Countries  such as Australia And America and a nice car dealer over the road we actually left haw par villa with a car!

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Easy, accesible. Nothing much to do... Im writing this for the benefits."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Great place when I was a kid in the 60's.  But now a bit run down. More must be done to make it great again.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,History !!
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A very novel experience. Haw Par Villa holds some very detailed sculptures that show stories from Chinese mythology and religion. With a sprinkling of Tiger Balm ads here and there :).

I went to see their latest addition which was the Ten Courts of Hell display. It was done up quite nicely. From the outside it looks like a tomb, one you step in, the atmosphere is pretty creepy with dim lighting and reddish hues. The model statues show off some grisly scenes of torture, punishment and mutilation, but stay within the PG-13 rating. XD

If you have some time to spare or are into Chinese occult and mythology, you'll find something to enjoy here. Entrance is free."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Pretty nice to revisit this historic place again. The status have new coat of paint, and a little renovated"

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"It's free so there is nothing stopping you from seeing it once. It's a bit odd, definitely not a theme park in a classical way, but since it's a part of the culture it's worth seeing it to understand this place a bit more"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Authentically scary Hell house is the main highlight of this Chinese folk religion theme park.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Historical and educational

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Interesting place, quite spooky. Check it out"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,There could be an audio tour with earphones.  I say this because the folklore behind the displays is more important than the displays themselves.

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Beautiful statues and such, but it is oddly disturbing statues. But then again it's meant to be! Worth a visit for sure."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice that they still maintaining this historical place of interest. Bring back lots of childhood memories.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,"The place have recently freshened up with exhibitions and performances to celebrate Halloween. The whole theme integrates the ambience of the traditional Chinese heritage site and thickened the horror factor while retaining its cultural significance. (Especially in the Eighteen Level of Hell, or ""Shibacheng Diyu"" as what the Chinese call it). Felt it was meaningful and fun at the same time."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"A must visit for Singapur, even with constructions going on, it is beautiful. Come here for a historical walk ir to relax, its for free. There is also a tour at 6:30pm(18$), where you have a guide which covers the history and a the setting is a bit more with ambient lightning."

The same twin garden in Hong Kong is already closed, so please be treasure to this one."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Few spots are closed by 7 PM .. failed to understand why in Singapore such restrictions are there because of the lights are not available in those places ..  also the story of the sculptures should be in detail .. over all good go before 5 pm ..
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,Feels a bit dated but still a unique spot to visit

While some of the color has probably been warn down over the years but they are still very vibrant! The 10 courts of Hell area is so cool! It was a little difficult to navigate and even though you can still enter after 5:30 pm, the guest center was closed. I wish there were pamphlets or brochures in the front area so I could have figured it out... I guess I missed a pond somewhere? Anyway, it was super cool, a little off the beaten path/ further to get to but worth It!"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"This park has potential to be awesome. Too bad it seems lack of maintenance, make the park seems quite dirty. There are a lot of broken and damaged statue. Some statue are awesome, but there are some that was not good designed. The good part is the 10 level of hell building make us to understand about the chinese culture about their believe in heaven and hell. This park is recommended if you love chinese culture, as it's free"

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"The place was very rundown. The stories were interesting but a lot of the sculptures were so beat up that they were getting repainted and retouched. A lot of people there were disrespectful and climbing all over the sculptures when signs clearly asked patrons to avoid doing just that. Multiple workers walked by them and did not say a word. They could have a stood up for their place of employment and culture. The 10 stages of hell is not very kid friendly, and they state so right before you enter that portion."

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,hasn't changed much and realy enjoyed the pm with friends who hadnt been for years
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Haw Par Villa had an extraordinary history and through the change in ownerships, a lot of changes by way of renovations and refurbishments.
The theme park had a lot of ambitions initially but failed to deliver due to lack of funding for its renovations in the early 90s. I'll leave the history for your own reading which you can search online but the current place is still wonderful to visit.
It was to depict the Chinese myths on the tribulations of what happens when you do good or commit sins in this life. The attraction has to be how the gory punishments are being carried out in the 18 levels of hell.
It can be rather haunting and I'll recommend against bringing little children in unless huh have every intent of giving them nightmares for the next few nights, it can be frightening.
Otherwise it's a rather nice place to visit especially if you're visiting Singapore because you really don't get to see anything like it anywhere else in the world.
Just try to read up more on the history before visiting so you'll be able to enjoy the visit more."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice place n free entry n click pics n have some time spend with love ones
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"Place needs more maintenance, it could be an interesting outing if the story/description panes are better maintained. Some figurines are not suitable for kids"

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Nice place to walk around for an hour, and to revisit my childhood a little, but I probably won't be heading back for a while"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"Was fine, interesting to understand some about Chinese culture and religion, better go before 5pm to see everything, at 5:40 they start to close some of the exhibitions."
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Nice
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"If you are interested in knowing the Chinese mythology you will probably like it. You will easily see the entire place in an hour's time. it also houses the ten chambers of hell depicting various punishments for different sins you have committed. It's hard not to notice that the Chinese belief system holds close resemblance to that held by the Hindus that your sufferings/ happiness in the next life depends on your doing in the current life. The re-birth and escape from it is all there.
Some of the depictions are gory... Not a well maintained place sadly"
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,The best theme park is a Free theme park. What more can you expect.
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,Also called tiger balm gardens. Constructed by owners of tiger balm company. A cool little park with lot of chinese statues representing their stories and beliefs.

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,5,Educate your kids on some Chinese moral values
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,3,"It's interesting if you like stories alot or taking stroll. The walk can be challenging at the beginning of the slope and with how some of the stairways are set up, so be sure to have someone ready to look after young children or elderly people at the bottom of the attraction if you plan to visit on a really hot day. Alternatively, you can seek temporary reprieve against harsh elements by walking halfway up the slope where there is a Visitor Centre to rest your feet. There is no eatery, just snacks and drinks' vending machines costing about 1.20 SGD onwards. (There are some affordable food establishments across the street but you need to consult with Google Map and check on their operating hours.) Best if you are accompanied with on this sightseeing trip. Equip with a cap or a brolly whenever is possible, wear breathable clothings and travel light."

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,1,Total joke. Waste of time
Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,2,"The park, originally called Tiger Balm Gardens, was built in 1937 by the Burmese-Chinese brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the developers of Tiger Balm, as a venue for teaching traditional Chinese values. They moved their business from Burma to Singapore in 1926 and purchased the site in 1935.
In 1986 the International Theme Parks Pte Ltd, announced an investment of $30 million to modernise the themed park. This company was a joint venture formed by Fraser & Neave and Times Publishing, and had invested on the latest animatronics and technology to enhance the attractions in hope to create an 'oriental Disneyland', a theme park meeting Western technology with Eastern mythology.[1]
In 1988, the Singapore Tourism Board took charge of the Tiger Balm Gardens and renamed it ""Haw Par Villa Dragon World"". The Haw Par in the park's name is based on the Aw brothers' personal names—Haw and Par, which mean ""tiger"" and ""leopard"" respectively. The dioramas and statues were restored, while plays, acrobatic displays and puppet shows were organised and held there. The management imposed entrance fees but the high fees discouraged visitors, so the management incurred a loss of S$31.5 million over 10 years. The park management made a profit during its first year of operations after renovations in 1994, broke even in 1995, but started incurring losses over the next three years and was forced to provide free entry in 1998. In March 2001, the Singapore Tourism Board renamed it ""Tiger Balm Gardens"".[2] The park is now open every day from 9 am to 7 pm (with last entry at 6 pm) and admission is free.
In 2014, artists Chun Kai Qun, Chun Kaifeng and Elizabeth Gan, under the curatorial platform Latent Spaces, staged four exhibitions in the theme park's unused spaces. Their first exhibition, Nameless Forms, featured the works by the Chun twins, Darren Tesar, Sai Hua Kuan and collective Yunrubin, which respond to the place’s defunct exhibition halls, idle pavilions and the materials that were left behind."

Haw Par Villa: Singapore Theme Park,4,"This can be considered the earliest theme park in Singapore history.

This villa which opens to public is filled with many stone statues and giant dioramas depicting scenes from Chinese mynthology, folklore, legends, history and illustrations of various aspects of Confusianism.

One of the main attractions is the dioramas depicting the 10 levels of Hell in accordance to the Chinese beliefs.

Originally known as Tiger Balm Garders, this villa was built in 1937.  It has gone through numerous rounds of renovations and maintenance works to preserve these statues and dioramas.

The slope that streches into the villa is rather steep thus not very wheelchair friendly.

There is no restaurant or stalls selling food and beverage, except some vending machines selling cold drinks are available. So better prepare some food like sandwiches if you intend to stay here over a few hours.

There is one souvenir stall inside the villa.

There are limited shelters in this villa so make sure you are prepared for sun and rain."

And of course, it's always recommended to be mindful of one's surroundings, especially with valuable artifacts around.

The house was bought by the government when the family left Singapore
The rehabilitation is very well done, although there are things that are not so old
They give you a little explanation to learn more about the ancient history
They do not allow to take interior pictures, the truth is that I do not see a logical reason ..
I must emphasize in negative, that the only language in both the explanatory brochures and the guide is English or Mandarin, it seems that there is no other language.

Hong San See Temple Singapore,4,It's a small temple which can be explored within 30 minutes unless you care to examine the intricate carvings. However it looks majestic from afar. I prefer exploring Lian Shan Shuang Lin though.
Hong San See Temple Singapore,5,What made this so worthwhile was the tenants’ friendly and welcoming demeanor. They were very happy to explain the temple’s history and even offered us free water as it was very hot that day. We made a small donation to show our appreciation. Probably not a “must see” in Singapore but a very pleasant and memorable experience.
Hong San See Temple Singapore,1,Inconsiderate management of the temple. Starting the music before 830am and setting up unmonitored fires creating bad haze for the condos around. Poor families with little kids or eldery with respiratory problems who live around.
Hong San See Temple Singapore,5,What is the main God? Anyone know?
Hong San See Temple Singapore,5,I have lived next to this temple for a number of years and decide to go pay a visit a few months back. The temple is situated on the side of the hill between 4 new condos... after climbing the steps leading up to the temple you are treated to a beautiful old temple with intricate designs which is a haven of peace.  The staff are always welcoming and i love the different perspectives / view points that we never get a chance to appreciate..
Hong San See Temple Singapore,5,Beautiful temple and extremely friendly and accommodating staff! Thank you for your hospitality!

Hong San See Temple Singapore,5,"Hong San See (Chinese: 凤山寺; pinyin: Fèngshān sì; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hōng-suann-sī) is a Chinese temple in Singapore, and is located at Mohamed Sultan Road in the River Valley Planning Area, within the Central Area.

Hong San See Temple was constructed between 1908 and 1913, erected by migrants from Nan An County in Fujian province with materials imported from China. One of the builders was Neo Jin Quee (Chinese: 梁壬癸; pinyin: Liáng Rénguǐ), an early Chinese pioneer and leader from Nan An County. Built on a small hill, the temple once overlooked the sea. The temple's vicinity now mainly houses bars, restaurants and expensive apartments.

Singapore Lam Ann Association manages the temple.

The original temple to Guangze Zunwang (广泽尊王) was built in 1836 on Mount Wallich in Tanjong Pagar, and was erected by migrants from Nan An county in Fujian province of China. In 1907, the land was acquired by the government for reclaiming Telok Ayer Bay and the temple trustees were given compensationof $50,000. The temple trustees used the money to buy land on a 999-year lease on Mohamed Sultan Road from Sam Tomlimsonwho was the Municipal Engineer."

Esplanade Theatre,4,I went to this place as part of my 5 days trip to Singapore in May 2019. This is inside Garden by the bay. I nice mall and they have light music show in the evening around 7 PM I guess. Nice to and go and witness the same
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Had a great opportunity to perfom here with my other music buddy last week with Dapur Smooth Jazz Trio. Esplanade is really know what they're doing as they have professional team. Great, helpful and friendly team work that we're always grateful for. Practice hygiene by maintaining safe distance measurement for the audience by giving max number of 50 per session, cleaning the sitting area during the break so both the performer and the audience will feel safe to enjoy the music performance. Thank you and God bless Singapore!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"I'm reviewing on the halls instead of the whole esplanade itself. Honestly I didn't expect the grandeur of this scale as I thought it was more of a stage setting having watched 1 or 2 plays at this location. This time round I attended a piano recital piece, and I was in awe of the setting."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Iconic landmark. The theatres are not open now but from past experiences, its clean. Now not a lot of people since have covid but the place has good vibes to go do some drinking. Theres a library there for you to study as well."

Esplanade Theatre,5,"An incredible venue, right in the heart of the city. Next to beautiful views of Central Business District and the Marina. Esplanade in itself is a beautiful building and becomes the backdrop to so many touristic photos.
The concert and Theater halls are world class and the best in Singapore. There are many shops, cafes and restaurants at this venue, making it a very practical and complete venue.
There is also an outdoor theater next to the water, which creates such a beautiful atmosphere. There are always different cultural or arts showcases going on in Esplanade.
Very big parking space, means that even if more than one concert is happening at the same time, you will always find parking right at the venue and will not have to go looking for parking in other areas. Highly recognizable venue, especially as the Formula One race happens around this venue."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"One of iconic place at Singapore,
Some big hall to perform art and gallery"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Emails were sent out to inform of closure of parts of the underpass. Trace together links were also sent beforehand so that all tracing and check in was smooth sailing.  Usherers were very clear with instructions and directions.
Esplanade Theatre,4,I normally visit the library at Esplanade rather than catch art/cultural performances. Love the collection of DVDs!
Esplanade Theatre,4,Very nice walkway along the waterfront. If you don't want to take one of the river/harbour cruises you can still get awesome views of the waterfront walking along the Esplanade. The local hawker center was closed when I was here but was supposed to be open again by December. There is a small mall nearby with bunch of restaurants if you need to stop. The walkway continues all the way around to the hellix bridge & over to the marina bay sands.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Being a musician, Esplanade is a place close to my heart. It's known as #MyDurian, an iconic building that all will recognise the moment they see it.

It's a place to promote musicians, bands, symphonies, choir for performance. It also hold regular free concerts for us to attend.

There's also library at the 3rd level where you can borrow many musical scores, CDs, books with a specialisation on music education.

There's also some shops which sells musical instruments as well as creative products that are made by Local Companies. The cafes, restaurants offers a good variety of mix of both local and other cultural delights.

To take a look of the Esplanade, you would like to go to Esplanade Bridge. It's especially beautiful at night.

#ILoveEsplanade"
Esplanade Theatre,3,"Our national performing arts centre at the Esplanade with a lovely view of the Marina Bay in front of the theater complex. There's music and dance performance and visual arts exhibitions going on the Theaters on the Bay throughout the year. . . about 3,500 over programmes."
Esplanade Theatre,5,When there for toilet and taxi stand. 5 stars!
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Never really been inside the actual theatre for performances but based on location and scenery from the outside, it's amazing. Situated directly beside the marina and across the Merlion, it would be a great place for those who love photography. Shaped and sculptured alike to a durian, it is a refreshing view for those who've yet to see it in real life."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Iconic building of Singapore. A must-have photo for your travels.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed the evening here.  There was a series of performance that evening featuring The Tapestry of Music - tribal dance and musical instruments.  We were seated right opposite the event for dinner.
A great place to hang out, dinner and chat with friends.

We walked here from Chijmes through Raffles City!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Convenient access, beautiful arts and music performance"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice View! Near Merlion Park..
Esplanade Theatre,4,"This is where you can find the artistic side of Singapore.  The bold architecture shaped like  2 durians or some said looks like eyes of a fly, had in the beginning attracted lots of critics but they looked great upon completion; blending well with the landscape.  There are lots of performances on weekend to inspire the young ones."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Excellent facilities!   I enjoyed every theatre and concert that I have experienced in Esplanade there. It provides good stages for performers and goods environment for audiences.

Lots of shops, free or paid exhibitions or shows at the Art Science Museum. There is a wonderful public library with books and resources specialising in the performing arts. Strolling around the water front to study the skyscrapers on the other side at Boat Quay or marvel at the fun architecture of the MBS hotel, the Art Science Museum and the Esplanade Theatre. Take lots of photos!"
Esplanade Theatre,4,It’s been some time since I got this close to the esplanade. What a impressive structure! Really well-designed.

Esplanade Theatre,5,Best venue to spend your evening in Singapore. There is a light and water show with the beautiful symphony nearby Marina Bay Sands.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Multiple venues for live performances of all genres and media.

Beyond the iconic twin durian domes, Esplanade has a number of other performance venues.

I have seen several performances at the Annexe Studio, most of them theatre or performance works made by local artists, arts collectives, and theatre companies. The air-conditioned Studio is spacious and flexible, accommodating a variety of performance types. In addition to live music, it’s a great place to catch works-in-progress by local artists, though it also hosts final productions by both traveling and Singaporean art-makers.

The Outdoor Theatre, which faces the equally iconic MBS complex, also hosts daily performances in a range of genres and media. Many of them are free and open to the public, and feature world-class local and international acts."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"A country worth visiting.  Safe, clean, highly educated, beautiful scenery, friendly people.  It is necessary to study Singapore on how the government works."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautiful place
Esplanade Theatre,5,"A world class theatre that offers variety of seating and halls/rooms. The main concert hall has a somewhat greater acoustic treatment than the Malaysia Philharmonic Hall at KLCC.

The bar serves beverages and snacks during intermission, with a beautiful view overlooking the Marina Bay and Singapore skyline. A great experience if you have a show in the evening."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Esplanade or some called it Gedung Duren, shaped like Durian Fruit is one of the best mall / photo spots in SG before MBS was built.
Located just around merlion park - helix bridge, MBS and raffles place its a must visited place in SG"
Esplanade Theatre,4,"A pleasant place by the waterfront for food and art. The shops on the ground floor are a bit sad and empty but hopefully the recovering economy will help visitor numbers. As of Jan '21, parking is free at the Esplanade between 12-3pm and 6-10pm."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautiful please for site seeing. Just beside this there were a sea food court great taste enjoyed this place.👍👍👍

Esplanade Theatre,5,"Theatres on the Bay (also known as the Esplanade Theatres or simply The Esplanade) is a performing arts centre located in Downtown Core near the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the nearby Esplanade Park, it consists of a concert hall which seats about 1,600 and a theatre with a capacity of about 2,000 for the performing arts."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"The Esplanade is a waterfront location just north of the mouth of the Singapore River in downtown Singapore. It is primarily occupied by the Esplanade Park, and was the venue for one of Singapore's largest congregation of satay outlets until their relocation to Clarke Quay as a result of the construction of a major performance arts venue, the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, which took its name from this location.

Apart from the shows, Singaporeans usually visit the Esplanade for its scenic outdoor view. It overlooks the Singapore river and is in between the Singapore Flyer and Merlion park, making for a good stroll around the vicinity. River ferries stops have been added recently, enhancing its accessibility"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"The ultimate go-to place to catch a diverse range of dance, music and theatre performances in Singapore! As the national performing arts centre, the eye-catching, boldly designed architecture of Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay resembles that of the durian, a much loved fruit in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. Especially lively and vibrant environment on Friday and weekends!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Esplanade - Theatres on the bay has a well known special architecture that looks like a durian because of the spikes. Definitely a place for those who are into musics, performing arts and theatres. Sometimes, there is free performances, both indoors or outdoors. Besides being an art performing base, it is also a small mall with a few restaurants, arts related shops and a library located on third level."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Love the monthly free activity such as free concert! Have to queue 1 hours before to guarantee the seat is front of the stage. Great show & environment.

Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is a fantastic spot to watch the beautiful Singapore skyline. Amazing small shops and restaurants and the waterfront. It was a little rainy when I was there but the view was still breathtaking. Definitely visit this place and the whole of Suntec city, if you want to spend some quality time watching the skyline, enjoying great food and shopping. The Singapore free tour bus from Changi stops here. Highly recommended."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Very Very nice view. Will continue seek and find more beautiful place around this area.

Esplanade Theatre,4,"An iconic must-visit place in Singapore. The water mass was once a river but now becomes a dam. Surrounding this water mass is the financial district of Shenton Way housing many tall buildings and landmarks on one side. Most prominent is the Fullerton Hotel which was once the Singapore General Post Office. The building is more than 100 years old. The very intagrammable Merlion Statue is just across the hotel where there is an endless crowds of tourists and locals taking pictures and sharing it with the world. On the other side of the water is the famous Marina Sands Casino with the Helix bridge beside it. In it, you have the casino shopping center and many local and foreign F and B establishments. And not forgetting another icon, the Esplanade theater, more popularly known as the Theatres on the Bay. The locals called it the Durian because the spiky roof looks like a durian fruit. It's a wonderful place to take some stunning pictures of the bay and it's also a place where you sit and sip coffee and watch many bumboats go by carrying the millions of tourists every year. The night scene is simply stunning."

Esplanade Theatre,5,"2 adults, a toddler and a 4 years old girl went to the open air theater located by the river side.

It's an African drum performance and it's free and open to public. No need collect tickets or make reservation, we just went there 20mins earlier before the show begins and choose our seat.

The show was good and the theater sound & lights were good. Our girls enjoyed the 45mins show without making any complain.

The night scenery was fantastic too. Along the river side, there were many stalls selling food and drinks. Toilets are open to public too.

Esplanade Theatre,4,"Esplanade- Theatres on the Bay remains one of the most intriguing space on this sunny island 🇸🇬
When the building model was first unveiled to the public, some thought it resembles insect eyes. Of course some of us are food crazy locals who prefer to associate it with durians.
Yet the architect originally depict it as a pair of microphones (aerial view).
🎨 Art is very much open to interpretation, and re-interpretation. Often, there is no absolute answers, just like life itself."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay is a performing arts centre located in Downtown near the Singapore River. it consists of a concert hall and showcases a number of free exhibitions in relation to performing arts. It's also worth checking on what is showing in the theatre and attending one of the performances. We unfortunately didn't have time but took a walk around the place and checked out the 'Game of life' exhibition.

Thereafter you can walk down towards the Singapore River for an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands (Picture in this review). We managed to catch the 9pm light show from the riverside and it was beautiful. You can even walk down the river and get to Merlion Park. An excellent way to cover majority of the sites."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"SUPERB service and friendly staff! Enjoyed my Star Wars Film Concert thoroughly. The staff (an uncle in his 60s-70s?) helped us a lot, as for some unknown reason, we got the same seats as another patron!

He gave us a foyer stall to sit after we were confused and didn't know what to do."

I have personally never eaten there but they do have restaurants and Seven Eleven should it come down to it. A wonderful place to stroll around and get lost in though and a fee rare novelty shops to visit. There is occasionally, when there is a free exhibition, the 'Tunnel' which is located below the esplanade that leads to the mrt which can be asily missed if you arent taking the mrt to go to or from. Would recommend to go relatively before 12pm to stroll around to view the exhibitions that are free and even outside, and if it is in the budget watch something in the evening or night."

(Fullerton Five Star Hotel now) you can see from afar a big U shape. A place for eating. There was a Stay Club at the end, Noddle Stall, other Food Stalls and also drink Stall. They have Square shining tables and chairs very light to carry. We all have our dinner under the stars. We can see the ships far from our shore. There were many small bum boats near Clifford Pier. After our meal we took a slow walk at Queen Elizabeth walk again and than we go home."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Just visited recently to check out their Flipside Festival 2018 and there are plenty of activities and performances to immerse yourself into, especially on weeknights and weekends.

Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great experience, great place, great show!!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"I had so much fun watching the free performances here! At the first night on Friday there was a 古箏 performance and on Saturday there was a chore singing Western classics.  With the cultural sphere these great and free performances create, no doubt Singapore is a culture hub of Southeast Asia.

The intention of building a permanent semi-outdoor theatre for performances here is remarkable. In my home city of Hong Kong, there is unfortunately no such thing in the cultural centre. When there's need for performance, they just build a temporary one. Singaporeans should be proud of their culture standing in the region. If I'm a Singaporean, no doubt I'll be a frequent visitor of this place!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Excellent concert place. Note that there is no mobile signal inside.

Details are available online as well, so you can choose the ones you want to attend. Esplanade has various areas where they conduct these shows, namely the concourse, annexe studio, arena, powerhouse etc. A nice way to spend evenings when you have nothing better to do. Do plan accordingly, as a huge crowd always gathers to enjoy these shows, if you want a seat, come in early. But it is acceptable to stand around and watch too. Do give it a try.👍"

Esplanade Theatre,5,"Esplanade theatres on the bay may draw people because of its architecture significance and its proximity to the marina Bay Area but the purpose it embodies is what truly astonish. With more than 50% of the shows free to public, Esplanade is to make art accessible to the public. Come grab a sandwich during lunch and watch a live guitar ensemble for free. Just look for the monthly program highlights online.

How does the P&L work out for Esplanade in the marina Bay Area of Singapore, the most premium strip of real estate in the most expensive country in the world?

It doesn’t. The entire Esplanade theatre by the bay is a charity organization. What is free may not mean it did not cost (another dearly).

Qn: What is costing you dearly that you have now made free and accessible for others? #esplanade"
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Nice  location with  awesome  auditorium, very  clean and  nice  . Lots  of  places  to  take  a  quick bite. Fully  air condition with clean restrooms  that  too free.

There you see a lots of art shops and a small walking distance further on a hawker food centre and some restaurants, absolutely unexpected and surprising.There is no need to come here for concerts or theatres only.

The weekends of free events, both in the indoor atrium area, and their outdoor venues make a trip to this area a welcome event each weekend of the year. Food choices are plentiful so if you want to grab dinner and a show, often free ones, it is a very good option."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Free performances galore! Check out the latest schedule!
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Excellent theatre with quality performances all the time. But what's even more impressive is the view outside of it that overlooks the Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely STUNNING!

Esplanade Theatre,5,Check out their website for free performances to watch (both indoors and outdoors).
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Great music hall, a lot of art stuff here to look at, has some displays now and then, shows and concerts are nice and has good security.
Underground passage connecting Esplanade, Esplanade MRT and Marina Square is also very useful but could be confusing to free and easy tourists as the underpass completely replaces the traffic lights at the cross junction on ground floor."

Esplanade Theatre,4,I was here recently watching local music in the even g it was a really nice chilled place to be and the music was fantastic
Esplanade Theatre,5,"I like the scene here. Its touristic, its clean and quiet except of course when its not 😂. It can be packed during performances of course or simply during the weekends and holidays.  There are benches everywhere or day beds on the other end where you can just sit, relax and enjoy the wind on your face or you can also stroll, sightsee and people-watch. Locals, expats and tourists alike jog, cycle or bring their PMDs along the esplanade, it is very spacious and in some areas are designated lanes for bicycles. There are PMDs and bicycle rentals available in designated areas, you can simply download the app sign up and it will show you where u can pick up and drop off these PMDs. You can also visit the malls, coffee shops, restaurants and museum along the esplanade. You can have a whole entire day worth of activities depending on how you budget your time at this place."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"The Esplanade most visibly spotted with it's durain thorn-like twin domes. The thorns were not part of the initial design but an later-add on to defect the sunlight acting as sunshades.

I have been to a few ballet performances held at the Esplanade and the experience is nothing short of being wonderful. The place is beautiful, comfortable with excellent acoustically designed performance spaces.

Within the building, sometimes there open exhibitions which one can visit without the need for a ticket.

There is a performing space just outside the Esplanade where events were held and is popular among the local and overseas crowds.

There's some nice restaurants in the buildings with excellent views. If you are in the area, do drop by. The walking path is also filled with beautiful views."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Our very own cultural showcase.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Beautiful scenery all around. But the 2 main gated attractions are too expensive.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Favorite local performance arts house

Esplanade Theatre,5,"Went to the Recital Studio for a concert and was pleasantly surprised by how big the location was. While waiting for the venue to open for seating, we went to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Again, we surprised that the environment was nice despite it being a Sunday. I would recommend spending some time to have a meal if you happen to be there for a concert."
Esplanade Theatre,5,World class performing venue with a view. Great sounding accoustics for an open air venue. Best part is its free! Its truly arts for the masses.

Esplanade Theatre,4,A good place to appreciate art and culture
Esplanade Theatre,4,"This used to be the place to go for the hottest shows and acts in Singapore.  However in the last couple of years, it has been the Theatre at Marina Bay that has bringing all the acts.  The Esplanade is now left with fringe acts and Ballets.  As a Theatre, I like it better.  It is much easier to park and an easier place to get too."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Always enjoyed the atmosphere from around and within the Esplanade. Especially loved the performances they hold at the atrium space indoors and the live bands facing the bay area.
Great acoustics too! Attractive and interesting shops on ground level. Just wishing there was space for more.
Performance halls are also well designed with unobstructed views and acoustics.
Lots of car parking space to ensure you'll get a lot on performance nights."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Free venue. Watched Hoodwinked at ""Bands we grew up with"" in May.
They were good cover artists. If you want accurate copy they were not. But their interpretation was hugely entertaining. The venue itself is outdoor, covered and fixed banked seating. Great free entertainment in Singapore."

Esplanade Theatre,5,Very cozy to hang out with
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Nestled in the middle of the city and tourist area, the ampitheatre is an excellent hub for musical talents that is imported to Singapore. My only comment is the foot traffic of people constantly walking around the public performance distracts us from the great local talent presented on stage."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice place to chillz

Esplanade Theatre,5,"Excellent outdoor performance, highly recommended!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Esplanade theatres is a place that serves a plethora of cultural palettes. One can just casually walk around the theatre, to encounter street performances in the open air, which of course is a delight to many souls. You get to listen to various kinds of orchestra and bands playing and people gathering around to listen. Of course, you can always pay to go in to theate to encounter the artists of your choice. The thatre is spacious with five levels of sitting arrangements, all of which offer a clear view of the stage and the performers. The sound system is impeccable. One should experience at least one evening with the people you love and those who have similar taste of course   sitting in the theatre to enjoy a concert or a performance. It is a must."
Esplanade Theatre,5,🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 experience to be cherrished
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Day and night, rain or shine, its the one and only must go places in Singapore.

I'm not going to post any pictures because I want YOU to go and enjoy the place yourself, both indoors and outdoors (inclusive of its rooftop terrace).

As in Linkin Park's Jay-Z remixed Numb... ""What the hell are you waiting for..?!!!""."
Esplanade Theatre,5,The first time I been to esplanade was when I was like 17 years old. It gave me deep impression of the building. There are weekly music or singing activities at the outdoor. it's free. Sometimes the band is very good. There is also a child playarea at the top floor. Small but enough for like 25 kids. Anyway it's a good place to hang around during weekend.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Lovely artsy enclave in Singapore!
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Beautiful setting, great view, relaxing live music and it's free! All you need for a chill time!"

There are also lots of food nearby, bubble tea for example (quite expensive tho)."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Free live music, great atmoshere"

Esplanade Theatre,5,The others having a sunbath near riber
Esplanade Theatre,4,"The Esplanade is usually know to be the shape of the fruit, durian. At most times it is quiet but there is a lunch crowd at times at the Toast Box they have there. From its name it clearly tells you that they have performances. Performances from local artists and other people from all around the globe. Check it out for yourself. In my opinion, this place is just go quiet in the mornings through the afternoon."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Nice place for concerts. The concert hall might be cold.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is an awesome place ...the design is so unique .. modern and so unusual architecture involved. There is a library inside this building. Two theatres ..the main hall and small one. And in the library there are studio rooms that you can rent to record your music and vocal also.. From the huge window in the library , you can see the Marina Bay Sands which usually showing the laser ray in the weekend and holiday. Also you can see the beautiful buildings surround by. Nice play ! Two thumbs up !!"

At esplanade, you can enjoy performance at the open air theatre or have a booze with delicious dinner at the restaurant situated right at the esplanade building. With some walking, you can have a taste of Singapore night life as you pick a pub or club at Clarke Quay. While making your way there, you can take some lovely artistic picture with your friends and love ones."

Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is a place where you can go watch good theatre shows that comes from different countries. The environment is comfortable and the sits in the theatre is comfy. You are able to watch the performances at any height,  no need to fear of someone blocking you as the sits are designed to let you see the stage at different heights.  Before going in the theatre,  there are different shops that you can go to eat or shop just before going in.  The toilet is I'm good condition and the place is air-con filled so you don't need to worry about the heat.  I suggest that if you go there you should bring a jacket as sometimes it may be cold."
Esplanade Theatre,5,My fav place in SG!
Esplanade Theatre,5,Marvelous

Esplanade Theatre,5,Love every bit of it
Esplanade Theatre,2,That's at marina
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Actually, we were here to Pip's Playbox that located on the 4th floor. But there were balcony with garden and we could see scenery around Esplanade such as Merlion, Marina Bay Sand, Singapore Flyer, etc. Amazing. Too bad it was raining so we could not be there for longer time."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Really great place to watch a performance! I enjoy the overall energy this whole area brings to the city! Great performers, musicians and bands. I love the view by the water."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Architecture marvel in Singapore! The theatre provides a mesmerizing experience for the audience- great lighting and sound quality.
Had a wonderful experience enjoying a show at Esplanade Theater by the Bay! Loved it!"

Esplanade Theatre,4,"Good place to hangout with friends,good dining places.relax and enjoy the marina area."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice place to chill out on a weekend. Various shows and concerts either in the open air stage or within the building itself. It's free for those. A few restaurant and pubs for a bite and such. Nice cosy library at the top for a quiet moment. Nice hidden gem of the place.
Esplanade Theatre,2,Well Singapore is a wonderful fallacy.  Its a city that shows more than it hides. I walked the path and it was too artificial for me. Who makes giant eggs and trees though. The architecture is an engineering marvel indeed but it doesn't sooth your mind as it should be.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Live arts from locals or overseas performance. Small open air eatery of local cuisine at average price. Really nice view of lights and musical fountain in the evening Marina Bay Sands. Good view to relax with a view of the Bank offices and small lighted boats. Toilets are simple without water hoses. Main Singapore events usually happens at the floating platform nearby. Walkable distance for great relaxing lighted and art views round to Marina Bay Sands and back.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Theater by the bay. Sometimes offers free performances.
Esplanade Theatre,4,A beautiful and unique theatre
Esplanade Theatre,4,lovely time here...walking and ate in one of the small restaurants.. good food too
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Come at night, you get the best view Singapore has to offer. Saturday nights are the best! Live performances, tonnes of people walking around taking pictures. Walk down the bridge to catch the Merlion too!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Came here on June 8, 2019 at about 8 p.m... Watched free live music/bands here... yes, totally free, just take the available outdoor seat and enjoy the performance. They perform nicely... like it! I think this is also one of the recommended places for foreigners/tourists to visit in Singapore."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Conveniently located with MRT and bus stop. But Expensive food probably expensive rent. Even Häagen-Dazs left. Lack of good healthier choice, that is not so rich."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice place ...
Esplanade Theatre,5,Good side see n building architecture
Esplanade Theatre,5,One of the place you need to explore ard when you're in Singapore
Esplanade Theatre,4,"When I saw some social media posting and review this famous coconut ice cream, it makes me really curious how it is! And finally when I went to Singapore last time I found it and It is really great Coconut Ice Cream. It has real coconut slice in it. The taste is fresh and the strawberry topping sauce is also nice. It was very unforgetable moment of enjoying ice cream with a view in Singapore."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"I think the idea and inspiration for architects to design this building, come after they eat 'Durian' fruit.. 😁
Very unique and excellent architecture design 😍👍"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice place for open-air concerts
Esplanade Theatre,5,This is a must visited place in singapore..from here you can go to merlion park

Will visit again soon!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"A beautiful place to visit,  especially the evening. Beautiful view of the bay & city skyline. Merlion currently under restoration is in close proximity. Plenty of eateries, beer bars. Might find some exhibitions or even free indoor, outdoor musicals on occasion of young budding or pro. artists."
Esplanade Theatre,1,"Nice place but should sack the temperature taking Malay uncle lol, need to get his attitude in check. Rude af"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Had dinner with my girlfriend at Mischief down by Esplanade. Together, we had the cheese brocoli, pulled pork fettuccine, and Cajun spiced spring chicken (listed in the order of our preference!) The portion of the food was really big and the quality was pretty good. However, the service can be a bit slow.

Otherwise, the ambience and value is pretty much money for value."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great place to conduct cultural events.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"1st hour parking at $2.20, many parking lots available. Many options to dine in"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"I really love that Esplanade tries to make culture come alive here. There are plenty of programmes for free almost daily and especially on weekends - higher or lower quality, but the most important is that they try. Lots of activities for kids (definitely check Pip's Playbox - and great news IT'S FREE) and amazing outdoor theater with Marina Bay in the background. At night, place becomes a night hang out with nice eateries and drink places.
As the building goes, it's a true gem - just take your camera and explore !
Tip: if you want to avoid crowds, just take the elevator to the roof."
Esplanade Theatre,5,By the side of Marina Bay
Esplanade Theatre,5,"A beautiful building in itself.  Houses good restaurants, interesting shops, so near to all the attractions.  Best of all, the concerts are world class."

Esplanade Theatre,5,Great architecture. Wonderful views of the bay in the park outside. Quality free concerts
Esplanade Theatre,5,Amazing rooftop!
Esplanade Theatre,4,"A fun arts district in the middle of city state. You can find musical concerts in the main area by the river. Art galleries and theatres in the building nearby and it's walking distance from the Merlion Statue and the Helix Bridge. Most guided tours often skip Esplanade, make sure you do visit this one."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautiful place for a walk.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Must see! Place is beautiful place another side of Marina Bay sands. Around area you can find Michelin star restaurant.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Acoustics are good though deciding on seats online is not so intuitive if you haven't been to the venue before.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Spectacular night skyline
Esplanade Theatre,5,"The Durians, as they are affectionately called, are right on the water at Marina Bay and house several large theatres...all very clean and attractive....as is everything in Singapore....and guides are so polite and helpful...another thing I love about Singapore. One evening we participated in the outdoor amphitheatre at a Java dance show and also it was a free show to learn some dancing moves on another outdoor scene."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"We went here to watch their jazz shows for free last July 2018. We usually go here to watch for shows or shop around or even borrow books from the library. This is a perfect place for people who wants to see live shows for free, while enjoying the relaxing view of Marina Bay. I wish they could extend the mall hours though as it usually ends only by 9 or 10pm."
Esplanade Theatre,3,I am not a theatre person. Don’t know how to appreciate this. But I like the fact that it is just next to the Bay. Lovely view there
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Free shows every month, daily performances, activities for kids, plays and performances from all over the world. You name it, they've got it. A must go for art fanatics.

With a huge variety of restaurants, visitors won't leave with a hungry stomach. From Noosh to The Boiler, there's a different gastronomic experience everytime you visit the Esplanade."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"There are scheduled free performances daily. The entire venue is air-conditioned, making it a pleasant place to stop and enjoy what's in front of you. There are some cafes and fringe stores in the area. If you are hungry and adventurous, there's an automated Japanese vending machine cafe at L2."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautiful place to spend time
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great thetare
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Concert halls offer great acoustics and comfortable seating. There are frequent free concerts in the lounge area and outside by the river. Good selection of restaurant, bars and cafes in the complex."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Feel Singapore's arts scene over here. It's bustling with many free and paid high quality arts events. Check their website out. After the events, have a walk along the waterfront or snap a picture with the merlion. I watched the teng ensemble at the esplanade concert hall. The sounds were crystal clear and I enjoyed it."
Esplanade Theatre,3,Nice
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Awesome views of the Marina Bay from here. From there you can walk across the bridge to get to the merlion.
There are from informative guided tours for Esplanade which some might find interesting."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is a really nice area to walk around, with shops and theaters, and it's on the water, always a plus. You can find lots of restaurants, from fine dining to small food stalls, too. A nice place just to go for a stroll, or to see a performance in one of the theaters."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"The building with the design inspired by the durian. Not really look nice, but fun. The design super weird."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Greatest place to roam
Esplanade Theatre,5,Among the best performance arts venues in the world. Unique architecture. Do you think it looks like Durian or insect's compound eyes? LOL
Esplanade Theatre,5,Friday night out free concert
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great place overall. Have a big and comfy library to study. Also have a veriaty of dining option.👍👍
Esplanade Theatre,4,One of its best. Come and enjoy your favorite art performances here.  There are ticketed programmes and also free entrance events
Esplanade Theatre,5,"One of my favorite places in Singapore. This is the first spot from where I saw the skyline of Singapore. Many times you can hear cool music from an event, grab your cheap but delicious food at the food court and just enjoy the breeze of the ocean while gazing at the skyscrapers. At nights, you should definitely watch the MBS light show from the distance at least one time!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Wow. Very cool place not just for kids but the whole family. Since it is close to the water, nice cool breeze welcomes you. There is some good scenery in the background for you to take some nice pics. Highly recommended for tourists. Offers some nice walk."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Very nice theatre. Easy access. Good selection of restaurants.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautifull view from the roof top terrace
Esplanade Theatre,4,Not to miss the live music shows..
Esplanade Theatre,4,Nice place
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great place to visit, love to singing in the theater here one day. Amazing structure."
Esplanade Theatre,5,The night view is amazing..
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay (also known as the Esplanade Theatres or simply The Esplanade) is a performing arts centre located in Downtown Core near the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the nearby Esplanade Park, it consists of a concert hall which seats about 1,600 and a theatre with a capacity of about 2,000 for the performing arts."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is a great open air place where something is happening almost every night. Has a number of eateries around. Weeknights usually see less crowd, but weekends are mostly packed. Has some good bars, Cafe and restaurants around it. A few ATMs also located in the building. Given the location by the bay, makes for an amazing sight of the skyline in the night. A lot of people just sit by the water. On the relatively cheaper end, there is also a hawker style food court with a great range of foods. This place makes a great destination on any night of the week for any reason. Definitely worth a visit."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Superb venue and a credit to Singapore. Wonderful acoustics, comfortable seatyand overall a great design. We went to see the Dance Appreciation Series for the Don Quixote ballet. Mainly aimed at children and young people, but I'm 74 and I thought it was a superb experience. 5 stars no problem."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"There are always interesting rotating art exhibits at the Esplanade, as well as shows ranging from plays to instrumentals. The shows are reasonably priced, especially for students and seniors. There are also frequently free live music by amateur bands in the evening (starting at 7pm) that are pretty fabulous. I like that this is a nonprofit organization that exists to support the arts, which is so important for our community. It both encourages and reminds us to slow down and enjoy beauty, in an increasingly fast paced digital world. There is also an awesome library here with a magnificent view of Marina Bay. I highly recommend visiting the Esplanade!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Fantastic concert hall.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"A scenic waterfront view fr Esplanade.
We can enjoy beautiful orchestra music @ the Explanade ~ Beautiful Sunday."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Singapore's premier arts venue. Free performances almost everyday!
Esplanade Theatre,5,I never imagine i was here
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great place with good views
Esplanade Theatre,4,"A truly enjoyable time spent. I went to the joanna dong concert and sat in the middle section directly facing the stage.
All the while the performer seems to be looking directly at us. This definitely makes for a much more engaging experience and you can feel the performance much better.

Lighting and sound was very intriguing. This is a venue worth visiting for sure when you are in  Singapore."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Went for the outdoor showcase. Good audio. Nice ambience. The cupcorn sold at the kiosks nice, hot and sweet. Goes well with sugarcane juice."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Good place for dine and chill after a hard day work! Free musical entertainment as you chill.
Esplanade Theatre,5,MAX POWER
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice backdrop.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Surrounding area is pleasing on the eyes. The nearby shopping area and restaurants are quite good.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Hands down one of the most aesthetic places in Singapore.

The ground floor is lined with a lot of nice bars and the mini performance corner outside. Can see MBS from here. The kiosks outdoors can satisfy one's sweet tooth.

The library is full of performing arts related materials, but little space for studying or reading papers. Nonetheless, not many people visit this branch anyway so shouldn't be too much of a worry that there are no seats.

The theatre has gorgeous interior design.  Amazing for concerts and performances."
Esplanade Theatre,3,Peaceful
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great public space with free concerts usually during the weekends, walk towards the Bay Grandstand to reach one of the most ideal spot to photograph Marina Bay Sands"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Enjoyed the sushi and sake.  Helpful staff.  On the pricey side.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Well decorated, with all facilities including air conditioned the place offers variety of shows as well as few galleries and shops. The hall is well equipped as well."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Actually I didn't go into any theatres but just wandered around the area, which is quite nice. Some nice and unusual architecture which makes the area more interesting."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Was here got getai fun night. Breezy view of Cbd district.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great performances
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Excellent place to hang out, enjoy free music and the beautiful scenery."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"If you are crazy over concerts, opera, Broadway shows or even celebrity Music Artist Esplanade is a must go place.
One of the top theatres in the world. Esplanade and surrounding is very much interesting too.
The amenities are great too! After a performance talk an enchanting walk along the river..."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Besides the slightly stressful adventure of getting to the venue on time, we had a truly great time at Theatres by the Bay watching the final matinee performance of the Singapore Dance Theatre's interpretation of The Nutcracker! The Asian twist to the otherwise classic ballet made it as interesting as ever and the performances by the orchestra and performers were both outstanding! Can't wait to watch another performance there again!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,For the ambience on a wkends
Esplanade Theatre,5,where we can go watch concerts in singapore
Esplanade Theatre,5,There events and show all years round both paid and free. Great place to enjoy and entertain yourself. Rooftop is great place for photo; facing Singapore River. Great scenery. Must come for photo!
Esplanade Theatre,4,Cultural hub in downtown Singapore. Esplanade is a non profit that always has some exciting free or paid events ongoing during all evenings of the week. The open air theatre is particularly lovely in that backdrop. Must visit place in Singapore
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great theater place😁
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Sometimws there are free shows , check esplanade's website to find out more.

Theres bars, restaurants , an anime cafe and a few public stages. The view from the river is perfect for photos you can bring home as it features our city skyline.

Great place to visit."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Good performances, poor accoustic"
Esplanade Theatre,5,I love this place!
Esplanade Theatre,4,It's unique and vibrant place to go for beautiful scenery with the shop and entertainment concerts definitely help with wonderful atmosphere
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Beautiful place, perfect cooling and wonderful acoustics !!!!!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Always one of my favourite places in Singapore. Plenty of food options and an outdoor stage for free music. Also has an indoor stage for special performances.
Esplanade Theatre,2,"The food selection at Esplanade has dropped tremendously in terms of quality selection and variety. Decor and art displays have become somewhat ""lacklustre"" and uninspired. Show lineups are awfully boring. So much for so-called ""World class"", Esplanade needs to step up!"
Esplanade Theatre,4,The famous landmark at the Singapore waterfront. Nice to chill out for a bar at one of the al fresco bars on a cool night and enjoy the skyline
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Plenty of free performances here as well. And it's next to the Singapore River for a nice evening stroll. All and all, a really chill and awesome place to be at. With pretty great bars and restaurants nearby. But hey, it's in town, so prices will be steep. Then again, you're in Singapore, you gotta expect that."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"So this is one fo the places you need to visit if you re in Singpaore. it is a man made marvel of modern times and it is amazing. I love the retail seleciton that is in here. The theatre building is so beautiful. Also the area which is probably the open theatre area, is amazing with a backdrop of MBS and water. It is quite pretty. I could sit there and just do some people watching. one of the another spots to do that! I ahve attended few concerts here and it is quite fun and interesting."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"An unmissable structure. the free flowing form with outer layer of triangular planes gives a feeling of live architecture.
A concert hall which seats about 1,600 and a theatre with a capacity of about 2,000 for the performing arts. The design consists of two rounded space frames fitted with triangulated glass elements and sunshades, which balance outward views with solar shading."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Very nice and relaxing walk along the bank in the evening with a fantastic view of Sands Hotel and the skyline of financial district across the water. For music lovers the amphitheater has free concerts and a few bars nearby. Definitely worth going
Esplanade Theatre,5,Viewed a Thai music + dance performance here for free. It was an interesting performance (for someone unfamiliar with this aspect of Thai culture) and I left feeling like I'd learnt something about an aspect of physical performance that I now see signs of in other places. Great view of the bay from here too.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"One of the landmarks in Singapore that I have grown to be fond and proud of. Besides attending musical performances here, I enjoy visiting the library@Esplanade as it has books on drama and music not available in other branches. Here’s an ideal place to immerse yourself in the arts and gain inspiration."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Singapore’s Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay and Esplanade Mall comprise a multi-purpose arts centre incorporating a Concert Hall, Theatre and outdoor performance area, bringing a fantastic array of shows to the bay area of the city as well as some great shopping and dining. Great for families and love ones."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Wonderful outdoor theatre with setup for decent audio quality and the lion city skyline as backdrop. Part of the experience that makes Singapore grow on me.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Place of performances and feelings. If you love the thrill of having different emotions at once, head down for performances and plays there. Do visit the rooftop because it is super pretty to look out from."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Beautifully designed and build that blends in to the surrounding. One of my favorite spots to visit and chill. Tourists also likes to visit the place as well.
Esplanade Theatre,5,A mall with plenty of visual and performing arts happening and related stores. Good food options everywhere. There is a public library on the top floor. Right there in the Marina Bay where there is a lot of going on all the time.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great place, very clean"
Esplanade Theatre,4,Excellent acoustics in the concert halls with a variety of layouts for different types of performances.  Remember to collect your pass during intermissions for your return to the concert halls.  There was a open performance at the foyer with casual seating for the public - nice touch indeed!
Esplanade Theatre,4,"The place is cool. And they have a annex studio,recycle theatre and practice theatre in addition. Many food options. Famouse makansutra there"
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Lovely place for music lover with gorgeous view. There was the festival of voices over the weekend. Checkup free events and qorkahops. There's a library where you can book music rooms, including piano room or TV room etc online for an affordable price. Short walk from City Hall MRT."
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Oh i simply love being here at the Esplanade.
I come here on weekends evenings to enjoy not only the OUTDOOR performances, but also the breathtaking view of this man-made beauty....the Sands Hotel, the rich banking skyline, the serenity of Spore River as the sun disappears donno to where and of course the nearby  still affordable hawker fare which many find impossible to have a bite when it rains.
Hoping to listen to music which i can relate to this evening. Thank you Esplanade."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great views, many rest zones, bicycle lanes, public lavatories. Everything you need to have a fascinating stroll. Worth visiting both during the day and nighttime"
Esplanade Theatre,5,This outdoor theatre overlooking the bay and the iconic structures is a lively spot where Singaporeans and the tourists get to savour the local and international music and other performing arts free.
Esplanade Theatre,5,If you want to view a theatre with thorns like a durian.
Esplanade Theatre,4,It is just beside Marina Sands resort and near merlion park. You can enjoy the amazing view of the bay and downtown Singapore.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Perfect place to bring your drink and chill on the steps of the water body at night... alone or with a friend. And watch the permanent light show....
Esplanade Theatre,5,Good environment for live music.

With library that has many good resources for artist."
Esplanade Theatre,5,There are loads of things to do on the esplanade. Lots of eating places; shows to see; or just chill out. The performances for the public are free. You will be kept entertained. There are some nice and pleasant views of the area. Visiting in the evenings is best. almost nightly public free performance inside the esplanade atrium. choice of restaurants to choose from and also local food from makan sutra outdoor food area. evening visit would be better.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"For the art and music. When I was there on a sat night, there are live band, people singing on karaoke and opera singing and you can listen for free. Really interesting place if you like these activities. Oh ya.. SSO also perform there... Of cos with a tix price"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Love the food and drinks here. Lots of option. But more importantly the rooftop has a bar called Orgo and can get fantastic views of the city. Would be the ideal place for a date and to enjoy the skyline! Highly recommend for anyone visiting to go there both during the day and at night as the skyline looks very different
Esplanade Theatre,4,I come to appreciate a variety of good performance every year for the Huayi Festival
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great place to sit around if you have got nothing better to do and want to escape the crowds at Marina Square. Occasional free performances.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Really betfull view
Esplanade Theatre,5,Modern and well-equipped concert hall that has a large seating capacity. Great for shows. Toilet as clean and area was accessible.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Another beautiful place to soak in the atmosphere of marina bay sands!
Plenty to do from shopping at the nearby malls to enjoying a meal by the bay offering breath taking views of the area!
Neat, clean and well maintained public areas!
People are friendly and helpful in giving directions to the best sight seeing and eat outs around!
Overall, a great experience.✌👌🍻"
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Very happening place and many free artistic events to enjoy almost every day of the week. It is veritable feast for the senses. In terms of food for the stomach, Makansutra isn't as good as it used to be, but Ciak restaurant is a worthy rival."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Good accoustic. Ample parking spaces. Courteous staff.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Excellent stage and theater. There are always free but nice performances. Nice to spend weekends here...

Esplanade Theatre,4,Toilets  super clean n v v nice scenery. Gd for couples. Date.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Splendid architecture that glitters at night! not sure if everyone will like the music performance played at the main gallery (it's free of cost if I'm not wrong). I liked one of the performance. Uploaded it here. Worth visiting it.
Esplanade Theatre,5,A place to chill
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Just love walking around and through here when in Singapore. Always something new and different happening. Check out the schedule for pair for and free shows/events and make your choice, browse the shops, eat at one of the restaurants... Just go!"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Striking architectural form created by textured glazed roof. When we visited there were impromptu performances in the lobby.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Esplanade is a nice place to chill out. There are free music performances. I enjoy going to the library above the concert halls. There are a few eateries to dine in. It offers a good of the marina barrage waters.
Esplanade Theatre,4,The major venue for the performing arts in Singapore. Many free events throughout the year. A great place to go and explore if you are looking for something to do. The library has a decent inventory of music and videos for rent. Several restaurants are close by for pre or post concert dining.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Amazing Marina Bay Sands
Esplanade Theatre,5,Beautiful place with wonderful music. Lots of interesting food and spaces. Its a classic space. Has a library too! Music and books all in one location. Bars and eateties here have decent food and fine music. Worth visiting.
Esplanade Theatre,5,The sound system at this place is dope! For an outdoor scene. And the view itself works as a beautiful backdrop to enjoy a blissful night out of town. It's free seating and performances are usually free.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Good experience. Was there to watch performances at the concourse and at the waterfront. Very good that esplanade caters to the seniors with music and songs of yesteryears.
It was very breezy at the waterfront in the evening."
Esplanade Theatre,4,The performance atmosphere was good but the aircon is not cold enough.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Full of beautiful music and art ~
Esplanade Theatre,5,The whole building both outside and inside is fascinating. At first I though I would have to pay to watch some of shows but was completely wrong. There were shows both being held inside and outside that I thoroughly enjoyed. The one I enjoyed was the one done by the Indonesian guys with the drums. I thought it was really good. There was another Indonesian show called the sacred drama of Kunti Sraya. It was quite long and I already watched a similar one in Bali and so didn’t watch till the end. It’s a great atmosphere and so many people come to watch it. You also have the Marina Bay Sands in the background. Would definitely recommend.
Esplanade Theatre,5,I love this
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Icon for Singapore. Its a theatre hall and the whole area has fair food places, a hawker lane in the evenings and an open air amphitheatre that often showcases local musical talent against the backdrop of the Marina bay.

Good place to have a few drinks in the evening. Photo opportunity against the MBS which is across the bay.

Pleasant place to walk."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Good selection of shops. Good shows. Well stocked arts focused library
Esplanade Theatre,5,"one of the greatest joy of travelling... to see great buildings, and this is one of the best."
Esplanade Theatre,5,If you are in Singapore book a show to see what a great theater this is. Superb
Esplanade Theatre,5,Always love it here..

Esplanade Theatre,5,Beauty and impression
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice view at night
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great performing centre, with a library,  nice restaurants.
What's there not to like?"
Esplanade Theatre,5,So beautiful
Esplanade Theatre,5,"One of the iconic structures of Singapore... awesome structure... m.s structure is superbly executed...

Theatre parking is under main road.. accessibility of theatre is very well planned.. for vehicular and pedestrian.....

While entrying in esplanade theatre had thought of crossing the road via subway.. however using the subway I entered the parking of esplanade theatre...  main highway have 2 level basement which is being used by the theatre is incredible...

As an indian I got very impressed by the vehicular and pedestrian integration and even gave me new vision to think of it..."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Fantastic place for the performing arts. There are programs scheduled regularly. Not only that, there are a few restaurants and cafes that you can chill or sit down for a meal. Of course, don't forget to admire that iconic ""spiky"" durian roof from the outside."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Without doubt the best place to grab one of the great concerts or performances in Singapore - they're often for free. The building itself is also worth a visit.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Clean and quit place there is other food to eat also
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Went for new year countdown at esplanade this year! There is a food spot to catch unobstructed view of fireworks there, right next to the stage outside Esplanade"

Esplanade Theatre,4,The piano studio was small and can accommodate about 300 audience? The piano sound was very beautiful and I could not hear any echoes. Acoustics were acceptable for me.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Beautiful theatre for music and drama performances - both indoor and outdoors. Has a few F&B outlets that caters to a good mix of tastes whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner or just as places to hang out with some ice cream and such. Wide range of music performances and many of them are free of charge."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"This is the second time I have been to a ballet performance here. The venue is well laid out and it is easy to see the whole stage from the vast majority of seats. The sound is also well managed and is set so that it is easy to here the music but doesn't attack your ears. It is very easy to get here. There is a bus stop at the door, an MRT station is within walking distance and a taxi rank is also at the door. I would recommend you use an app to get a taxi otherwise you could be waiting for quite a while. There are also plenty of places to get something to eat before or after the show. All in all a great venue."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"It's a very iconic building on the bayfront, and hard to miss! It's a reflection of Singapore and its culture, with the architecture resembling a Durian fruit. I'd recommend stopping by at night on the weekend, as it is beautiful when all lit up and there are often free concerts."
Esplanade Theatre,4,Good place for photos and imagine would be good for outdoor concerts (bearing in mind the heat!) Didn't go into the theatre itself so can't comment
Esplanade Theatre,5,"We went to get Merlion statue.
The place was good.

Esplanade Theatre,5,Grand
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice place to hang out
Esplanade Theatre,5,World class entertainment space for the stage and musical acts
Esplanade Theatre,5,"When we arrived in the Singapore bay area where we noticed the odd and modernistic ""bug-eyed"" domed buildings and wondered what they were. We were quite surprised to find out that the were really theaters of the arts. You really need to see these these buildings space-aged buildings. We thought they were beautiful and hope to attend a ballet or musical performance here one day on a future visit."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Always a treat to visit the Esplanade. Every weekend, there are free performances and it never disappoints. The performance halls are definitely worth the price of admission, so catch your favourite shows when it's showing."
Esplanade Theatre,5,Nice & relax place.
Esplanade Theatre,5,Great place to hang out especially on weekends. There's free music everyday at the Concourse and on weekends at the Outdoor Theatre. You can get good food catering to small and medium budgets. Another must visit Singapore attraction

It's an amazing tour of the backstage and get to know the technical aspects of the Concert and Music Hall.

I just wish more Singaporeans have the opportunity to know this Singapore  Treasure."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Beautiful, clean, sometimes having live performances for aspiring musicians."
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Free concerts, chill vibes. Good riverside outdoor venue as well"

Esplanade Theatre,4,This is great venue to visit. The theatres are  beautiful and the views of the bay are great for evening walks.
Esplanade Theatre,4,"Good accoustic. A variety of venues, also a public one. Inside and outside. Good ambience. There is also a seasonal exhibition. This time was photography exhibition of a teacher follow up some orphans"
Esplanade Theatre,5,Futuristic architecture.
Esplanade Theatre,5,"Great!!! Just like the other attractions that Singapore has to offer, a must see & shopping experience with the amazing movie theater.

Esplanade Theatre,4,Nice theatres for arts n events performance. Well maintain n centrally located in city.
Esplanade Theatre,4,Great place to hang out and listen to chill music.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I would recommend people to stay in the gardens as long as possible to see the trees under sunlight and at night. When it is cloudy, the view up at the skyway is very breathtaking as you can see all the clouds moving up there. The light shows at night are very amazing too. They play different musics every time, it was classical music during my first visit and for national day they played the national anthem. There are multiple gardens of different themes on the ground. It is not too tiring if you ride a bike from the gardens to the east coast park, the view alongside is good for this route."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Singapore has been my 2nd home and it continuously fascinates me.  One of its famous attraction and a must to go will be the Gardens by the Bay.

It mimics a forest with tons of plants and flowers for you to choose from. It gives you a different vibe and experience of a forest within the city.  Every year they decorate it with festive designs and colorful lights that the kids and the old ones will definitely enjoy.

Within that area lies the two other domes: Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest which will give you a big WOW.  I've been to these places countless times yet I never ever get bored neither tired of strolling around this place.  And it's also the best place for me to jog and have been into different marathons in this place which also covers my full 42km marathon.

It was indeed such a memorable place for me and I highly recommend it to everyone to drop by to this place for you to unwind and have the merriest experience of your Singapore trip!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful place for a walk and both domes are worth the experience. I visited the special art exhibit.  Fantastic.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Nice place. Go to both cloud forest and flower dome. Well worth it. Very pretty flowers. Quite picturesque if you want to take photos. Saw a wedding couple. 😊😊

Gift shop not great. Expensive and limited merchandise."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I have been here. This is man-made. However, the natural beauty here is amazing. Wonderful. I went here in an international group when we attended a conference in Singapore. The atmosphere here is amazing. Everyone one is so happy and excited to be in this world famous garden. Singaporeans did this this project so perfectly it feels really natural here."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A wonderful tourist attraction.
I am quite proud with the way they are maintaining this place even though it is phase 3. I see new exhibits every time I visit this place. It feels like something out of a book. I must say their exhibits are getting more advanced.
I feel bad that it is quite empty nowadays.
There are really good cafes and restaurants nearby.
Overall, a great place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,A place to go for some fresh air and change of scenery. Feels great to sit down beneath the giant trees and take a pause.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Went for the total experience of the Glass in Bloom by Dale Chihuly..very beautiful sculpture exhibits. Weather was really wonderful.  Really enjoyed the experience.  Thanks to the team for the good work done!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Absolutely mesmerizing. There are no words to describe the magnificance of this place. It looks like something from a dream. It is a mix of nature and technology. It is huge and intimidating but beautiful at the same time.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Quite a lovely place to walk around. Think the pass for the 2 domes are pretty worth it too. They at a discount now too. The tree too walk is quite an experience too.Quite a wide area that you can walk around and then end up at the barrage for an awesome view or have a meal at the satay by the bay. There is also the park area across the bridge from the barrage as well that you can explore.

It's such a stark contrast with the concrete structures on the other side at MBS there."
Gardens by the Bay,5,If you are in Singapore you absolutely must come here.  Something amazing !  It is most beautiful in the evening when all the trees are beautifully illuminated.  You can sit down and listen to the beautiful music coming out of the trees.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"We landed there recently after a 2 year gap, and relived our fantastic experience all over again.
A great testament to Singapore 's creative confluence of nature, art and technology and of course an evening sunset woh splendid photo opportunities all around."
Gardens by the Bay,3,"Large expanse of garden-like environment.... Can be hot n humid because of the weather. Be prepared wth hat, hand-held fan n lots of walking. Latest exhibits of glass sculptures are the high points."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Must visit here when you are in Singapore. Everything is great, beautiful. So amazing. Hope to come here again soon.
Photos taken in 2017."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Excellent place for adults and kids. Very beautiful, well maintained and thoughtfully made. Children's garden is excellent!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A garden sitting right in the city, not only with many variety of flowers n plants, if u are lucky, u will see the MBS Otter family enjoying their meals.
If you enjoy bird watching, u will find some interesting birds hiding in the Wetland.
It is pet friendly, you can enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of beer at the Coco cafe with your pets sitting beside u."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Singapore’s Central Park in its CBD!

The 250-acre Gardens by the Bay reflects the city planners ""City in a Garden"" intent and is built on reclaimed land at Marina Bay. Opened in 2012, it’s famous for its super trees.

Designed by Grant Associates, the final construction cost topped $1B."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"great experience with family here. around 7pm we enjoyed the light show with music, a lot of families sat down and waited for the show. it’s a good show, nice place. you can also explore the gardens, because there’s a lot gardens to visit 😄 and it’s free by the way, i didn’t have time to visit the gardens that need tickets.."
Gardens by the Bay,2,"More like a supporting facility for Marina Bay Sands than a real garden/park. Most of SG’s natural reserves and of course the botanic garden is much more worth going. That being said, if you live nearby it’s not such a bad idea to go jogging or sit there for no more than 10 minutes, before u get bored."
Gardens by the Bay,5,the best picnic spots and awesome views
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gardens by the Bay during Phase 3 (Heightened Alert). Hope everything will get back to normal in this 2021 2H!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great fun @ Gardens by the Bay with my
Old folks. Rent a wheelchair for $2 for the whole day. Book your visiting schedule on the app and visit the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome is a breeze.

I like it that it’s air conditioned and not very crowded for photo taking and it convenient for kids and old folks as it’s accessible for wheelchairs and prams. Took lots of beautiful pictures of wonderful flowers and plants too :)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay, Singapore, comprises two cooled conservatories – the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, situated along the edge of Marina Reservoir.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"I am not a fan of artificial gardens, but I would miss it if I had not visited Gardens by the bay. Words cannot express how beautiful this place is. I never knew they can build such a big artificial waterfall and make a garden around it. Also, the flower dome was decorated with Sakura which was breathtaking."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place for a stroll. I just talk around the compound, didn't buy the ticket for dome entry as it as an early stroll."
Gardens by the Bay,4,This green space is perfect for enjoying the vibrant plant life and escaping the city bustle for a moment. Me and my family had a great fun roaming around the place on the cluster of the iconic lotus shaped structure . The intricate design of the futuristic plant structure with the vines crawling on it is unbelievable.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Love this beautifully designed pubpic space! Access is easy via public transport. The Children's Garden is a welcome respite for families. So many nooks and crannies to explore, which makes for many return visits."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lovely conservatories. Sections give a snapshot of Mediterranean, South African and Latin American tree civilizations. The flower conservatory may take an hour or more, but the cloud forest walk is 45 minutes or so."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful garden! Recommend the flower dome as well!

A lot of wildlife like otters!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Fun place on a weekday to take a walk, but nothing really to shout about."

*See if you can find the tree with fruits that looks like coconuts."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The most beautiful place that ive been . A lot of animals , birds , flowers , pretty trees , palms and other. The botanic gardens was beautiful and amazing too . Singapore is the most wonderful place in the world .✨"

Gardens by the Bay,5,Singapore botanick Garden Is  amaizing place.
Gardens by the Bay,5,I took this photo from somewhere in Singapore Flyer while cycling around Marina Bay (14 km start-end at the stadium). The Gardens by the Bay is such a beauty even after the sun has set. It is a beautiful and serene place to chill among plants and flowers and fresh air too. It can be a regular hang out place with a yearly pass!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Wonderful place to spend your day in Singapore. View Singapore from a different perspective. wonderful collection of plants and flowers around the world. with some thematic time to time. Thumbs up!
Gardens by the Bay,4,A very good place for people who can going to....
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the best in the world. Garden by the bay offers a spectacular view of the city from the top of the man-made towers. It’s very impressive to see how they integrate man-made structure with nature.. kids friendly , totally free to visit and there’s eatary like Mcdondalds if you’re hungry. Worth to visits. So beautiful"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Been here many times and always a pleasure to be back.
Great environment, super clean, well organized, plants well maintained.
Only down side is there is one plant that belongs to the mint family but was labeled with the common name “lavender” which can be quite misleading for people who genuinely want to learn about plants.
Otherwise a great place and always happy to be back."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Given that Singapore is a ""Garden City"", this is probably one of the must gos. Even if you don't decide to visit the Flower Dome or Cloud Forest, just an evening stroll from the Super Tree Groves all the way to Marina Bay Sands or the Esplanade makes a very pleasant evening stroll for both families and couples alike.

If you are a photographer, well we'll let our pictures speak for themselves.

Gardens by the Bay,5,A great place to spend the weekend with family!

Gardens by the Bay,5,"A beautiful place to visit in the heart of Singapore! ✨
A major attraction which is a must visit, while in Singapore; especially for nature enthusiasts and people who admire natural beauty. It has huge varieties of flowers, trees, mosses, etc.

The place is immaculate, plants look Super healthy and happy. Lots of interesting things to see and some of the plants we saw I haven’t seen before. It’s a place you must visit if you are in Singapore. It’s open all year."
Gardens by the Bay,2,"There are 2 to 3 conservatories, the futuristic dome buildings are worth a visit. The super trees merely serve as decorations, not really very artistic. The public grounds is similar to the many public parks mainly green flora and trees."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Went on one of the weekend morning...Nice place to have a walk and the place is so well maintained
Gardens by the Bay,5,Quite a stunning feature.  Amazingly beautiful piece of engineering.  Better to visit at night time.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Been here multiple times throughout the years. The gardens, domes and skyways are always well kept, clean and beautiful. The day/night scenes are unique in their own ways. Great place for strolls after meals, after or during rain or simply any time of the day. This is a must-see location when visiting Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Go during festive seasons (Chinese new year, Christmas, etc). Beautiful decorations even at places that do not require paid entry :)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the most modern gardens you will ever visit. Highly recommended to visit the flower dome and cloud forest. If the weather permits, you can stay till the night where the super tree structures light up. It’s really beauty at night and pretty peaceful as well. There is also a large lake and lots of paths you can stroll along."
Gardens by the Bay,5,best place to have a fresh environment to chill and relax
Gardens by the Bay,5,Had a wonderful time and visual experience at the Dale Chihuly exhibition at Garden by the Bays. Well curated.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely beautiful and breathtaking! There's so much to see here--gardens and waterfalls and everything in between. It feels like the Avatar movie come to life. Make sure to come here a little earlier, so you can have plenty of time to see the gardens before the light show. It's very efficient, crowd control is done well and people are pretty respectful for the most part. Highly recommend!

Note: Visited prior to COVID, so things may be different."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best places to hang and chill at night. Would recommend coming here when there's a special event like Mid Autumn Festival 🥮 or Christmas so you can see more attractions!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lots of areas to explore even if you have been there couple of times, other than the usual Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. Definitely worth a visit and spending a day to explore the place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,It’s take about an hour each to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Another hour or more to walk around the open park and have lunch/dinner. Be prepared to spend 3-4 hours when visiting Garden by the Bay.
Gardens by the Bay,4,One of the most iconic park in Singapore! A great place to view the beautiful cityscape of Marina bay and to take some awesome photos!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Dale Chihuly-Glass in Bloom
If you are unable to travel overseas to view this awesome glass exhibit, you should try to find time to go to Gardens by the Bay to take a look. It is not free though. Take a look at some of the pictures that I have taken. If you think it is worth your time (and FB or Instagram), why not drop by and be mesmerised 😊"
Gardens by the Bay,5,First time going up to Supertree Observatory. Love the view 50m above ground!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of my favourite places in Singapore, and really pretty too. Great place for picnics, dates, or just walking around, since the garden is really big.

The garden is very clean, and staff are helpful and friendly. Its great to see how the staff enforce COVID19 measures too, and they take it very seriously.

Tickets are worth the price, and overall the experience is really great! a must visit! however, do take note that its really crowded on weekends (like VERY) so try to go on weekdays instead to avoid the crowd 😊"
Gardens by the Bay,3,the Dale Chihuly glass artwork is good but not worth the entry fee...
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of my favorite place to visit.

Gardens by the Bay,5,Wonderful place with a wonderful atmosphere which makes you feel like you are overseas.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Wonderful idea and really appreciate this great creative design.  Suitable to visit with family or friends.  Especially, very beautiful at night time."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I love the new additions to the Cloud Forest. There is Moth Orchid Display, Glass in Bloom and other sculptures in the conservatory.

The cool waterfall at the entrance is a great welcoming sight especially on a hot and humid day.

The tree top walk and the Lost World are interesting too.

There is also a Secret Garden at the end of the exhibition hall, with exotic flora that makes me marvel at nature's beauty in a different perspective.

I highly recommend all Singaporeans to join as Friends of Gardens and be proud ambassors of our Gardens.

Thank you GBTB for the wonderful experience."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Extremely cool place to visit. I highly recommend first time visitors go to the cloud dome. It’s amazingly cool with a pretty big indoor waterfall!

Gardens by the Bay,5,"The place is beautiful with lots of plants variety to look at. Especially inside the two domes. Remember to check out the pricing online and buy the tickets online first before coming over to collect it. It will be faster this way. One of the dome has the world's tallest indoor waterfall and the place is beautiful. The other dome has various plants at different season.

Remember to check out the maintenance of the indoor waterfall for the day of your visit. I went once and it was closed.

There are other places to look around outside of the domes but usually it's too hot during the day.

There are light and music show at the supertree groves at 8pm and other timings. There are also food places nearby the supertree groves to dine at.

You can go back towards the city with a link bridge towards Marina Bay Sands (the ship like hotel).

Enjoy your day here !"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay is a must stop if you enjoy the outdoors. There are two conservatories that has entrance fee to explore the inside, but if you’re short on time or don’t want to pay, you can visit the outside grounds for free. We found many our favorite photos were from this part of the garden. The super trees light up at night and make for great photo around dusk time."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Out of this world, amazing place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Be ready for an out of the world experience. Reach early to get a good spot and then relax and wait for the show to start. Since this a popular spot in Singapore, it can get crowded. So get there early. The whole show is breathtaking and beautiful. Words can't describe the experience, you just have to go and experience it. Do not miss it any cost."
Gardens by the Bay,5,This place should be a must in your itinerary while visiting Singapore. Beautifully designed and we'll maintained. This place has plethora of flora and is a pleasant escape from the humid weather of Singapore. You can feel the freshness of the environment as soon as you enter the establishment. Beautiful beyond words. This place must be visited to appreciate its beauty. Visit the Super tree area at around 8pm local time to catch the light show. Always check for availability of tickets online as the slots fill up pretty fast and you'll avail some good discounts.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful skyline we have and this picture was captured from the food court. My baby had a ball as there’s plenty of space to walk around.
Gardens by the Bay,5,I love Gardens by the Bay!!!!😍😍😍😍 When visiting Singapore going to this park is a must!!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Place well kept, clean and friendly knowledgeable staff to approach for information."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Undoubtedly the best attraction in Singapore. Better to visit in the evening for the lights and cool breeze. Don't forget to bring your camera to capture the moments.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Had a good time visiting here. The best time is to visit during evenings after dark so can experience the beauty of the wonderful lights. Please note the place remains closed when it rains.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Nice place to visit. Need to book your visiting time, so not too crowded."

Gardens by the Bay,5,Singapore's iconic landmarks. Public park. No entry fee.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Went during school holidays. Making use of the discovery vouchers. Place was rather crowded but there are time slots where groups of people can enter. The theme now is Japanese and Sakura. There are several torii gates in the design of the garden. There’s also a few hello kitty themed display where people queue to take pictures. It can take awhile while in queue cos everyone wants to take a few photos and different styles. All in all it’s nice to visit especially it’s cooling and can escape from the sun.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing garden with many attractions and places to see. The world renowned Super trees are a joy to experience. Catch the light shows at night.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Always spectacular, it feels empty in this age of Covid restrictions, but remains a welcoming oasis in the middle of high tech Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Its a Exotic and Enchanted attractive spot in singapore! We visited there in March 2020 (before covid) that time it was filled with Sakura Matsuri theme🌸. They just brought Japan here❤️❤️ Now the ticket price have gone very less $. Take the Cloud Forest first then take take the Flower Dome. There is also GBB Gift Shop at level 1, and they have a plenty of lot interesting things. You need at least a hour to finish the shop."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Traffic control with limited visitors each session for River Hong Bao 2021, enable visitors to move around & take nice pictures with less crowd"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Highly acclaimed and voted by many influential medias and travel portals as one of the best gardens in the world, Gardens by the Bay truly live up to its name. Over the years, it is a must visit for any Singapore traveller, and a venue for numerous events on the yearly calender. Spend a whole day here, even just the selfie or serious photography spots are already dizzying. And if you're a floral, fauna person, the flowers, plants, bugs and birds will keep you super busy. The gardens are segmented into various themed divisions and self tour guide tours are visibly located. Toilets and amenities are plentiful, even if you're hungry, eats and hawkers nearby at Satay by the Bay. Highlights here of course are the Sky trees, the flower dome and the cloud forest. I am not going to spoil the surprise but if you're touring Singapore, spare at least half a day here, at least. And if you're a resident in Singapore, it pays to be a Friend of the Garden yearly patron. Beside the occasional themed events, you can enjoy frequent dome and forest visits, you can also come exercise at the track just by the bay, chill at the sky trees, or enjoy a walk around the park. Curated nature at its best."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Thousands of flowers with many colors nicely arranged.
Tropical highlands in the Cloud Forest was the worth experience."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Always find it refreshing to visit each time. Never feel tired of the beautiful lightning.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I was lucky to visit Gardens By the Bay twice and both visits were amazing. They change their themes every now and then. The place was clean, crews were respectful and friendly. Very systematic set up and very safe. Their offerings are very educational on environment. Bring your children and oldies here. They will enjoy and will love it."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Lovely place to visit in Singapore. We couldn't see flowers there since we went late evening to visit gardens by the bay.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Using the SingapoRediscovers Voucher, I used up $40 of it for a short family trip and I thought  is well worth it. Our first time there as a family, I recommend this place for its cleanliness and magnificent display of a huge selection of exotic plants and flowers. I had chosen to visit the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, and I must say that the waterfall is a must go to for memorable pictures! It cost $20 per adult fire both comes. Nearby has a Mcdonald, n you can probably take s quick breakfast before going. It took us ard 3 hours to complete both domes, comfortably. :)"
Gardens by the Bay,4,Loving the Sakura Blossoms n Hello Kitty at Flower Dome 🌸
Gardens by the Bay,4,Love the space. Great for picnics and gentle sports. Water cooler near the Meadows was under construction so ended up having to walk about 15 mins to find water at another water cooler.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Impressive! Really a fantastic place.
Gardens by the Bay,5,It was awesome to be back and see more unique flowers and the shakura flowers
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A national garden and premier horticultural attraction for local and international visitors, Gardens by the Bay is a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry that presents the plant kingdom in a whole new way, entertaining while educating visitors with plants seldom seen in this part of the world"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Came to the Gardens by the bay for the River Angbao 2021. This edition featured a giant god of fortune lantern with a modern twist to it.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lovely and big free park. Many different sections to explore the different varieties of trees and plants. Wonderful playground with water play area to keep kids occupied. Can also walk, run or bike to Marina Barrage and East Coast Park nearby."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Almost all urban cities around the world try to build parks and botanical gardens to give their residents some sense of nature connection but Singapore's visionary ambitious approach takes it a step further. They're not just content with one country style park or two, instead they want to see their whole city surrounded by and located in a lush green tropical forest garden.

Enter Gardens by the Bay which is state of the art, cutting edge, futuristic nature park. The purpose is not just eye candy picnic basket recreational but highly educational too. Their aim is to improve quality of life by making people see that trees, plants, flowers, rain, clouds and us humans are all part of nature and cannot function without one another. And to support, they have provided high tech live visual demonstrations, artificial indoor environment, greenhouse conservatories, glass domes, artistic sculptures, animated movies, supertrees and exotic plants from all over the world.

And it's all built and designed with sustainability in mind. Because you can't create environmental awareness by damaging the ecosystem. The whole complex is energy efficient and self sufficient. Its main distinctive structure the tall super trees are multitasking robots that have many jobs to do. They act as solar panels for indoor lighting,  it's roofs collect rainwater, recycle it to be reused for fountains, waterfalls etc. They also serve as giant lungs for all the forests inside as well as exhaust vents to let the steam out and output minimum waste."
Gardens by the Bay,4,The sakuras are at their last stretch. Go quick if you intend to enjoy them!
Gardens by the Bay,5,I came here many times. Never get bored. My favourite place
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This was the best part of visiting Singapore! Gardens are absolutely stunning and amazing! We decided to go before sunset and enjoy, and after stayed for night light show."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A romantic and wonderful place for a stroll in the evening. In my recent walk in the morning, I discovered that the water features need urgent maintenance. The filtration system is probably not working well."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to take a walk if you happen to be around the area but some areas do require tickets so be mindful of that when visiting.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I am really excited to watching so such amazing lanterns here within Chinese Medium-Autumn Festival this year. Full of Chinese atmosphere and culture, it is really so good for me foreigner whom can't back hometown to reunion with my family!! I am very appreciate it!!"

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Been here many times but always a different experience. Here to soak in the Christmas feeling since cannot travel overseas this year due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.
Especially enjoyed the cool weather & fresh air inside the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest Dome."
Gardens by the Bay,5,The flowers does change according to the theme. Some parts are just static. But nice to see sakura when you cannot travel out. It makes you feel that you are out of the country for a while
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Been there many times and still it is a great place to be with family. Besides the world's largest glass greenhouse Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. After a scenic walk on the walkway linking the Super Trees. Grab a seat  below the SuperTree, lay a picnic mat on the spacious ground below at night for the light show display at the Supertree Grove is a night of awesomeness."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Wonderful experience! Not to be missed!
Gardens by the Bay,5,I loved the evening lights here for mid autumn festival. Got to see lots of pretty lanterns and other decorations. It was a lot of fun.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"interesting tourist city,, be careful using your camera in singapore"
Gardens by the Bay,5,This is a great place to jog or cycle after midnight. Better still if you're doing it during the Ghost Festival or Halloween. Spooky but beautiful as hell. Pun intended.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visited Gardens by the bay for the full experience recently. As a Singaporean, I'm amazed and proud about what Singapore has/can achieve! Flower dome was so-so for me, but cloud dome though, really another level ... Feels like youre traveling to another world. Remember to bring a jacket if you're going in the evening though. It's cold!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place for family outing. Nice flowers!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautifully decorated scenery and romantic place to visit with family and loved ones. The Christmas lighting were extremely beautiful.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Morning visit is DA BESTTTT. No one around, free to roam wherever without kids screaming and shouting. Every plant and flower you see is yours for the pic taking. No need to line up whatsoever. Highly recommended to come 830am."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I finally managed to walk around the surrounding (not the paid gardens) and had so much fun looking at the diverse vegetation, different landscapes and some iconic buildings from afar. It was so beautiful and I finally don’t feel trapped like in the confined areas, not that the imported plants are not worth watching, it’s worth every penny but I prefer natural fresh air."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"River Hongbao...Beautiful festive decorated, well organised...especially at such a pandemic period.
Like the part on the introduction of Lion Dance.
Friendly ambassador around to help and guide along."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Still as clean and nice since it's opening... Well done
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to test out ur new camera n skills
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Nice place to stroll after a meal at MBS or Satay by the bay. They have their nightly light shows at 745pm and 845pm, quite enjoyable to watch."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Is dog friendly but becareful with all the cyclists. Somehow more crowded during covid with everyone suddenly getting into biking. Also the field at the gardens by the bay on top of the water treatment plant has a pax limit. So people queued to go up. Skipped that and crossed the marina to go around the otherside. Bring a bottle for there are coolers and toilets to load and unload water.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Feeling very nice & refresh. Not willing to leave and have the urge to stay in overnight in such a serene environment filled with fresh air .
Will re-visit .😊👍☺️👍💪"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I visited Garden by the bay with my family and had the best time here.

There are mainly two huge domes which are fully air conditioned, which makes this huge garden one of the biggest man made gardens in world.
It has world's tallest indoor waterfall and that's something great to see as it looks gorgeous inside a dome.

It has thousands of plants and flowers like most people have never seen in daily life and are specially kept here for attraction which gives variety of colors and smell. If you are a garden lover then you must need a whole day to spend time with this garden and fall in love with its beauty.

There are light and music show at the super tree groves at 8pm and other timings.

It’s a place you must visit if you are in Singapore. It’s open all year."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful attractions and scenic views. Currently hosting the mid-autumn festival 2020 light up (until 4 Oct). Expect long queue on weekends!
Gardens by the Bay,5,A place to go for the flower Dome and cloud Dome. Excellent floral exhibition within the Dome. The super tree is also a highlight. This time I try out the mid autumn illumination.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A ""must-see"" place in Singapore. Definitely plan for a day-trip here and see and do EVERYTHING!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,Only go if you really like plants and appreciate it. A cooling place with nice sceneries and colour plants. They do change the displays and seasonal flowers at the flower dome but the cloud forest remains the same after many years.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great variety of flowers to view. There are sakura viewings now, which is the closest we can get to feel like we’re travelling to Japan 😏"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is the part of the garden less visited by most, including ourselves. There is a different auora around this place..so to speak. It gives the vibes of bamboo forest, rustic elegance with clean japanese garden feel, while at the same time, it feels out of Singapore. Simply loved it!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,The flower dome has a lot more interesting items because of the Sukura exhibit this March. The cloud forest is quite bland and hasn't changed much for years.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One and only of it's kind garden in the world. If you wanna enjoy views from skywalk, better get annual membership including cloud forest and flower dome. It will be worth the cost. 2 free shows at gardens by the bay can be viewed at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Celebrate the 1st day of CNY@ Garden by the bay, colorful lighting, wonderful weather,  sea breezing."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"We LOVED the Gardens by the Bay. Aside from all the beautiful displays, wealth of information and nice views of the city, we also enjoyed learning about Singapore's initiative to become a city in a garden. Highly recommended. Definitely buy a ticket to see the Cloud Forest. this was my favourite."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Excellent place. They display show everyday around 7.45 pm. Magnificent display of colours.

While you're at Gardens by the Bay, you can easily walk to MBS, Esplanade and Merlion Park.

Featuring the Sakura 2021 (From Mar 2021) at the Flower Dome."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I love this place. I was in Singapore for a quick visit and spent most to my time there. Especially if you go at night. Beware that the walkway and the observation decks do close early. And the ticketing booth for both closes even before the last entry. Plan at least one hour before closing to get in one of the attractions. Other than that, plan for a fun time, lots of photo opportunities and some great light shows."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Pretty domes and great ambience. Can get a little cooling as both are air conditoned. Do bring along a jacket or cardigan. My folks were freezing especially with the rainy weather this season. Overall, good to take a stroll in"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Family time with my lovely person when we past the year, see u when I see you SG 😚, h+1 in sg I nosebleed haha i think its happen coz l awesome lmao🤣"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Every visit brings joy in seeing the flowers and the refreshing atmosphere at the Flower and Cloud Dome.
Gardens by the Bay,3,"Find it actually to expensive to enter. If you dont buy Both the tickets together, the Cloud Forest is actually 50% cheaper to enter than the Flower side.... and i find it not that good to actually charge a tourist higher Price than a Singaporean. 1 entry , but 2 prices."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Human genius combines with the wonders of nature to create this unparalleled site.

Located on the edge of the city and overlooking the mouth of the Singapore River, Gardens by the Bay provide a sensational setting.  Stroll along the quiet paths, discover the architectural feats and marvel at the two domes filled with greenery and the ""Supertrees"", created from scratch by man.

Culminating at 50 meters and dominating the whole of the park, the artificial trees are the main attraction of these gardens.  They are lined with several hundred species of orchids, bromeliads, ferns, and tropical flowers.  Last hour visitors will have the chance to witness ""Garden Rhapsody"", a majestic sound and light show.  An elevator nestled in the heart of a tree trunk will propel you to a terrace which will give you a breathtaking view.

The two other top attractions in the park are the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.  In the Flower Dome, you will escape the ambient humidity of Singapore for a moment.  Reproducing the temperate climate of the Mediterranean and other regions of the world, this dome is full of surprising plants from all over the world.  Stroll through the baobabs and olive trees, passing by the cactus corner and the Flower Field, an ever-changing space.  The Cloud Forest offers a whole new universe.  Although also temperate, this dome reproduces a humid and tropical mountain climate and is home to the most vertiginous covered waterfall in the world.  Climb to the top before slowly descending down the winding paths lined with carnivorous plants and orchids, then cross the crystal gallery.

Outside, several kilometers of hiking trails crisscross the park, leading to eclectic spaces.  Some themed gardens feature rare tropical species and various sublime flowers.  Embark on a guided tour to discover all their secrets.

Gardens by the Bay are located next to the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel.  Four parking lots, free between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., are open to the public.  Outside these hours, their access is chargeable.  To get to Gardens by the Bay by public transport, take a bus or metro and get off at Bayfront station, located at the Dragonfly Bridge.  The Gardens by the Bay are open daily.  Access to the terrace and the domes is chargeable."

Gardens by the Bay,4,"There are lots of different restaurants and places you can go to like starbucks, mcdonalds, and more. Every night there is a light show at 9 pm. The huge trees there all light up into different colours and patterns while soothing music plays. There is also a huge field you can go to during the light show to enjoy it with more space. You can also have fun playing things like frisbee, football or whatever you like. I rate this place a solid 4 stars."

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Such a spectacle in the middle of city, well done Singapore.
The gardens offer such an oasis and invitation to nature in the busiest part of Singapore financial and commercial area.
Both the domes highlight the importance of protecting Mother Nature in a cool and fascinating way.
I would go in the evening when it is cooler, see everything in the light. Then when it is dark enjoy the mesmerising light show."

Gardens by the Bay,4,"What a unique experience, this place is definitely out of this world, one of a kind. Worth a visit. There are a lot of attractions that are probably worth buying the combination passes. We bought a ticket to one attraction which was over quickly and not totally worth the money. Regardless, you can enjoy this place and multiple gardens without spending any money. No shortage of places to take a photo."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice place to jog and for children.
Gardens by the Bay,5,A place where everyone can enjoy...
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the most modern gardens you will ever visit. Highly recommended to visit the flower dome and cloud forest.

There is also a large lake and lots of paths you can stroll along.

Nearest mrt: Bayfront
Recommended attire: Long pants or long sleeves for flower dome as the air conditioning is quite strong"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice environment to walk and relax in the morning
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Due to Covid, River Hongbao is at GBTB instead of Marina Floating Platform"

Gardens by the Bay,4,A strategic way of adding a modern greenhouse and a traditional park at the heart of land-scare busy city of Singapore. Truely remarkable.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice place 🌸🌻🌼🌳🌴🌿
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are quite an amazing work of engineering. There is quite a good collection of unique and interesting plants from the Mediterranean, African and Latin American regions in the Flower Dome. Do set aside at least 45mins for each conservatory to best appreciate and enjoy the displays."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A favorite destination. Even more special during the holidays with a carousell and the walk of lights this December 2020.
Great for flying kites and picnic too."

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Almost no one around during weekdays.
Enjoyable walk and great place for somewhat nature walk."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"THIS PLACE IS AN ACTUAL GEM. Harmonising the beautiful fauna, and the various interactive wildlife stations, this attraction truly encapsulates the heart of singapore.
One would easily spend the entire day just exploring this massive area, with wondrous sights that would titillate all the senses! If there’s an attraction, in Singapore that would appeal to all in the family, then this would surely be it ! All in all, an amazing and enriching experience at gardens by the Bay!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A beautiful, and well planned urban garden. There are many things to see, and places to stop at and just appreciate the architect's balance of nature vs. nurture. There are quite a few spots to catch beautiful pictures, and admire the Singapore cityscape. A brisk walking loop takes just over an hour. Lots of water points and toilets along the way. The children's water play-area is definitely a hit with the younger kids."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Went there for the mid autumn festival decorations. Really beautiful with the backdrop of MBS and the super-trees. A true Singapore icon.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Very beautiful garden with many interesting plants and animals. It is also located in a prime location as it is only a 5 minutes walk from Bayfront MRT. It also features many art  pieces such as the Airmesh, the Floral clock and the floating baby. This gardeb also leads you directly to the cloud forest and flower dome.

Would recommend if you enjoy taking serene walks in an environment surrounded by flora and fauna."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the Beautiful place in Singapore. Full day should be allotted to feel the garden completely. Each and every part has its own speciality. Do check the pictures being shared.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Always end up buying a plant from the gift shop! Great selection of healthy plants. They also teach you how to care for your plants when you bring them home. Great service!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Likes a magic wonderland by night.
Magnificent flower dome. A garden worth to visit!"

Gardens by the Bay,5,The Only place in Singapore that you can get to see such beautiful flowers...
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great spot for enjoying beautiful landmarks such as the supertrees and mbs. Bring snacks and definitely drinks as there's not many food options here other than satay by the bay and a couple fast food restaurants which are pricier and crowded. There's water cooler here to top up water bottles which is handy given how hot Singapore is. Daily light shows at the supertree grove at 7.45 and 8.45.
Gardens by the Bay,4,Flower Drome during the day and River Hong Bao at night
Gardens by the Bay,4,A very nice place.

Will I come back here.  No."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Satay Food court open for breakfast from 8:00. Delicious fresh mango.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is a must to go place in singapore!

At night 7:30-8 PM opera music plays and there is a light show which happens only for 15-20 mins but those 20 mins will me more than enough for lifetime memories.

Gardens by the Bay,5,Enjoyed afternoon biking along the coastline.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Think in the future, our planet becomes extremely hostile or uninhabitable for mankind consequence of global warming or other climate changes. Will we be destroyed forever or yet our unimaginable dreams, indomitable will, and hope will keep us alive forever?
""The garden by the bay Singapore"" sharpens all these thoughts of ours..."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Love it. Great park to walk your dog and enjoy the scenary.
Gardens by the Bay,5,The Gardens that always i want to go and  will never bores!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Visited in the night. Great place to walk and take in the landscape
Gardens by the Bay,5,Must visit place in Singapore. Loved the time spent here. Would visit this place multiple times during my stay here in Singapore. You can roam around park by enjoying the multiple ecosystem they have created manually. Here the center of attraction is The light show that happens at 8 everyday near the Super Tree. It's too good. You can visit the Cloud Forest and Butterfly dome also. These two are very good to enjoy the natural beauty.
Gardens by the Bay,5,We had a fantastic day here the place is beautiful! We didn't go into any of the domes but enjoyed walking around and the light show in the evenings is fantastic. I would recommend taking plenty of water as drinks are fairly expensive there.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place for dogs and humans 😊
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful! Such a cool walk after a storm in the afternoon!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I dunno why my family absolutely love coming to this 'magical' place again & again.

There are absolutely so many things to see, discover & bond inbetween gawking at the colourful flora, fauna & exploring little nooks for instagrammable worthy pics!

There are both paid & free gardens. Both equally magical.

Just dun go during the scorching afternoons or ull literally feel like 'melting' frm the heat of the asphalt!

Jacket is a must for the elderly whn exploring the Cloud Dome. Venturing into the top most level of the waterfall is absolutely breath taking.

Meandering around the slopes in the Flower Forest is so much fun!

U can then end ur visit craning ur neck to view the super trees as a finale. Night time during the light show is the best. Make sure u come a tad early to 'chope' the best seat under the stars...."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice & peaceful place to visit
Gardens by the Bay,2,"Location: Flower Dome and Cloud Forest
The care and maintenance of the plants is not as good as before, comparing to as far back as when it just opened and as near as two years ago. The plants look tired, lack vibrancy and probably dehydrated. And  the glass panels are not clean."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Was at the outdoor park and took a walk from Gardens by the Bay to Marina Barrage. The garden is not crowded and is a great place to spend a leisurely Sunday.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing greenhouse domes with wide variety of flora and plant species.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Came here during christmas few years ago , its so beautiful ! The lights is so cool !"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful are found from up close to far away. Thank you, managers and staff Flower Garden Dome who made this beautiful experience possible. 😁"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I loved the experience at Gardens by the bay. I actually purchased a ticket at the airport, including Floral Fantasy, Flower dome and Cloud Forest. Cloud Forest was whimsical. Love it. The outside area is beautiful too, and at night the music show at the Supertree groove is a must. Recommended time to be there and enjoy the experience should be around 5 pm."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"must seeing destination in Singapore! beautiful during the day and night!

i love this place during the day and even more during the night with all the lights ON.

I prefer to come for the light show around 20.00 or at night around 00.00 am since it wont be crowded.

It has some attraction to visit as well. The easiest way to reach by the bayfront mrt or taxi.

Its free entrance so dont worry about that!

Enjoy your day!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Long overdue review for this place. A modern garden in the city's Southern region sandwiched in between Marina Bay Sands resort and Marina Barrage. Amenities include but not limited to public toilets, rain shelters, food courts, restaurant, two gigantic seashell shaped greenhouses, golf carts/trams, etc. Family/children friendly. Was here on the last day of mid autumn festival 2020 for the lights installations. It was lackluster due to covid-19 situation, however safety-distancing measures were generally well implemented. Place can get very humid due to proximity to nearby sea."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice place to visit during CNY
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the iconic structure and a main tourist attraction in Singapore.
Light show starts around 7:30 pm and it's FOC. Food outlets(only 1 indian) are available with slightly high priced.
But everything was shutdown during  covid-pandemic."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I love this place. I feel so in touch with nature,seeing different types of flowers and other botanical plants."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Stunning place, amazing garden"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Be there when it gets dark. The music and light show is unbelievable. Once in a lifetime experience. Well, actually it was so good we went two nights running!😍"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very big garden. Good for nice walk and jogging
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Gardens by the Bay, is an amazing park with almost all species of all plant & flowers on display under huge domes or glass houses with climate control.

In the evenings there are spectacular Light shows at the Gardens by the Bay. The show duration is 15 minutes.

Also, Cloud Forest, where a dramatic waterfall and mountain cloaked in vegetation, is very eye catching."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Singapore is Garden City. Love My Country.  Nice Garden with lots of Flowers and it changed different Various Kind of flower during the different Seasons.  😀💖💖
Gardens by the Bay,5,Flower dome is a nice place to bring kids :D pretty flowers and nice ambience.. weekday visits are good for taking photos..
Gardens by the Bay,5,Relaxing garden. The highlights are the two conservatories and super trees.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visited Cloud Forest and Gardens domes. Both very interesting, and nice to enjoy cooler temperatures. However, the light show with music is the real highlight. Absolutely spectacular and memorable. This is our second time here. Absolutely essential thing to see."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Have always love visitng Gardens by the Bay whenever I back in Singapore
Gardens by the Bay,5,"We're Friends of the Garden for a reason.

Wonderful place to wind down."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to being your children.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is a wonderfully beautiful place.  I didn’t even go into the paid exhibits because we only had a couple hours.  But all of the outside gardens were gorgeous and since it was hot and humid out, we took a couple breaks in the shade. I would have loved to have come back at night when all of the lights were on because I can imagine how lovely they would be then."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice place for walking.
Gardens by the Bay,5,I love the place so much. The conservatories have beautiful botany and the event decorations look amazing
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Very exciting place. With sky bridge, flower garden, and egg river. It is so beautiful to come here with your family.

Even in the night, you will see light attraction of this place and will see beautiful night scenery of singapore from sky bridge.

Never boring to come to this place for the second and third time."
Gardens by the Bay,4,A nice place to take a leisurely stroll in the garden and for birding watching.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"My favourite place to go to especially when I’m off on weekdays, as it is less crowded. The two domes are always nice and cool, which is great when the weather in Singapore can get unbearably hot. Or if you don’t mind the heat, the outdoor garden is pretty nice too. But personally I would recommend to check out the outdoor garden in the morning when it is cooler."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Always feel good to re-visit this park. Meticulously designed to integrate water (pond) features (foutains, sculptures, installations, rocks, special themed features such as floats, lanterns, figurines etc) with beautiful landscape. Although all are artificial but smartly placed and designed."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Just signed up for annual membership. Support domestic tourism.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Fav hangout place. Check it out!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must go to place in Singapore. They use renewable energy to run this park. There is this huge man made waterfalls, lots of different kinds of plants and flower species. You can go all the way up to the top of the canopy. And guess what? The place is air-conditioned! Then walk along the walkway going to Marina Bay Sands which is one of Singapore's iconic structure!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Green and clean! Good for photo lovers.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gardens by the bay is incredible. The light show is completely free and its amazing in the evening. However you can visit by day and I would suggest doing both.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Must to visit this place, it’s wonderful architecture and structures, the garden is so beautiful, specially when you walked between these massive trees. Very touristic place we lot of things to do and explore, I walked in different gardens and green area, very friendly people, local restaurants and cafes. Extremely clean and playground for kids."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is one of the best attractions I have been too not only in Singapore but in the world! Was an amazing day out inside the domes is lovely and air conditioned maybe actually you might need a jacket it’s quite chilly! Wondering the gardens is nice but can be quite hot!

The tree light show was worth the wait.

Would highly recommend this place for couples, families or solo travellers! A great day had by all"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice tranquil place. Peaceful. Gives you a good feeling with nature.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Night time in here. Nice place for couple mingle around. A lot of beautiful scenery.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Very nice place to visit have supertrees, have experience inside two Dome and also have satay by the bay can eat."
Gardens by the Bay,5,No words can describe the way this garden is built. The musical show in the evening is one of the best i have ever seen.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"I love the plants n flowers and the way they are displayed. Walking through The Dome and Cloud Garden gives me the feel that am overseas in a park, in a cooler country."

Gardens by the Bay,4,Felt good to get out and roam around for a while. Not many people present. It's actually really quiet!!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Simply, purely amazing place! You haven't been to Singapore if you haven't visited Gardens by the Bay period. I recommend taking a day time tour first and then evening one - it's a whole different experience 😊"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice place to visit and relax when it’s not crowded
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Came here with my Girlfriend, it's a really nice place.
Not gonna lie, it's a place that spells bliss."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The ambience of the gardens was more than words can say, the magnificent trees draped in lights was breathtaking.  The fireworks display...exquisite! The flowers😍😍😍 out of this world. I definitely would love to go back....

The giant light draped trees are best seen at night😉😉"
Gardens by the Bay,5,love love loved it!!!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A beautiful piece of man-made greenery in the city centre of Singapore. Staff here are extremely friendly and helpful, I recently purchased the Friends of the Garden membership so I'm looking forward to coming back here more often. A little upset that the complimentary shuttle is no longer available for members. But the $3 unlimited ride for a day isn't too bad."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Delighted that the domes are open once again. My husband and I have year-long passes there and we enjoy popping to look at all the gorgeous plants.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lucky to visit this in March before the shutdown. This is the Singaporean best answer to city beautification. IMHO, it's totally worth the price of entrance to see the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Supertree Grove and the many themed botanical gardens inside."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Since there is no way to travel out for now, have been re-exploring places I haven't been to for awhile in Singapore... As always there is something new to discover...crowd control this time is very well organised. More chance for taking photos."

If you are visiting here, I hope you will enjoy the trip! 😊"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing beautiful place to family holiday in Singapore
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The place is a must visit but it comes to life only at the night. Single most important suggestion - follow the sign posts at the garden. Don't follow Google maps. It will take you through a very long route.

Try coming from the Marina shopping center side and get the view from the top for free."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place. But you must bring sun protection lotion because you might get burned. Weather was good.

It’s easy to find. From Marina Bay Sand shopping mall true the garden. I love the place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Very special place with unique atmosphere! Huge area of jungle-looked place. Enormous amounts of plants,flowers and trees. Thousands of lamps lighted the way and some installations.  Many sculptures. Definitely it's not enough to visit it in day time or only at night, you should try both, to feel all the unforgettable experience!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The largest nature park in Singapore, you will enjoy a walk through it whether early in the morning or evening because of its beautiful ponds, bridges, sculptures, trees.."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful place and obviously a must-go in Singapore. Recommend to go sometime between 8pm-9pm when it gets dark- completely different experience.  Make sure to walk around the entire garden. Its easy to miss parts of the garden because its so large.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"By far the most amazing place in Singapore! The evening light show is magical and it’s also lovely to walk around the gardens during the day. The Domes are a must-visit too, and overall GBB is such a beautiful highlight of Singapore. Recommend pre-purchasing your tickets to not wait in line too long."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Really beautiful.
Everyone should visit here if they come to Singapore.
The night show was ultimate."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Most magical at night but also spectacular in the day. Singapore's special garden in the city will definitely not fail to please.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Just awesome... The light show e ceeded expectations with an amazing visual display... Co ordinated with a beautiful selection of classic songs. Remember there are only shows at 7.45 and 8.45 pm.. So get there early to enjoy the free show
Gardens by the Bay,5,The cloud dome is very pretty and a good place to visit. If you aren't much interested in attending low key carnival then don't buy tickets for Christmas wonderland it's $10 but I didn't find it much appealing. The flower dome and cloud dome are very beautiful and picturesque.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Breathtaking no matter how many times we visited😍😍😍
Gardens by the Bay,5,Superb place.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful place to take pictures and to spend the day and night

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Spectacular garden with free access except the two futuristic buildings inside that come with a fee (Flower Dome & Cloud Forest).

Words cannot describe the care, the planning, the high level of creativity in all aspects of Gardens by the Bay. I highly recommend this park"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very nice place to visit... my family live it...
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing place! The scenery was like food for the eyes. I can stay there all day and admire the beauty of the garden and the surroundings. The light show was superb.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Very large garden (101 hectares). Some people doing sports here, running, and cycling. Well worth to visited. Many destinations inside, the garden consists of 3 waterfront garden.
The pass ticket at least for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are definitely not to miss."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place with many more sections. Cloud forest, flower garden, evening fountain music light show etc etc. Fully solar power operated.  Must visit after sunset to see the decorated lights."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best and peaceful place to visit in Singapore. If are ok with walking you can enjoy the plants and colours of flower. Well maintained park with lots of spacious and nice fragrance. Only suggestion is carry your water bottle or you won’t get here and there.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice and quiet in the morning.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"What can I say, If you riches, you can create your own tourist attractions.

Recommended time to visit this place is before 3 pm.  You go to visit other parks and places first, and before 6pm you should already back on the near those garden towers.

Take a rest, order some food or drinks in the food court. Around 7pm you will be presented with musical and lighting show by the Gardens."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Tranquil and healing
Gardens by the Bay,4,Cloud forest is cooling and beautiful.
Gardens by the Bay,5,🌸 Beautiful flowers 🌸
Gardens by the Bay,5,Look closely .. how in the world the sculpture floats...
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Thic Singapore iconic place is a must visit. Gardens by the bay has its free area and area who requires payment. To enjoy the nice melody with dancing fountain here is free, people love this place, so do I."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Much effort has been spent in building this beautiful park. Without buying any tickets, I still enjoyed the scenery of the Marina Bay areas. The weather was very warm on that day and there were only few shading areas. After all, some exposure to sunlight is good to one's health. However, on a rainy day, you need to bring an umbrella with you."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to enjoy the scenery and exhibits
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares (250 acres) in the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden (in Marina South), Bay East Garden (in Marina East) and Bay Central Garden (in Downtown Core and Kallang). The largest of the gardens is the Bay South Garden at 54 hectares (130 acres) designed by Grant Associates. Its Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Awesome! Words are not enough to describe so better come and feel it see it in reality
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A magnificent surprise but seems night show is more impressive. The super tree structures dominate the Gardens' landscape, the whole Gardens by the Bay area is a great place to be with more things to do and very well worth visiting, you need to have a day to cover all the attractions"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Experience of a lifetime.It a marvel of engineering feat.It poses one of the must & most visited spots in Singapore.
Entry is free.But its best to reach there by 7 pm,in order to experience the Light Show which occurs daily.
Its an out of the world experience,as if the whole are just bursts into life."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best park in Singapore! A must visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Fantastic place to visit, great views, even better PLANTS! The wide diversity of plants on view is just breath taking, whole days can be spent here with no sense of wasted time. This is one place that I will revisit!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"flower done opened, need advance booking. went for FOG friends of Garden yearly pass. cheaper and easy to book visit slots...but the free 2hrs carpark didn't kick in yet..."
Gardens by the Bay,5,always make me Happy when I see the flowers.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place to walk and relax. Beautiful in both day and night. Do look out the the free light show at the supertrees in the evening.

Perfect place to take photos too! Personally took graduation shots here."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing place to walk around especially in the evening, obviously go check out the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. But the sky trees are spectacular worth a visit in the evening especially for the lights. Plenty of paths and all accessible to get around if you can stand the heat!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely stunning!
One of the ""must go"" places for tourists. Love the lights and music. It's free entertainment show for everyone)) lay down on the ground, sit or stand doesn't matter, important is watching this lively scenery and enjoy as much as you can :)

Go up to the tree as well if you want )) but you gotta pay for this."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful tourist attraction. Wonderful light and sound show in the evening. As the name suggest, it is indeed fully man made gardens  by the bay side . Amazing piece of art with enormous varieties of plants and gardens everywhere beautifully laid and planned. Carry plenty of fluids with you as one tends to get tired and thirty . One has many attractions inside the gardens by the bay some being free and for some one needs to purchase tickets for.you can book the tickets online to avoid the long queues and save on time."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"You must stop by here if you’re in Singapore. The walk will take around 2 hours but it is very worth it. If you’re a photographer then bring your camera - there will be plenty of good shots to capture. Really a must visit if you’re here, I pretty much come here almost every time I visit Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Top attraction in Singapore. Must see!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place around the city. It is an ultimate setup of a garden. It has two dens full of various Plants, Trees, shrubs etc. It has an ultimate mountain setup which u can experience inside it and around it as well. The air is really fresh and make us feel plesant. The maintanence of garden is excellent. They also organise various point of interest. The tree towers Is really gigantic. I suggest to visit them at night. It is really colourful. The lights dances along with the song which gives us a new experience..!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,best all around garden ...
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Wow amazing, a must go in Singapore. Both night and day you’ll find the magic by the bay.
Indoor oasis to get close to the nature.
Artificial lights structures and material well integrated into the natural beauty of plants, how amazing !!!
Spend a day or two here to go slow and feel the breeze!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This special event ""Walk of lights"" only available from 4 - 27 Dec. Remember to purchase the ticket  online. Totally worth it if you wanna have some good memories with loves one."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Light show was spectacular. Be on time at 745pm or 845pm to enjoy the full show
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very nice place. You can take fresh oxygen inside the garden. This is one of the man made largest flowers and trees collection in the world. You must visit this place at evening or night to see the actual beauty of the garden.
Gardens by the Bay,4,a bit hot to walk outside...
Gardens by the Bay,5,This indoor garden just blew my mind away! I had never seen such a thing in my life until I visited this place. Every plant and every display is so perfect. I can tell the workers there take care of them with love. Coming here during Christmas gave us a different experience too due to season's greetings and display.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place to visit. It is at a really nice place and there is a lot to see, make sure you don't miss the cloud and flower dome"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A very surreal experience! A must visit when in Singapore. Never skip the Cloud Forest, Flower dome and especially the Flower Fantasy exhibit! There is an open field right below the super trees where people can watch as the supertrees lights up at night."
Gardens by the Bay,4,This place is very well done though it looks large it can be visited in few hours. There is not much to keep you entertained or relaxed rather it gives let me get this done so I can go to next attraction kind of feeling. But as a tropical city and Singapore’s commitment to environmental sustainability this place showcase its plant diversity and richness of the country. It is definitely a place worthwhile to visit once.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice with many colourful CNY lions
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Definitely visit here, you will see how Singapore nailed the greening. Highly recommended go visit in the moring and evening, try to avoid the noon time because of the big sun in Singapore. There is light show every day at 7:45pm and 8:45 pm, if you buy the sky bridge ticket, please go to book the time if you plan to go there after 6pm."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Nice, futuristic, clean, beautiful park. Open and free entry for all.

Only complain is it's too hot and humid in Singapore weather but if it's raining, there is no shelter and you can't walk around anymore.

Dank smell near the man made pond. Smells exactly like the green + brown algae in the pond, if you walk just by it.

Good sculptures in and around. The glass sculpture area is ticketed entrance only so if you want to enter, you will need to purchase tickets.

Challenge: Try and find the giant baby."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Latest flowers, growing apples, oranges, grapes, lemon, edible plants& flowers..."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Excellent, a must see attraction if you are in Singapore. We’ve been to a few botanical gardens around the world and this is right up there with the best of them.
As with the rest of the city, everything in the Gardens is meticulously cared for and there isn’t a single palm leaf out of place.
We only intended on spending an hour or two here, but ended up spending 5 or 6 hours as the gardens are huge and the greenhouses massive. Remember to take good walking shoes as you will need them.
The outside gardens however are very hot as there is not much shade so make sure you pack water and an umbrella before you head off from the visitors centre as you could be walking quite a way before you get a chance to get water again.
The sky tree observatory gives great views of the entire Gardens, but if you only have enough money for one attraction, make sure it’s the Cloud dome, it’s great!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing place to hang on. Recommend to go during evening, so that you can visit the garden and see the beautiful lights when the sun goes down. If you also want to visit indoor gardens, which are amazing, plan your day little early during day. There would be big crowd and q, esp in holidays."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"If you are a fan of local flora or even just appreciate nature this place is out of this world! I have never been to a better maintained garden with this amount of plant life diversity. The park is sectioned into different categories with two large domes, one with the Cloud forest, a large indoor waterfall ecosystem with a man-made mountain outfitted with tropical plants and the other dome is a Flower dome with an abundance of flowers in different colours. The domes cost extra to enter while the park itself is free.  There is also a tree walk where you can walk through the man-made trees and enjoy the park from above. This is a work of landscape architectural genius, something that Singapore always does brilliantly! If you are in the area please make this a stop on your list!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Went early Sat morning before any potential crowds. Nice walk and even my two year old son enjoyed running around. Note: the domes can be a bit chilly so bring something to warm yourself up.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Every time I go to Singapore, I make sure to visit this place as it is so beautiful and the ambiance, vibes it gives is unbeatable. One should definitely visit this place if visiting Singapore for the first time. I am sure you 'll fall in love with this place.

It is a man-made nature park located in the heart of the city featuring-
* an indoor 35m waterfall,
* almost 30k plants of over 150 species in 9 different gardens from 5 continents of the worlds,
*Supertree Grove- vertical gardens home to over 150k plants

** Free light and sound show at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Place that you bring your family to hang around on weekend. Thoes likes flowers will enjoy this trip .. amazing setup 😍. I spent the whole day there its amazing experience . Morning i hang around at supertree grove for brid watching its amazing too see them ..
Gardens by the Bay,5,We explored the cloud forest during a rainy afternoon in Singapore. It was the perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon. The clouds eventually cleared and we walked around outside too. A beautiful park and tourist attraction!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Excellent place to visit in Singapore. I really loved it. Please be informed that, if you want to check out the whole park, you have to walk a lot. Though they have a bus tour, but it's only available once an hour. The weather is very hot so be ready to sweat a lot."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Nice and big park to explore, pretty crowded in the evening if not during the Pandemics."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Go in the morning, less crowded. Cloud forest still the best
Cooling and relaxing."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Really suitable for exercise. Alot of stairs to start with. Recommended to go during night time. Becauseee hehehe you will see. Got song and stuff makes the place looks majestic. :)
Gardens by the Bay,5,"IMO, cloud forest is more nicer than flower dome. The day view and night view is totally different too."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"super love the vibes but a lot of people during the weekends, better to go there during weekdays :)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the most popular experiences in Singapore. The place has a huge collection of beautiful flowers as well as a huge vertical garden. There is an accessible skywalk through which you can view the entire garden. The light show happen at 7:45 and 8;45 daily and is free of cost. They have a decent cafe inside as well. There are variety of shows which run during scheduled periods. Do visit to be enthralled by the lights and music.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Love everything in here. Cozy, beautiful and relax place. 1 day exploring is never enough for me. Night time is my favourite time to spend in here."
Gardens by the Bay,5,This really was an Amazing experience. You need more than a half a day to cover the entire area. It is better to take the Golf cart Ride first. Then you would be able to locate the places you want to visit. However we felt that the ticket issue for the Garden Rhapsody at the super tree grove would have been organised in a better and a efficient manner. But it was an unforgettable experience to be on the top of all those man made super trees which illuminates to the music.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Well maintained flower garden with seasonal decorations
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Must-see when in Singapore! Wonderful atmosphere, especially during the night. Make sure to see the lightshow - daily at 19.45 and 20.45. It lasts 15 minutes. Make sure to be a bit earlier (20 minutes before start to get a good seat). And then sit back, relax and enjoy the show!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"A Rainy Monday Afternoon...
Decided to visit the Christmas decorations at Gardens by the Bay.

#gardenbythebay #christmas #elf #decorations"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Biggest park in Singapore. With 2x indoor air-conditioned Cloud and Forest domes
Gardens by the Bay,5,A place where you can unwind❤
Gardens by the Bay,5,Lovely visit great day/evening out. Plenty to see and do. Surprisingly the food prices are very good considering they have captured audience. The two centre tropical houses could have had more colourful flowers as they are very much the same but the fantasy gardens cover this all be it at an extra cost. The Xmas  combined cost was 38 $sing excellent value.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Artwork by Dale Chihuly
Gardens by the Bay,4,Its beautiful went first time
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Seriously, it’s amazing there. I have too much to say about this place.

Everything is good there!

Small tips:

1. if you are flying with Singapore Airlines, remember to bring your boarding pass because there’s a 10% off Conservatories admission (includes Flower Dome and Cloud Forest).

2. Remember to have a stamp on your hand at the exit before you leave any of the gardens since the stamp is ticket allows you to renter."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Ever wondered what a sci-fi garden city would ever look like? You may want to try immersing your 5 senses at Gardens by the Bay! What makes it stunning in the day is equally breathtaking at night! Sadly I only managed to explore it in the day. It was well worth it. 😁 Come on down and take a relaxing stroll through this magnificent man-made superstructure!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Serene place to spend an evening, awesome structures with great lighting. Get to here with metro or bus. Great cleanliness, you could see some otters while you walk down the lane, great spots for photos."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Reduced operations due to COVID situation during our last visit. Anyway one of the best places to visit in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely surreal!!! My cruiseship embarked from Singapore. I felt retroactively bad that I only spent one day in beautiful Singapore. I should have arrived a week earlier to thoroughly absorb all of of the amazingly sites of this ridiculously clean and tropical Island nation!!! The country is a veritable jewel, including Gardens by the Bay!!!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,The garden is best and fun place to learn nature in the world.  I have visited twice but I would like to visit here again. Cos we can learn something to think our nature and life from here.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The view here is otherworldly, and reminds me of the movie Avatar. They have a wide assortment of rare plants here, topped with some futuristic-looking gigantic trees. Located by the Marina Bay Waterfront in the heart of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay is a sanctuary for nature lovers and budding horticulturalists alike. It is definitely a spot tourists must visit during their trips to Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Really pretty and it opens from 5am to 2am!! But not EVERYTHING is open. The gardens stay open but the walkway, observatory, and things inside a building are closed at 9pm last ticket at 8 or 8:30."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful ambience , especially if you love natural environment.
It was a part of our tour but it was worth going. It is quite big , so you have to be prepared to walk. The domes are must to see as they offer you hundreds of different varieties of flora. There is also a night and sound show (we couldn't see that ). If you need there are shuttles and rent cycles available. You can spend the day here without getting bored in the enriching atmosphere. There are lots of places to rest and refresh.

In short a great place with lots to see and experience."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the best place in singapore for a leisurely walk, enjoying the beautiful flowers and trees.. the theme gets changed every few months, so be sure to get a membership so you can come unlimited times a year. I come by at least 5 times each year thumbs up for all the hard work by the staff ensuring the plants are happy and radiant."
Gardens by the Bay,5,It is a place for family to spend time together . I loved it
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing plants and beautifully done up.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing place. Well maintained and organized. Suitable for all ages and would definitely recommend tourists to visit this place and immerse in the garden city experience here. Buggy ride would be recommended as walking from one enclosure to the other can take up to 10minutes and it will be tiring under the hot afternoon sun. Cloud forest is a must go! Would recommend to spend around 3/4 of your day here and come early to avoid the crowd and long queues :)
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very attractive views!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Visited during Christmas week . Awesome place .
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This Year's (2019) Poinsettia Wishes was really amazing! The exhibition was air-conditioned and comfortable, and the Christmas decorations were adorable, beautiful and amazing at the same time! Definitely recommended to go if you're a Christmas lover!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The Cloud Forest has an indoor waterfall with beautiful selection or floral and fauna around the exterior structure of it. The Flower Dome has a vast selection of flowers from various parts of the world with special collections added every now and then and the new added dome The Floral Fantasy has that playfulness and artsy designs of floral along the interior of the dome. I am personally not a  enthusiast, but I enjoyed all 3 domes."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Awesome place. The artificial trees look so good and the light show is just awesome. The waterfall is also amazing. It feels so fresh and natural after going to this place. The bridge is also amazing, it feels as if we are in some heavenly place. Must visit place for all the tourists who go to Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Going there from time to time to have some serenity and peace while experiencing nature. Do drop by the Domes, they’re worth a try."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This place is straight out of the future. You can spend hours strolling here and admiring the natural beauty as well as the technological marvels throughout the park. Here you will also find Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, which are well worth the visit. The park has many separate areas with different themes/attractions, such as Supertree Grove, so there's plenty to explore. Coming here at night is also quite spectacular because of the lights and displays."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Best place to visit in Singapore, I can literally spend entire day here. It has two domes cloud some and flower some. Cloud dome is better so visit flower dome first. Also don't miss the light show at Supertree grove in the evening."
Gardens by the Bay,5,As good as usual
Gardens by the Bay,5,What a wonderful place to visit. So much things to sightseeing around there. It's very clean and so well-maintained.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Whats not to love about this incredible park.  The tropics meets avatar meets beauty.  Hire a scooter and enjoy the park and surrounds, there are literally hundreds of kilometres of tracks you can explore from the park. Impeccably maintained and very relaxing."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the main tourist attractions in Singapore this one is definitely worth visiting! Easily accessible via a short walk behind the Marina Bay Sands and you will be in the Gardens. Lots of viewing areas, make sure you got to the path slightly behind to have a raised view and cut the people out of your photos. We didn't pay to go up as we thought the view was better from below as the gardens were the actual view. So lovely free tourist attraction. Lots of other restaurants and sights in the area. They have a light display at night time usually 7:30pm and 8:30pm but worth checking the time beforehand and getting there early to get a good spot to view it!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Lovely and well kept
Gardens by the Bay,5,Favorite place in Singapore! It's free to look at and just incredible! You can pay $8 Singapore dollars to go up and they have a free light show everyday at 7:45pm and 8:45pm! It's incredible!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"By far my favorite experience in Singapore. I highly recommend adding the flower fantasy to your ticket. In my opinion, it was the most beautiful part. At night time they do a light show that is also very cool to watch and is free of charge as long as you do not want to do the skywalk ($8 fee)."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Most delightful visit ! Highly recommend !!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Explore plant life from around the world at Gardens by the Bay...
Gardens by the Bay,5,The domes were beautiful but my favourite had to be the Floral Fantasy exhibition! That was really magical and totally worth the money.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great way to spend an afternoon... Fully air conditioned so you can enjoy, no matter the weather. Nice bar / restaurant inside, so you can get refreshments. Really beautiful views, both inside and out"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"An absolute can't miss in Singapore. My highlight of my recent visit.
gardens by the bay has a real otherworldly feel to it and is really unique. The super trees are a breathtaking site and placed in the centre of a large park - not something you'd expect in the middle of a large city.
It's free to explore (although you'll have to pay if you want to visit the domes) and you can easily spend a day here. There's also a few cafes and a good court called satay by the bay which has lots of food options for a really good price.
Number 1 experience in Singapore and really easy to get to."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The gardens are gorgeous, well maintained and even with lack of navigation skills with all the signs you'll know your way around.
Waited for the night light show at 7:45pm and loved it so much that we stayed for the other one at 8:45 pm too."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Its a very nice place to go outside from your home where you can spend a lots of time with your family and friends. This place is totally neat and clean and fulfilled with green environment. Very nice place to visit fir explore your knowledge
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must visit! The outdoor park is free itself but you have to pay to visit in the indoor gardens. The Cloud Dome was our favourite with the indoor waterfall - it was also a great spot to cool off from the brutal humidity.

The park features are incredible and very photo-worthy! Especially the super trees and the cool egg floaties in the water with view of the Marina Bay Sands in the background."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"How beautifull this place is, good place for visitors, perfect location beside the sea,various activities you can do ,don't forget to see all Singapore from the top of marina bay,  you can go up and just order coffee from the restaurant above and enjoy the view. 👌🏽"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful garden. Great place for an evening jog or walk.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Loved being this forest in the middle of a busy city. Definitely will be going again to visit and finish all the other parts we missed. Beautiful both day and night
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The crew there are friendly and its comfortable touring there. it gives me chills seeing this architecture. Surrounded by temperate nature in the cool conservatory in the heart of Singapore.Explore an extravagant world of flowers at Floral Fantasy, Gardens by the Bay’s newest attraction. The best of the best are the views from the top."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing place. Kids always enjoy it
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Stunning flowers from around the globe!
Amazing types of flowers and fauna and forest!
We spent the entire time walking in and around the place!
Peaceful
We loved this place as one of our top 3 in all of Singapore!
#RockFromRI"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Magnificent wonder of men!  Hard to describe actually.   Easy to get to.  Plan to stay a while and enjoy the night show at 9:00pm
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Biggest garden and iconic interest in singapore, must visit if you go there"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Unique design of the tree tops and surrounding gardens.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A beautiful garden filled with a lot of colours, plants, trees (and super trees) and flowers. Nice place to explore the environment and different species of plants and flowers. A must to experience the Flower and Cloud Domes, but even without them the garden itself is already a really big and nice place to experience. It's also a pretty place for photography for both day and night."
Gardens by the Bay,4,The Christmas display was beautiful.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay! Went here yesterday which was Monday and it was a really fun experience! First we walked through the gardens then decided to buy tickets for a walk on the bridge with the view of the Marina Bay Sands (more commonly known as the hotel which has a huge ship sitting right on top of it), as well as the Singapore Ferris Wheel! The ticket was S$8 and I should say it was worth it! Wait, people come here to visit their domes, don't they? I visited once before but didn't get a chance yesterday to revisit. From how I remember, I love Flower dome the most with Cloud dome being the second. Cloud forest was not bad at all, it was super chilling and the greens really put an ease in the eye. BUT, nothing compares with the experience in the Flower dome. It was incredibly built and all the flowers were amazing. The trees, the beauty of nature. My Singaporean friend ever told me that the display of flowers changes depending on the season. When it's tulip season or sakura season, the displays of flowers change accordingly. Well, it's overall a cool experience!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice Christmas walk!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It's a very beauty park suitable for family with young teen. There's many different culture elements to be seen there.

If you plan to visit the garden in the cloud and the flower garden. Try to arrange to occupied one whole day. There's a good food alley with good local food vender.

The place is a bit hot during noon and the rain can fall in a blink of an eye. So an umbrella is a must have item."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of a best places to visit in Singapore. More beautiful in night time. Can be experienced light shows with music under the trees. Special events in special celebration periods.
Gardens by the Bay,4,One of the popular tourist attraction. Make sure you visit at dusk to enjoy the sunset and also the light & sound show which starts at 7.30pm. Try to secure a nice spot to watch the show before it starts. It's a little crowded.
Gardens by the Bay,4,A place must to visit when you in Singapore. Photo 2019
Gardens by the Bay,5,A must visit location in Singapore… worth getting a room in MBS to get a view of the light and music show
Gardens by the Bay,5,Go to the OCBC walk and watch the sunset. It’s beautiful at night at gardens by the bay. Iconic supertrees that was inspiration for guardians of the galaxy.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"What a day out! The best place to go in Singapore.

I spent the best part of 6 hours there, exploring the gardens and visiting the main attractions. Unfortunately the Flower Dome was closed for maintenance that day but that didn't put a downer on the day at all.

The Cloud Forest is just stunning - it's pretty awe inspiring when you step into the Cloud Forest and are greeted with the waterfall for the first time, but the ways you can explore and navigate the whole area is fantastic - so imaginative.

The rest of the Gardens By The Bay are equally brilliant with outdoor statues and sculptures, and a sky walk across the Supertree Grove.

Easily the must-do thing in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Cloud dome and Flower dome are amazing, world record winning, innovative ecosystem greenhouses. A great scientific example for the world by the country of Singapore. There is a nightly light and music show with the supertrees, that double as renewable energy power sources drawing from biomass, solar photovoltaic cells and rain water. Just amazing, well done Singapore!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Is a MUST visit place if you are first time visiting Singapore, is an iconic place and has a great view (even is artificial). Is free entrance and you can enjoy the show daily at 7.45pm and 8.45pm, for some other like Flower dome / Cloud forest then you opt to pay for the entrance ticket, beware of the crowd if you have kids. Overall we enjoyed these colorful super tree show and took some nice pictures 😁"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Must visit for any tourists to Singapore. The cooled conservatories had very nice collection of plants and flowers. The outdoor garden was fantastic with cool tidbits of information about different cultures. Don't miss the Garden Rhapsody light show at night.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing lightshow in the evening. Also beautiful at Day time. Best place to enjoy the light show is the balcony (downstairs is the restaurant). There is also beautiful garden surrounding the place, where you can have a picnic with you family. Beautiful place. Must see."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place for a walk. Well curated garden offering lovely views.
Gardens by the Bay,5,@cold flowers 🌿
Gardens by the Bay,5,A wonderful night at this place so romantic
Gardens by the Bay,5,Avatar Place.. The best view
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place for a picnic, chill with friends, run or walk around."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Fascinating Gardens of incredible scale and detail! Indoor and elevated areas cost extra but it's free to walk around outside. Well worth paying for the dome attractions!
Gardens by the Bay,4,"A must see attraction on your to do list when in Singapore.
I didn't have to pay any entry fee on Friday but only paid S$5 for the bridge walk which is optional otherwise there were no entry fee.
I like the whole setup and eager to see it after watching the film Agent47 :) I was expecting the light show a bit of point lighting show but it is just like a big Bluetooth speaker with lights.
The music on my was played in 4 languages.
English, Chinese, Urdu and Malay.
You will like for the first time as it is good item to tick of the list. Good luck"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Hands down, the most beautiful, majestic & family-friendly nature park in all of Singapore. Everywhere you look you get an amazing view of the surroundings. It is of course crowded during the weekends but there is more than enough space to accommodate the crowds. Parking is aplenty as well."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Enjoying Gardens by the Bay using NATIONAL Day promotion ticket! Unlimited access for 6 months for Singaporeans! Don’t missed it !
Gardens by the Bay,5,A dreamland on earth.... This has been one of my favourite places I have visited so far the structures of super tree Grove takes to the variety of experience... The cloud forest is like in avatar movie where you'll find something out from earth species of plants and flowers... People who visit Singapore must surely try to visit this and get their mind blown like how I was blown away... I'm not still out of that beautiful amazing place.... Will surely visit once more if I get a chance...
Gardens by the Bay,5,I would have liked to have seen this at night but we were short of time. It is so beautiful there were many more trees than I had expected the flowers are so  beautiful and of course you can go into the domes to see so many flowers etc you need a whole day to do it all
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Love the 2 domes, very beautiful and educative at the same time. The flower dome's theme is always changing. The super trees light show is always nice to watch too. This time they have new installations of light up eggs on the river too."
Gardens by the Bay,5,An amazing day out. Lived the Cloud Forest but the Floral Fantasy's flight of the Dragonfly was fun as was the #FutureTogether tea experience with animated tea to drink. Loves the free shows too.  Lots to do and see. Well worth the visit
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing sight. An urban oasis
Gardens by the Bay,5,Good place anytime for having a walk
Gardens by the Bay,5,Enjoy the place in solitude.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place to visit in Singapore. I liked the light show there. it starts 7:45PM daily.

The Gardens by the Bay is spanning 110 hectares (270 acres) within the Marina Bay district of the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir.
The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden.
The largest of the gardens is the Bay South Garden at 54 hectares (130 acres) designed by Grant Associates.
The gardens by the bay has a greenhouse named Flower Dome. It is the largest glass greenhouse in the world."
Gardens by the Bay,5,This place is amazing. I loved the beauty of this place. The gardens were excellent. Lots of variety of flora and fauna. The maintenance is also commendable of this place. It was clean and beautiful attractions of fountains and sky bridge. The light show at gardens was also amazing. With same go one can see water and light show at marina. That place is just nearby only walking distance. The show was beautiful. Must visit place in Singapore. Highly recommended for visit by all ages.
Gardens by the Bay,4,Alternative walking in the neighbourhood park and by the sea. Supertree Grove is a great place to explore nature in a man-made park 👍
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Splendid is the word! For some place to be so beautiful and the fact that it is man-made, is simply wonderful. The Gardens by the Bay has four sections that you got to visit. The Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome, the Trees and the Marina Bay viewings area, In my opinion the cloud forest is the more exciting of the two domes, showing the environment of multiple plants in all heights. You also learn how we treat our planet and how we should improve our behaviour."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A lovely place to visit
Seems more magical after dark.
Can be very busy.
Plenty to see if you are not willing to pay to enter the inner parts.
Well worth the visit.
Best toilets were in the shop. Others had queues.
Easy to find from the metro station."
Gardens by the Bay,5,The cloud dome is super cool and fascinating. I think it's the best rainforest indoor garden I ever been. Lot's of flowers collection amazing designs.
Gardens by the Bay,4,The creativity they thought when making this garden is amazing. I highly recommend the cloud forest and go near the golden hour. The least favorite was the flower fantasy because it was short but has potential. Just be prepared to get your picture taken by other people lol
Gardens by the Bay,5,"They’ve tried their best to decorate for the Tangling Festival light during this Pandemic. At least I still can see something different.

Imported from South Korea ROYAL FAMILY’S WALK (皇室出巡)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Located by the Marina Bay Waterfront in the heart of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay is a sanctuary for nature lovers and budding horticulturalists alike. Comprising three distinct spaces over 101 hectares–Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden–this oasis of lush greenery has won multiple accolades since it first opened in 2012.

The beauty of nature beckons visitors to the Flower Dome in Bay South Gardens. Covering 1.28 hectares, this verdant space is the larger of three cooled conservatories, and broke the Guinness World Record as the World’s Largest Glass Greenhouse in 2015. It is home to plants and flowers from five continents, from thousand-year old olive trees to magnolias and orchids. While certainly one of Gardens by the Bay’s most spectacular attractions, the Flower Dome is far from the only floral paradise that awaits visitors.

Gardens by the Bay’s third conservatory—the aptly named Cloud Forest—is a mist-filled landscape of rare vegetation and dramatic vistas. Towering above the conservatories’ ferns and pitcher plants is Cloud Mountain, a 35-metre tall structure veiled in mist and covered in lush vegetation. Your imagination is bound to soar as you scale its heights, and discover plant life from the tropical highlands.

As you exit the conservatory, you’re likely to notice a grove of soaring, surreal structures, known as the Supertrees. These vertical gardens span 25 to 50 metres in height, with two of the towering structures connected by the dramatic arch of the OCBC Skyway. When dusk falls, the grove lights up with the Garden Rhapsody, a spectacle of light and sound. For an unforgettable view of Singapore, ascend to the top of the Supertree Observatory, a 50-metre-high observation deck, which boasts an unobstructed vista of the beautiful Marina Bay district.

Round off your visit to Gardens by the Bay with an unforgettable sunset at Bay East Garden. The lush open lawns and beautiful waterfront will give you an unobscured view of Singapore’s skyline."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Quite the unique experience. I last came during the New Year’s festivities and it was truly amazing. Never seen anything quite like it. If you want to have the experience of a lifetime, try to visit during a holiday event (if you can book it)."
Gardens by the Bay,5,So calming and green. The light show after evening is a must see. Come early if you want to sit. Also at night the lighting of this place is mesmerizing
Gardens by the Bay,4,Beautiful Flowers & Plants
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must visit location when in Singapore. This was my second trip to the Gardens by the Bay. It is it usual amazing. The orchid displays made the visit even better.

The visit was capped off by the amazing evening light show. We were able to view the first show on the ground and saw the second show from the Sky Walk. I have always missed the show when in Singapore. It was outstanding."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful sight for eyes. Flower and nature lovers will surely enjoy their entire day admiring the beauty of it like i did... photographers will find this Pandora box very astonishing...
find a million hidden spots for the perfect social media picture."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Peaceful greenery,relax place"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"A very nice experience, really well maintained and you can see they take care of it. Love that the 2 domes, which you have to pay for, are air conditioned. I asked for a return stamp, the guy seemed confused but did it. While I was waiting for the light show about 1 hour wait when I was done, I came back and chilled in the AC. The walk way also a paid attraction was short but had some excellent views."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Incredible place especially at night time and if you are lucky enough to catch a special occasion like the lantern light show. One of my favorites is the Chinese garden at late night for its serene scenery and look over the garden on the back side. Well, of course the sky trees are just out of this world, more like a freaky scene cut out of James Cameron's Avatar movie..."
Gardens by the Bay,5,This is definitely for me one of places I was happy I visited. Climbing the sky bridge was definitely an experience I wouldn’t forget in a hurry. Highly recommend.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Definitely a must visit place in Singapore. It's difficult to see the flora at night so would recommend coming during the day, but there's also sights that can only be seen at night.

Around Christmas there's beautiful lights and festivities."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place to go jogging in the morning. It is huge and I wasn't able to see the whole garden. Should definitely visit the 2 domes - Flower Dome - the largest greenhouse in the World, and Cloud Forest. The cool air was a relief from the extremely hot weather outside, when I visited. The giant trees light up at night and the place becomes magical."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"After visiting this place, I became proud that the finest people did it.  I and all visitors are delighted! Continue dear Singaporeans to amaze people with their beauty!  YOUR BEAUTY GETS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND MAGIC!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great collection of flowers and other plants.  Very well organized display of the flowers. The cloud dome has a large man made waterfall. A mandatory place to visit in Singapore for tourists. The large supertrees are eye catching and highlight of the place. The lights and sound show is amazing to watch.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Stunning, gorgeous, amazing. Don't miss it if you are in Singapore. You can easily spend hours wandering around here."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"always impressive looking up at the giant trees... Unfortunately, the night lights performance is temporarily halted due to covid measures.

not a big flower person myself, but the occasional visit is very pleasant."
Gardens by the Bay,3,"Great place to visit
But
Due to covid, it getting less visitor compare to previous
While the environment, i can see quite dirty... Hope it will look clean for next visit"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Love how well taken care are the plants. Known for the Supertrees and now the tallest Supertree is the Observatory at the rooftop. It is the only tourist attraction in Singapore that I frequent as a local. Love the beauty and heart placed into its cafe. ❤️
Gardens by the Bay,5,What an incredible and special place! Beautiful and day and night. We visited the gardens right around sunset when it wasn’t too hot and got to enjoy the views of both daylight and nighttime. We also got to see the gardens music / lights show which was incredible. Must see when you’re in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It's still a great place to visit even after having done so many times with family, friends, colleagues and now with kids. Currently decked out in Christmas ornaments. Lovely!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"The best place to hang out with your family and loved ones. There are so many beautiful object you can find here if you are into photography.

The place is beautiful. Avoid weekends if you want to enjoy the place without so many crowds.

You can choose many gardens you want to visit and skip the one you don’t like."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great walk on a lovely sunny day when we were there. Didn't go to any of the paid entries. But even the free walk around was lovely, bring a bottle of water and a hat. Has a lot of different types of plant species. Just to cool off, there is always a McDonald's soft serve.."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Nothing beats being surrounded by the natural fauna and flora species from various parts of the world. Well maintained cloud and flower domes with seasonal plant changes, well ventilated and pleasant attraction for both locals and tourists of all ages. Do catch the special 50% off promotion for SG residents during March school holidays"
Gardens by the Bay,4,Love this place with whatever plants display they have. Beautiful Christmas setup this time. Lovely poinsettias!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazingly beautiful and interesting! The place was magnificent, facilitated with many toilets and water fountains, there were souvenir shop inside as well. Ticket rate was reasonable."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Definitely special experience, nice variety of plants from all around the world. Walking the garden is free, accesing the 2 special round closed buildings (flowers an cloud forest) will cost around 25s$ per person. The sky walk around the big famous trees is 8s$.
In the evening (8pm and 9pm) you have a light show where the trees light up with colorful lights on music tune."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing to see the super trees lighted up at night!
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best places to unwind with group of friends or family

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful Scenery and city skyline for a peace of mind, Immaterial of your activities."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the top Icons of Singapore. You can find most colourful night in no where of the world but here. Free for public.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I miss the beauty of Gardens by the Bay with a crowd. Soon it will happen, for now if you have time you can still enjoy this view with less people around."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Where can you find an air conditioned flower dome and cloud forest except at Gardens by the Bay! Truly love the spectacular architecture and efforts in curating the floral display that changes with seasons.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Truly beautiful place. We visited at night and enjoyed a wonderful light show. The pond with the light up eggs and the baby are both magnificent works of art. Not worth the money to pay for the skywalk. Enjoy the beautiful view from the ground!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which are located in separate domes. You must at least spend a whole day at these two attractions, with most time consuming being in the Cloud Forest. The first thing you would appreciate is the cool and comfortable air conditioning of the dome. The domes have to be at a certain temperature to keep the domes habitable. For the Flower Dome, you will love the smell of all the flowers and plants. They actually have flora from across 3 continents living in the dome. There is also free guided tours available at set times. I joined one about the history of orchids and it was great. Takes about 10-15 minutes. For the Cloud Forest, the indoor water wall is breathtaking. You actually go up the water fall structure. It has around 5-6 levels and each level has something different. Due to an appointment, we did not have time to finish the Cloud Forest and had to do an express walk down. That is why I said that you must spend at least a day in the gardens and take your time to appreciate everything. 100% will revisit the gardens. I recommend going on a weekday as there are a lot of tourist everywhere. Best avoid and not add to the crowds for your best experience."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"There is awesome place for day and night which you can spend time with friend, family, or date. There is 2 domes for you to explore 😊 which you can get the tickets online or direct from counter. Even, you do not to do both, you still can enjoy the things outside. at 8.45 pm., there is light shows with soft music that is beautiful and romantic. So, dont forget camera and someone beside you😁"
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice cool (literally) place with not much crowd. The Cloud Forest is amazing!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Excellent place to visit at least once. It's a little tiering to do all in one day specially if it's very hot.

But worth the experience since it's one of a kind. It's man made garden creation experience that it's hard to see somewhere else.

I may not come back for this but at least once worth visiting.

I add pictures an movies so if you don't have the chance to come at least see what i have seen."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This place is absolutely amazing. Be sure to check the light show at 8pm. Check out their domes as well, cloud forest is a personal favorite. Loved the indoor waterfall! You can bring your bikes and ride through the place as it's a wide park. If you're tired and hungry you can check the satay at the bay for some beer and local food. You also get a good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel here."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely stunning.  Experienced Christmas Wonderland with a short light show. Good selection of food at Satay by the Bay. Good food. Lots of walking, but definitely rewarding!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This very place is the reason to love Singapore! The park is very well maintained. The iconic flowers are even more stunning in the evening, when a light/music show is held.

The park is completely free to walk around in. I would recommend to walk around in the Japanese gardens."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice walk in the night and some satays at Satay Club
Gardens by the Bay,5,Absolutely nice view!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Awesome..eye catching
Gardens by the Bay,5,"tickets are easy to purchase online, gardens are so huge, clean, and really gorgeous. crowds at entrance is menacing but because of how spacious the layout of the gardens are, it does not feel claustrophobic inside. very happy to have this place to frequent."
Gardens by the Bay,4,The Garden offers lots of attractions for visitors both indoor and out door. Nature lovers can appreciate beautiful flowering plants in air-condition comfort at the Flower Domes
Gardens by the Bay,3,Not much to admire during the day. It's best visited at night. Most of the garden is free but the cloud forest is paid and so is the sky walk. There is a kid's garden inside with water fountains under which kids can play.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Very nice and huge gardens and/or parks with a lot of attractions and a great light show in the evening. I personally don't think the two domes, the Cloud Forest and especially the Flower Dome, are worth the visit but the rest of the place is really beautiful, green and relaxing. I would give it 5 stars but, unfortunately, they made the whole park ""smoke free"" without any smoking area. That's a complete nonsense and people have to walk long way out of the park to have a smoke. And the area just in front of the park is full of butts and other trash. Great solution Singapore! ;)"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Beautiful place, friendly people"
Gardens by the Bay,5,All of the elements of the gardens are beautiful and well joined together. We had dim sum in the restaurant between the cloud and flower domes. Very nice food.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing gardens with variety of interesting things going on from sculptures and art, kids play areas and amazing structures and the two domes. Spent 2 hours wandering the gardens before going into the domes which were different and relief from the heat with the air conditioning"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Coming to Gardens  by the Bay give good memories ... outing with elderly ..
Good choice of outdoor and indoor walk.  Well covered walk way. And wheelchair friend."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I'm a frequent visitor. Visited Flower Dome(orchid and osmanthus special exhibit), and Dragonfly Lake today. Due to Covid-19 measures, ScanEntry must be done. Also, conservatories visit must be booked prior and have time allocation. Nevertheless, today's visit was seamless and hassle free. Excellent planning on their side.

I am always awed by their level of cleanliness at their gardens!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gardens by the Bay is really an amazing and important place to visit. The Amount of Work put into making it and maintaining it is Impressive. There are many attractions and usually take 1-2 days to visit them all. One of my favourite Attractions was Cloud Forest(S$14). You can see all the attractions throughout the day and enjoy the trees at night. in evening (7:45pm/8:45pm) they even play Song and Light show on trees which is mesmerizing to see. you can also see Marina Bay Sands Lit up at night from Gardens by the Bay. Overall a must-to-visit place.
Gardens by the Bay,2,"Very nice light show at night, go for the 845 when it is darker, the eggs around the water is also nice. Do not go to the roof of the garden, it is over priced by the view that you see. Not worth it. And they do not let you watch the show up there anyways, and did not tell us about even after I asked. Personally I did not like the music during the show, but that is subjective since I do not enjoy classical music."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Singapore gardens by the bay..  Just fantastic. Gardens like no other. A must see when in Singapore. Something for everyone. Definitely a bucket list addition.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I knew it was going to be cool , but I was still amazed. We visited at night and watched few of the shows and then just walked among the super trees and rest of the garden, including the eggs in the river, floating baby, aquariums in the wall,... It really is a place not to miss when in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"If you love greenery, you should not miss it even though it's artificial."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing experience come here with an umbrella and plenty of time(atleast 3hrs). There will be a lot of walking so please wear comfortable shoes. The flower dome and cloud dome are amazing.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Major tourist attraction , also attracts a lot of local residents as well.."
Gardens by the Bay,5,A technical “garden” with plenary of trees and flowers from around the world. Bonus a cascade. Perfect to visit during a humid day because the environment inside as you understand is controlled.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I want to come to this place so long. And the Falls is the thing I love most. Crowded people is inevitable, so have to take any precious second to pose a beautiful shot. Great place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best experience I had and ever seen in my life. Rich with harmony and beautiful flowers in a dome. Lights display and pleasant music to the ears. Blessed to have the opportunity to see a wonder.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great concept by the Singapore government. Garden by the bay is one of the major attraction points in Singapore. Apart from flower dome and cloud forest they have laser show twice in night 7:45 and 8:45pm which just spectacular. It's called Opera laser show.

In cloud forest don't miss the mist which is every even hour also there is reentry stamp option available when you are about to leave flower dome and cloud forest by which you can reenter if you want to. They also have a small theatre show while you come down from the top of cloud forest which shows how human activities are affecting eco system and how we can make things better, do watch it."
Gardens by the Bay,5,The most majestic place I have ever been to in my life. I was pinching myself the entire time I was there. Gardens by the Bay should be on everyone's top 10 list of places to visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the bay is one of the greatest tourist attractions in singapore. It’s an enormous nature park with variety’s of flora from all parts of the world. The park looks like an contemporary green house, the flora collections are grown in these green house at controlled environment and temperatures. The park also has some art works displayed."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Man made park and gardens. Lovely to walk around in during the day. Best for me was at night and the light shows at 745pm and 845pm. Absolutely stunning light show.
Gardens by the Bay,5,It is super hot at the noon time and no good restaurants inside the gardens. Best time to visit would be early morning or late afternoon if you wanna see it in the daylight. It is also good at night.
Gardens by the Bay,5,A great place to visit during the day with a great light show on an evening too. Easy to get to as well by using the underground system.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"The gardens & domes are absolutely beautiful! It is a man-made nature park and a landscaping marvel. If you love nature & want to explore Plant life from around the world, this is a must on your trip to Singapore"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gardens by the bay is world famous garden of singapore. you will find almost every flower here and what a design it has! it is fabulous and beautiful. it is near marina bay building.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautifully done. And there was concessions for seniors at half the price, free parking for 4 hours. Nice, delicious food at nearby Satay at the Bay. Enchanting lightning as the night set in."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The gardens are just wow. A lot of plants and trees from different areas. It's a pleasure to walk along the alley and soak in the beauty. When you think that the land is reclaimed from the sea, it's even more incredible. It's free and you should put this on your to do list in Singapore. You should not miss it"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must visit place in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay is a huge, colorful, futuristic park in the bay area of Singapore. Among the standout features are the famous Supertree structures. These offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens, with oversized seashell-shaped greenhouses that recreate chilly mountain climates."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Cool breeze of air inside the dome, majestic plants all over the place, nicely bloom flowers, and a great waterfall inside the building.
Definitely a great place to enjoy fast type of plants.
Highly recommended to go during afternoon, around 5 pm will do.
The transition between day and night was awesome to see, and don't forget to go stroll around the park and see the Rhapsody."
Gardens by the Bay,5,i had a great day...
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is one of the best places we have ever visited. The dragon fly ride was particularly enjoyable. The gardens are absolutely huge, imaginative, beautifully designed, stunning ... An absolutely must visit place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful gardens in the Dome, informative as to why we should all be aware of environmental issues. The light show at the end of the evening is just beautiful! This really is a 'must see' when in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"It was the Christmas Wonderland in 2018 when we visited, while it was all very visually satisfying, the heat and humidity was unbearable. We love very much the flower dome since it was chilled with air-conditioning, and the variety of the flowers was astonishing. Definitely a place to revisit many times over."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lovely place to stroll around the man made ponds decorated with water fountains, sculptures, plants/vegetation, rocks, and benches. At around 7.45 pm, laser show starts on the artificial garden trees. Quite exciting to watch. Sunday night always packed with big crowds. Come early. Worth visiting."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Had few hours in Singapore and selected Gardens by the Bay to wander a bit.
Quite impressive botanic garden with air condition.
If you are a fan of flowers and different plants this is the place for you ( as long you are note suffering from allergies)
Liked the place, a busy during the weekends."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Love this garden. So unique to Singapore. Light show is nice at night but can drag on a little. Not many places to sit. Massive ques for the walking bridge and domes. Trees look superb at night.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful weather ... Blue sky painted with all the beautiful kites
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely memorable experience. Whether you're in Singapore for a day or ten Gardens by the Bay is a must. It's a such a unique experience which I would recommend. And personally I would love to go there again. If memory serves me right there is also a gift shop, now that I would avoid as I saw most of the souvenirs there at the Lucky Plaza for less than half the price. So unless you're desperate, go to the Lucky Plaza and you'll find countless souvenir shops."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It is free to enter to the complex where you see all of the trees, the artwork in the lake and see the amazing views looking back at Marina Bay Sands. The Cloud Forest containing the world’s highest indoor waterfall at 30m tall and the Supertree observatory are amazing and worth the money."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the best place to visit in Singapore 👌 if you love nature garden stuff, you have got to visit this place pronto. So many things to see, so little time. They have 2 big domes to explore. The flower dome and clouds forest. Both are equally interesting to see and the buildings are right beside each other. Have to pay certain fee for both of these places of course. Better buy it in klook, easier. Lots of things to photograph as you can see from my collection. It is a sight to behold. Bring your loved ones here and just enjoy the scenery and what it has to offer. You won't be disappointed 😁👍"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"would recommend to go once life time. Flower dome its pretty at night for lights, flowery colours in the morning."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"So much to do and see here! Wasn’t too expensive. I had no idea what to expect inside. Different corridors of plants are from various regions around the world. Plants from South Africa, China, Venezuela, etc. it was very very unique and a must see! I can’t explain everything here! You just have to go!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Totally worth the visit. Visit during the day and night for the light show. Allow yourself to get lost and enjoy. It was a quick walk from my hotel but there are taxis. And there is food in the area if you get hungry.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Although the place was on Phase 2 it was still a favourite garden not only for the tourists but also for the local who favours the greenery.Everyday you can see stream of guests visiting the garden.Weekends are favourite for the domestic workers.Come & be mesmerised by the Giant dome trees & 2 enclosed dome housing all types of trees scrubs cactus frim around the Globe
Gardens by the Bay,4,Beautiful shows and lovely climate I wish for in Singapore. A tad disappointed with the main circle Scandinavian show this year. All the same decor for trees yet the write-up online looked fantastic and made me excited to visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Truly a must see.  If you enjoy nature, this is a plant lovers dream.  As a flower fanatic who appreciates technology, this place tics all the boxes."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Night strolls are a must here, the lights and scenery really make it for a great and relaxed time. Kids or no , always great for photos. Then you can walk to Marina Bay sand hotel and eat or just shop."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Definitely a must see when visiting Singapore. There are tickets available to loads of experiences. Some of them seem quite overpriced for what they are, but the supertree grove walk is definitely worth the price. Crowds tend to come here at night when the trees light up, but it’s just as stunning in the day time."
Gardens by the Bay,5,How I loved it here. I loved it here so much that I went twice in my short visit. My favorite is the opera light show at dusk. It's a beautiful family friendly outdoor space. I cannot wait to return.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Despite the restrictions, the hotel services were superb. Really enjoyed my stay"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"What originally was going to be an hour or so planned to visit we left 3.5 hours later. This was phenomenal. The gardens were breathtaking. The waterfall was amazing and you could see people having fun getting a little bit damp if they got too close. We saw some amazing artwork and things we didn’t expect to see. There are three main different attractions to purchase tickets to see; the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest and the Floral Fantasy but we ran out of time to see the Floral Fantasy. If you want to see everything there is to see get there early as it will take longer than you expect as there is so much to see, read about and interact with. This is great for all ages and I would highly recommend a visit and it is wheelchair assessable."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Good place to relax and smell the flaura and fauna literally 😊
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely worth visiting if you're in Singapore. It's beautiful in the day and at night. Make sure you capture the light and music show at night, which is best viewed from the walkway or, for free, beneath the trees. If you time in right do the free show on the river by the bay opposite the Merlion at 8pm then walk here for the show at 845pm. The river show is called Spectra and also shouldn't be missed.

If you have the time and money also do the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome during the day."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"If you feeling hot, buy entry into the flower dome and cloud forest to enjoy the cold temperatures there! Otherwise it could take whole day to tour depend on what your interest in! Night shots are beautiful as well!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing experience. Walking through the garden is a great experience and free! They also have a free light show around 19:45 or so which lasted 15 minutes. They played various songs from many different Asian countries and the lights flashed and flowed in sync with the tempo. Was a great experience and didn't pay a single penny.

We bought tickets for the Flower Dome / Cloud Forest at a discounted rate through our hostel (CapsulePod@Aljunied - $22). Tickets for both are usually $28. You need to pay $8pp for the SkyWalk, highly recommend.

Great food place nearby - Hawker Centre called Satay By The Bay. Tons of choices and huge portions. Prices aren't too bad at all and quality is top. Go for the smaller priced/sized portions unless you're a food monster as the portions are large anyway."
Gardens by the Bay,5,It's heavenly. With two domes and solar powered trees. And so many activities to do. The flower dome and cloud forest was so well designed and maintained inside the glass house. A must visit. You will fall in love with this place
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful and expansive, one of the must see gems of Singapore. Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are obviously highlights that everyone makes a bee-line for but if you have time, I recommend take you time strolling through the rest of the gardens, especially around the lake. Very tranquil and scenic....and away from the crowds."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is one of the best place which you can explore without any charges. In evening there is a show around 7 pm at Supertree Grove, which is a must & also free but if you want to have a walk on heights of these groves, then its chargeable..Also if you want to visit Flower Dome & cloud forest dome, you have to buy tickets. Lovely ambience."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens of the Bay, it is very beautiful nature park. It has multiple attractions, Cloud Forest with large waterfall, Flower Dome with varieties of flowers from all over the world. Wear something comfortable, lots of walk to see the attractions. Shuttles are available with extra charges. Go during evening time so that you can see the Light and sound show."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I like to come again and again in Garden by the Bay , because it is beautifully maintained, visually appealing, informative. Cloud garden is an unique concept and so are the more than one dozen Super trees. Sound and lights show in the evening is just amazing."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The best place in Singapore with a huge park inside. Many activities that you can do such as jogging in the evening, enjoying light and water show, visit flower thematic dome that a must-visited-place for you who love to capture variated flowers and so on."

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Welcome to Singapore's gardens by the bay, you can choose to visit the flower or cloud dome in the day. When night falls, you may venture out and check out the magnificent trees.
If you're wondering how Avatar will look like in real life, this could be the closest you can get in reality.
😁"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"If you like to experience what’s like to live in Avatar this is your chance to live in that world. I am a plant and tree lover and this place is paradise to me. There are 4 different gardens and each has it own special theme. You do have to pay for these special garden area but the general area within this complex is free. Not to forget is the free light show that takes place nightly. This week it’s was a Toy Story 4 light show.  Great for the kids.
If you visiting Singapore this is a must see for the family."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Best place ever
Gardens by the Bay,4,"If you appreciate and enjoy seeing flowers, head down to garden by the bay! They have many different kinds and interesting flowers and plants. I don't really like flowers when I am young, but now I find flowers are so pretty! Bring your family along for some family bonding time as well."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Secontime I was here. It’s a beautiful man made signature at Singapore. Time between afternoon and evening is good for viewer. You can explore the beauty of garden in day and night time.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Wonderful park with lush vegetation and amazing attractions. The entrance to the park is free but some of the must-sees require tickets. I recommend going there in the afternoon and wait until sunset to see the beautiful light show!
Gardens by the Bay,2,Nice pleace
Gardens by the Bay,5,Lovely gardens and conservatory. Very clean and a must see when visiting Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Its truly amazing and one of the must visit place in Singapore. How the hell these Forest Dome's were maintained ! Its look very natural and breathtaking. It has an amazing Waterfall inside the Dome. There is Light show at 8 pm free show...Don't miss it !!!

Gardens by the Bay,4,"It's an amazing wonder to see what they have done with this place.  Although it's crowded, it's a nice place to spend the evening and check out. The lighting's are amazing. However have to go a little early to see all the places since some of them close by 8pm but the park is open till midnight."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It's spectacular. U most visit this place. U feel relax in this garden.it's amazing garden in Singapore.Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares (250 acres) of reclaimed land[2]in the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir.

Gardens by the Bay,5,"Its beautiful, never seen anything like this, also highly educative and you can really get a good idea how it works it the forests. Please do visit this place and start making change too, we all can do it!!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I'm you've seen all the reasons you should visit this attraction in Singapore all I'll say is, definitely worth checking it out you most likely won't regret it and you probably haven't seen anything like it. Check out the day time and night time both spectacular! Oh bring water you will need it from walking all over the garden!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to visit in such a busy city! Refreshing to get to walk through such a lovely park and you need to ensure you are on time to see the light show in the evening! A must when visiting Singapore!
Gardens by the Bay,5,I'm so in love with the views.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Love this place. Worth spending many days there. Just to look at the greenery
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Membership is not utilized enough, food is really expensive and it's really hot here. Love the flowers, the exhibition is changed about once a month so we get to see new things every time we are here. Yearly children's festival is free and fun for children. Once in a while they have special exhibition preview for members too."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"best place to go to to see a wide variety of floras and succulents. place is fully air conditioned, thus good to plan this in the afternoon so you can avoid the afternoon heat during your day out.

place has 2 areas, the cloud forest and flower dome. just buy both of them :)

this place host several endangered species and if you in luck, you see them blooming.

also check on their websites as they do have seasonal events. do not miss the sakura event, but expect 100% more crowded the usual crowd."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. The botanical garden is by itself outstanding. But adding the artificial trees as well as the domes, this makes this place a wonderful area to visit. Also, don't forget to come at night for the light show, that we preferred over the Marina Bay Sands light show."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Flower Dome is beautiful with flowers from all around world.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Mid autumn 2020, really beautiful night view"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Second time around  here and it never fails to surprise me. The gardens are superb and the place is so cool, a great relief from the humidity outside. I will go there again and take my time to enjoy the experience."

😉😆😀😁😂"
Gardens by the Bay,3,"It was nice but too touristy. It was the first time I visited 2 dorms, there were too many people so I had to get in a line and wait for too long. Does it worth it? I'm not sure! Inside the dorm, there were many different types of trees and flowers from all over the world. However, to see orchids, I'd prefer go to the Botanic gardens because there were not too many kinds of orchid there, there must be places for other kinds of plan. The waterfall inside the dorm was amazing."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Never bored go to this place.. always amazed with the decoration. This time the theme is tulip! Singapore always put a lot of effort to decorate! Much love!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Breathtaking views of the flowers curated by them!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing landscaping and variety of flora and fuana
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Oh my gosh... What a beautiful place. In deed it is a place to watch. Magnificent construction. Everything was perfectly. Strongly recommended that if someone planning to visit in a holiday, start the journey as morning as possible."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must see in Singapore with an incredible A/C cooling system inside. I recommend the Cloud forest and the Flowers Dome. The first one more appreciated than the second one.
Buy tickets in advance so you can avoid the queue in the sun.
Do not miss the super tree music and light show in the evening."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the amazing icon of Singapore and bare some similarity with the show Avatar. it has brought Singapore on the world map for turning parks not just green but into a creative endeavours where imagination are created and made real. The world is not longer about what is reality but making visions into reality. Real and truth are within the reach of our creativity and science. The best part of the Super Trees here is the one restaurant that host a cocktail on the roof. Previous it cost $18 for a drink and I could spend my time watching the sunset and the breeze gliding passed my face. Paradise! You don't want to miss this one spot in the garden.
Gardens by the Bay,3,"A quick stroll through to get to Satay by the Bay, didnt really get to witness alot as it was getting dark but it was nice to be there for the first time to smell the fresh air (even with my mask on).!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Awesome. Green effort of nature preservation. The domes are astonishing as well as the way every plant and flower are presented and cared. Walking through the skywalk is a must.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"For those who like flora and fauna, it's worth a visit! Then really go length to take care of this place and all those plants inside. Souvenir shop available, cafe and fast food chain too. You can probably be there whole day. I went here on business trip so I'm not so sure about the ticket price but I pretty sure you can check it online."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Its an  architectural masterpiece, very futuristic, showcasing a harmonious blend of nature & man-made structures.

This is such a lovely place. It's so clean and beautiful to walk around. Fantastic collection of flowers and water fountains. They also have light shows in the evening in their super trees. You can easily spend 3-4 hrs here.

A trip to Singapore is incomplete without visiting this man-made wonder.

Highly recommended."
Gardens by the Bay,5,It is located beside marina bay sands hotel. If you like to enjoy the beauty you are recommended to come here at early morning or afternoon. Cloud forest and flower dome are adjacent to the park. The beauty of the nature touched me tremendously. I will love to go there again.
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice place to go.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"For a man made wonder, this is a beautiful place to visit... inspiring to see how well maintained and curated the place is. Must visit if you love nature and the colours!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very calming and soothing place to go if you love plants and flowers. They have different themes every quarterly and I must say they are good!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Really worth the visit. We only paid to go up the bridge, the rest was free and we had a wonderful time walking around the gardens. Beautiful scenery in peaceful settings. The walk bridge had great views of the city below, not so good if you’re scared of heights however. Well worth the visit when in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Is cool place, feeling awesome and so refreshing when entering from outside hot world into amazing cloud forest.."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"If you are looking for a mind-blowing experience gardens by the bay is your place.

The simple thought of this place being Real in our current year doesn't seem possible, but once you are there you can only be amazed

In this place you'll find plants from all over the world with recreated ecosistems."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gorgeous indoor gardens with a very rich history of how it was constructed and how the people of Singapore have created harmony between technology and nature. Quite a sight to see. Definitely suggest going during the periods of watering. The mist gets so thick it's almost like fog. Quite impressive!
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Very clean and beautiful! Remember to bring an umbrella though, in case it rains"
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the fantastic places i have ever visited. Loved it. Totally. Make sure to be there few hours before the closing time. We were late and had to go through the gardens in a hurry. Couldn't take the skywalk unfortunately. Other than that it was an amazing experience.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Garden's by the bay is very special place in Singapore. Because this is made by artificially. So if you see the Garden's by the bay, you can feel surprised development  of technology. These are  very awesome trees and they are connected by shook bridges each other. Therefore you can see the beautiful nature nearby garden's by the bay on the bridge and also you can walk along the bridge. Especially laser show is held at Garden's by the bay at night. So if you go to there on time you can see the fantastic night laser show with music."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This was one of my favourite places in Singapore. A massive garden, well looked after and great information available about the local trees and flowers"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Completely stunning garden where you can find different types of flowers and plants inside.

It is like a giant glass house where you can enjoy natural flower, plants and take some pictures to keep.

It is located right at Marina Bay Sands. Of course it is not free, but I guess the price is ok considering how well they manage the place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Love, love this place. We visited the Gardens during the orchid festival. The display of flowers are colorful and vibrant. They look so healthy.  There were so many people that makes it difficult  t o take pictures. Highly recommended when visiting Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Just wow. Huge gardens with lots to see. Walk around and enjoy the green surrounding you.
Plenty mini attractions inside, such as: light show, botanical stuff, tree top walk and much much more. Definelty a place you must visit when in Singapore!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Now, there are may be only a few people who may not know about the majestic Gardens by the Bay, and that's totally ok. It's one of the most celebrated spots here in Singapore. So every year, during September it lights up on the occasion of Mid-Autumn festival and this year it is no less with breath-taking lanterns adorning the entire place that depict stories of rich tradition and heritage. Don't miss the captivating cultural performances and activities at the festival."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It was fun place espionage for plant lovers. They have exhibited all different kinds of plants from different countries and also shows the Singapore's first MAN MADE WATERFALL(which by the way was fantastic).
A quick FYI; this place is the first man-made area. The whole area belongs to the sea and they bought sand from other countries and had built the island there.
And here's the FUN FACT...Come at evenings for the special Garden bay light show."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"this place is good to visit when it is even day because the lights of the trees are colorful,
there is a musical performance around the tree and the color of the tree lights changes according to the strains
music. this place is clean, comfortable, and crowded. if you want to go up to a tree pay $ 8 but park
under the tree is also nice and clean and also free, many people sit and lie there.
this place is not too far from the merlion about 20 minutes if you walk through the helix bridge
if you are here, you should arrive at 7:00 PM"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to visit especially during the evening. The lights around are worth a watch. The lights and sounds show happen during the evening but you have to be quick to move from one place to another because you do not have much time between the two events and the shows are limited.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"~We decided to go on a Monday in hopes that the place wouldn't be too crowded. It wasn't too crowded and we got to take many nice photos!! Floral Fantasy is a new addition, so we went for it, and it was really lovely- the whole place had a potpourri smell to it and there were many photogenic spots! We went to Floral Fantasy and Flower Dome cause the Cloud Garden is under construction today. I've been to Flower Dome many years ago, and it hasn't changed much since then. Overall, Gardens by the Bay is a nice place to go to if you love nature and taking photos! The place is very asthetically pleasing to the eyes :) The price for floral fantasy is 20sing, and flower dome is also 20sing (if you're a foreigner), but they have a ticket where you pay 36sing for both and it includes the shuttle bus :)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful garden with two aircon indoor areas to escape the Singapore heat. Has different seasonal flower display in the flower dome that charges every couple of months. Next time to visit is in the late afternoon so there is still sunlight to see all the beautiful flowers,  while also being able to see the lights up of the giant tower outside the flower dome as after the sunset."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I recommend the flower dome and cloud forest bundle deal.

Beautiful lush greenery with flowers and plants from all over the world.

Cloud forest is jaw droppingly amazing especially at night.

As it is a very well known tourist attraction it does get very busy"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Still one of the best of Singapore. Cleaner and better.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the best gardens in the world. Best part is it's free for public even for the light show at evening.

Highly punctual and get neatly maintained. A must visit place for all tourist visiting Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Loved it ! Free wifi available and we saw a monitor lizard in the ponds. Definitely worth a visit
Gardens by the Bay,5,Going back for more
Gardens by the Bay,5,this place improved since the last time i was here. still a beauty to behold.
Gardens by the Bay,5,A must go if you are in Singapore! Air conditioned comfort! Amazing experience! Got to buy tickets to the flower dome and the cloud forrest. Highly recommended 👍
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing place. A must see if in Singapore. Beautiful gardens.   Like walking in the movie Avatar.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Breath taking, amazing experience. You are immediately taken to the amazon rain forest as soon as you walk in.  A must in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,4,The two domes are worth seeing. One is rain forest where in lot of forest species are grown with lot of care. The other has flower species from different parts of the globe Nice location to take photographs for newly wed as well as family
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must visit place in SG. It makes the visit very worthy and enjoyable. Although it was hot outside, the garden is always cool inside and the scenic is just like a miracle."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is a big call but I’m prepared to say Gardens by the Bay is the only reason you need to visit to Singapore.  Anything else is a bonus.  It is that good - an utterly astonishing achievement.  A  wonderland of delight.  An incredible feast for the senses in every way.

These gardens are nothing short of amazing.  We spent several hours here today just gasping at the size and scale of the place and the beauty everywhere.  I have never taken so many photos.  Every part of these gardens is utterly magnificent.  I would not know where to begin describing them as there is so much to see.  They are superbly and thrillingly designed.  They are beautifully and meticulously maintained.  It is a truly wondrous place.  We spent four hours here.  I’d really like to spend many many times more.  Entrance to everything is not cheap.  But gosh, is it worth it.  It is worth every cent and more.  It is an essential thing for everyone.

We went to an alleged botanic gardens in the great city of Rome last week.  It was a once great space that is now sad and neglected.  A shadow of a decent gardens due to inadequate resources and presumably lack of interest.  The Singaporeans are doing the exact opposite.  Their achievement with Gardens by the Bay says so much about their intelligence, energy, confidence and competence.

Do not miss this place."
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of my favorite places in Singapore. The exhibits in the flower dome and cloud forest are always refreshed and we'll maintained. The kids playground is a nice free water park which our kids love to go to. Good priced and delicious hawker food in satay by the bay. Definitely a regular place we frequent in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice place to go. Leisure. Exercise. Other attractions.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"It was a superb, awesome experience. Lovedtje atmosphere. Visit at night if you want to see the beauty of lights too. A must visit place in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Who don't know the famous gardens by the bay?
Well, I tell u, this is one of my favourite place in Singapore, u know why, because there's a lot of beautiful flowers u can see, very pretty, can't get enough of them 😍😍 I forget how much the price we have to pay the entrance ticket, maybe about $28 but I guarantee it's worth buy ☺️☺️ eyes pleasure 😍😍😍😍"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely worth the visit. Aim to be around 18hs to see them with daylight and wait until the light show. If you can spare the time and money visit the domes, but I have to say: they are not my favorite part (supertrees are)"
Gardens by the Bay,5,We'll worth a visit. You only need Half day if that. Take the metro or a city tour. If your here for a few days it's easy to do your own thing👍
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Probably one of the most recognizable sights of Singapore, definitely worth a visit. Super trees look spectacular and there are short light shows with music at around 19:40 after the sunset. It costs around 33 sgd to get up on the trees and the ticket also provides access to the flower dome which I unfortunately didn't have an opportunity to visit, because came too late. If you walk to the Eastern part of the gardens to an observation deck near the seaside you could see a spectacular view of the city, really recommend coming there after the sunset to see it"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Rather crowded, overall a pleasant experience to walk"
Gardens by the Bay,4,"This is a really awesome place to be.

If you are a tourist in Singapore, you will need to visit the Gardens by bay twice else you would have to rush your visit and would not enjoy the scenes.

There is also a mobile app you can download to help map out areas to see depending on the time you have. It is available in the various mobile application stores"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The most pretty park I’ve ever been. I’m not exaggerating, this feels like the avatar movie! Exotic plants everywhere, the most amazing one is that all were blooming! You can know just by the pictures, I will suggest to go for the two domes and don’t go up, unless you have a Pugh budget to go for all of it. They have light show at night before they close so stay a little bit longer to look at them there are 2 shows so if you go up stay there for the first and for the second you can check it from downstairs which is pretty cool as well!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"There is plenty to do at Gardens by the Bay, you can easily spend a full day here. It is full of nature and beauty. The supergrove trees were something to behold, we really enjoyed the light show in the evening; lying on the floor looking up at the display."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"THE garden of the city, the pride of Singapore.

I don’t come here too often, but every time I do, it’s for an occasion. It was the sundown marathon last year and the REAL run this year.

Was pleasantly surprised to catch small glimpses of rainbow 🌈 reflecting from the small fountains after the run.

Awesome development, perfect use of space 👍🏻"
Gardens by the Bay,5,A must see if in Singapore with beautiful grounds to explore and of course the iconic giant trees that can be seen across the skyline of Singapore won't disappoint when up close and have a great light show each night as well.
Gardens by the Bay,4,We wandered Gardens by the Bay and did visit one of the domes. We had visited both a few years ago. There are quite a few paid options available in the gardens so it probably pays to work out beforehand exactly what you want to see. Google is very helpful on this regard.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Man oh man, this place is an exquisite place to enjoy man-made beauty. This place had an incredible array of beautiful things perfectly manicured with an exceptional eye for small details. It truly takes a very large team of dedicated individuals to keep a place so pristine and clean. We enjoyed every moment here. We enjoyed the Cloud Forest more than Flower Dome because there just seemed to be so much more variety. Have at least a few hours to spend here."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Well worth a visit when in Singapore. Well presented parklands with a nice layout well serviced by walkways and shuttles.
Highlights are the dome which do incur an entry fee but are worth the cost and they are air conditioned! A welcome respite in wet season."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Morning Walk. Evening Walk. Just relax and take your own sweet time.
Gardens by the Bay,5,My favourite place to go n have music calming background effect when you are inside the Flower Dome.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Mid autumn festival on going now! My fave place in singapore
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Children’s water play is fantastic, feel safe and clean! Best facilities and staff!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful. Had an enjoyable time here
Gardens by the Bay,5,Well I would have missed going there since I'm not into much touristic stuff but glad that I made it there. It's incredible. One should go n check out the work they have done. More beautiful then these pictures. Do visit once.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Another iconic and incredible place to visit on Singapore! - beautiful gardens, attractions and places to see. A must place visit in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must place to visit in Singapore.

- It has a beautiful flowers and plants from around the world.
- It is a great place for the family. The cloud and flower domes are has air conditioning.
- An excellent place for amateur and professional photographers."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Garden By The Bay felt like a glimpse of
“Eden and Eve Garden”
The whole place are incredible!
It’s a heaven for plant lovers and I am one of them. There are thousands different species of plants and flowers to watch and study.
Probably the best botanic garden that I have ever been. It’s breathtaking experienced.
Highly recommended to visit."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Live in Singapore and this garden just amazed me every time. Here for the light shows called #futuretogether by team lab. It was awesome. Definitely recommended to come here as the garden has multiple event year long, definitely an attraction not just for the tourist but local as well. Also a good place for photograph."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing Views. Really enjoyed the moment of kite flying. Great enjoyment specially for youngsters and kids. Best picnic spot. Amazing atmosphere, as cool oceanic air keep your mind and body in happy mood. Just buy a kite for enjoying the atmosphere. People go for picnics, group outing, dating etc. Guys must go and chill-outb there."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Surely one of the most beautiful gardens in the region. This place offers not just flora but also the usage of modern technology to bring out the best of nature. Infusing technology with nature is one way to bring in the crowd especially as people expect more from attractions.

The place is crowded and sometimes it can get really packed especially during weekends and public holidays. If is advisable to avoid the afternoon period as it can get extremely hot. Try early (very) mornings or late in the evenings."
Gardens by the Bay,5,The garden is very beautiful.it is like a haven.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Super Trees at the Gardens by the Bay, is the perfect example of Singapore's greatest strength... a city provides a true balance between bustling modern city and the organically green and enchanting landscape we all wish to live in.The Skywalk around the Super Trees was breathtaking and the light show was really engaging. The botanical displays of the Flower Dome are wonderful as are the sculptures throughout, but the true whimsy of the place is revealed in the Cloud Forest, which leads you through a mountain of flora so varied yet well integrated that the experience transports you to another world. The Gardens by the Bay are an absolute must for any first-time traveller to Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing night views, very cool temperature, walk around the garden with trees, lights and lake. Really enjoy this place! Must to visit in Singapore!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,A must see in Singapore. Visited the cloud forest and the flower dome. It's spectacular! It's not just for sight seeing but it makes you appreciate nature and makes you think what can you do to preserve them.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Visited in early September to have a look at the exhibition on sunflowers. Very nice setup with lots of different varieties of sunflowers; I never knew there were so many! Probably best to go sometime before noon before the place starts to get crowded. Also a good place to hide out from the heat if you've been walking around the Gardens for a bit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Just see the night light show was amazing but you need all day just to enjoy the work and arts and carvings and displays to get the most out of this amazing adventure of plants and environmental displaces. Can't wait to go back.
Very happy with this tour but more time was needed"
Gardens by the Bay,5,It was not far away from town and it was a great experience for children. My son really loved the cloud forest and he could not control himself with excitement. Try it when you are in Singapore! Staff were friendly with smile. There were lots of different kinds of flowers in the cloud forest building. I could not describe all of them.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing garden. Beatiful views, very nice staff. Definitively a must if you are in Singapore! I would've paid more then the actual price."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Pleasant place to visit for people who loves flowers and plants. Nice ambience. Currently it displays a Christmas theme with a wide variety of poinsettias from the Scandinavian countries.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"That's the most beautiful and impressive place in Singapore in my opinion. This park is really stunning and full of picturesque areas spread on a vast green area with lake, two big greenhouses with artificial water fall and a collection of exotic plants.
But actually the most famous area maybe are those famous high metallic palms with are structures where plants grown up around. There are some high pedestrian bridges witch connect some of then and also there's a restaurant with a complete stunning view to the park and to Marina Bay Sands Hotel across the garden.
It's not cheap if you want to visit all those attraction and for security those pedestrian bridge close to visitation when the weather is windy. I really recommend!!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,The cloud forest and flower dome was very pretty and amazing. And don't forget to see the light show. It was very beautiful.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful place and haven for nature lover like me. You should visit both the cloud forest and flower dome. The place is cool that you will feel you are surrounded by plants. The waterfall in cloud forest is so real and the splash of water is amazing!  Aside from the varieties of plants and flowers the architecture is also commendable! The flower dome is a feast for the eyes as it display various kinds of flowers. It so beautiful and colorful. Great place to visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Enjoyed the tranquility of walking in the cool climate of the Cloud Forest dome at sunset. Great that there are many options for food nearby, and seasonal events to liven things up!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful place to bring family to.
Gardens by the Bay,4,The poinsettia Christmas display in Flower Dome was really pretty. Second time at this display and they have done a better job in ensuring a better walking flow through the exhibit by barricading some areas.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Really nice during the day but Incredible at night, they have two shows of music and lights that are amazing. Check out the schedule because sometimes they change a little bit.
During the day the attraction are really expensive I think, but you can walk for free."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Gardens by the bay is relaxing.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Pretty cool site in Singapore. Definitely a tourist attraction, but worth checking out, whether from a distance or closer up. We did the sky tree walk between two of the supertrees and I really enjoyed it, but I wouldn’t say you’d be missing out by skipping it. I would’ve loved to see them closer up at night too, but we weren’t in the area for it unfortunately."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"My wife and I had a long layover in Singapore, we decided to visit the Gardens by the bay. As you walk into the garden you are welcomed by the beautiful waterfall that is the first photo opportunity of this beautiful location. The garden is very well thought out, easy to walk through and is setup to make sure you don’t miss any of the displays. We were lucky enough to go on a decent temperature day, so it was perfect to walk around and enjoy the exhibit. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A Relaxing semi-natural hand-man made forestry. A lot of flowers, plant species and natural landscape. Moreover, the Mosaic of Human Diversity is well present in the Park. Easy to reach by Metro. Good for walking and rest between walks. Well preserved, clean and a lot of free spaces. Good for kids. They can release the Natural Energy. A lot of Green landscape.🙏🙏🙏."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Just a very nice place to visit. Enjoy nature at its finest
Gardens by the Bay,4,Interesting gardens. Definitely worth an explore. Went to the light show which was okay (expensive for what it was) and not as good as the free laser show by the sands. Some lovely spaces through the gardens -- and especially loved the eggs that changed colours in the river in the evening.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Absolutely impressive and a must-see in Singapore. The light show starts at 7.45pm and takes about 10 minutes, it's best to watch it below the flower towers. The gardens are huge, you can find signage and toilets as well as some restaurants and cafes at the entry, near the flower towers and at the bay. The views from Dragonfly Bridge are amazing of both the Marina Sands Hotel and the towers. In the evening, it gets quite crowded because of the light shows. Best to come around 6/7 pm, so you can see the gardens both in daylight and at night."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Absolutely spectacular.  Don't miss this area. Good food. But the light show at the Giant trees and the pond was worth it. I could go every day.
Gardens by the Bay,4,Fantastic place which definitely worth a visit both during the day or at night! Very well maintained of the garden and the pictures snapped over here are Gorgeous!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Great place to have a walk around and get out of the concrete jungle. I particularly enjoyed the Chinese garden area for its tranquility.
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of my favorite places to chill out in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Those astonishing Supertrees Garden located by the Marina Bay Waterfront in the heart of Singapore, would surely give you some surreal sights, indeed a sanctuary for nature lovers. Visit Gardens by the Bay at night and be dazzled by its glimmering lights and daily lights and sound shows."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay has been voted as The Top 10 Garden in the World. Built at a cost of almost S$1Billion Dollars specially designed to house florals and trees from all over the world. The outdoor landscape changes through the seasons, lots of activities and events for frequent visitors. Within the climatic dome you will find plants, flowers and trees from Tropics to Equatorial region. All views from every angle makes a memorable photo for your album. Yes, do bring your camera or Video Cam to share with friends and family this rare experience. You have to experience it and soak in the warmth here to appreciate nature. Yes, they have a nursery on site to keep the plants happy. In the evening, you can enjoy a totally different ambience with special lighting display, you will enjoy a very different view from the day. The choice is yours to enjoy."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"An outdoor and indoor garden where one can feel being in a lush forest of flora and fauna.
The flower dome showcases different flowers and plantsbfrom around the world. Featured flowers change from season to season.
Enjoy the cloud forest's indoor waterfalls and lush vegetation which includes rare orchids and carnivorous plants. Or walk above the the trees and water falls mist on the sky walk.
A canopy walk can be found on the other side of the park.
A must see when in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is the best that one can get when a Singapore. Nature and human architecture at their best, mixed into a surrealistic garden, built of metal and wood, but also of real trees, shrubs and grass. Best experienced if visited during the day, to see it alive, and during the night, at the sound and light show. Too hot during noon, at least in March when we visited, but every second spent in garden worth it. did not take the tree walk, but will do if I have a second change to visit Singapore !"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful place, just woaw.... And the trees are made on purpose to give proper needs to the indoor garden with all types of trees which exist in the entire world.

Huge place, lots of facilities a food court is available,people do their jogging, walking. A kids amusement like a water park is available as well.

The bridge which lead to the Marina Sands Resort gives a fantastic view and best time to visit is during the evening."
Gardens by the Bay,5,The most futuristic gardens that I have ever seen. The best part is that my kids loved this place. They were so tired but they strolled around the whole facility. Its beautifully designed and well maintained.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"If you are garden people from Australia, you won't feel that impressed. The artificial tree light show is a different experience. However, too many tourists and you have to line up for an extremely long time to wait for a taxi, which would end the tour not very pleasant. The exit traffic was very congested."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Magical place. One of the coolest man-made attractions I've ever been to
Gardens by the Bay,4,"This place is one of the few man made miracles of our time. I loved it and I loved everything about it. It might be improved if there were some activities or food trucks just to keep that consumerism happening, ya know. Or at least an ice cream truck or a crepe truck would be appreciated"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A well manicured garden/park. There's lots to look at and a perfect place for a stroll. The supertree Grove, flower dome, cloud garden are some of the key places to visit. It is a must visit."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"A huge open garden. Many spots to visit. Can't be covered in one day.
Few attraction is paid upon entry. Check at ticketing counter for more info.
Available parking space that is close to entrance."
Gardens by the Bay,3,"It's a great place forpeople that wanna visit an attraction in Singapore considering how large it is but it's also relatively pricey depending on how much you're willing to shill for some of its more special attractions like the Cloud Forest with one ticket costing about 28 SGD per person.

If you can't fork out the money for those and you're not a permanent resident at Singapore it's worth the one time visit but not particularly worth multiple trips otherwise.

It's more of a 3 and a half star and less a flat 3 star."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"One of the most beautiful places in Singapore. Must visit to see the trees, cloud forest, flower dome, cactus garden and so much more. There's a restaurant called ' Satay by the Bay'; at the end of Gardens by the Bay and they serves some of the best chicken satay you can have in Singapore. You can easily spend 2-3 days  exploring this place depending on how much you can walk and pack up in a day."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Awesome and very cool place to hangout with family or hangout solo.
Its very huge.
It good to visit in day and evening too.
U can enjoy whole day there.
It has a very famous light show and water show in the evening.
I loved this place"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Fantastic, lovely place to go with the whole family! Enjoy two sections filled with exotic plants from all over the world.  Plus the park spans a massive distance with restaurants and sights to see."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Man, what a great way to spend a Saturday morning. Super trees are astounding. The walk is easy and beautiful. The views are stunning, particularly of Marina Bay Sands. Well worth a 2 hour pit stop, or add another 4 hours to do the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome."
Gardens by the Bay,5,A truly wonderful place.  I recommend visiting both day and evening.  A place where time stops.
Gardens by the Bay,5,So beautiful and you'll be amaze by it how  the plants are still hanging in there. We called  that  Beauty At Its Best
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I always love walking about the Super tree Grove at night. Mesmerising lights bathe the giant trees in an azure hue, and as you walk amongst the trees you can catch glimpses of Marina Bay Sands or the Singapore Flyer."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Nice place to chill out
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Mind blowing environment. Nd the way they have maintained it, is amazing. So much more than just flowers that you think you coming to see. Amazing musical lights that danced with every song this played to accompany the good music. So many amazing sculptures and sights to see and one place, along with the Majestic flowers and plant life.

Superb place to have the enjoyment with kids also.Such an amazing pictures taken here. It was a heaven on earth experience. Just a short walk from the metro station so very convenient. Surely   a 5-star rating for everything is a well-deserved accolade. . Great place, lovely attractions!!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is a must see if you're in Singapore. If you enjoy nature and amazing engineering then look no further because this area of town has it all. 250 acres to be exact. I highly suggest you go later the day before sunset and visit all the gardens. Then stay and watch the lights take the night. There's is hours of sight seeing to be had. From the cloud gardens, to the super trees this place is out of this world. I kept thinking Avatar while I was there. I personally think it gets pretty busy until late into the night but it's open till 2am and that's when you're able to walk around and see everything without all the people. At around 9pm things close down and they do a light show at the Trees which is something to check out. But take the time to wonder because it's so worth it. Take a look at my pictures and see for yourself. Please like them. It's about 40 dollars to check out the cloud gardens and flower fantasy which if you're really into that then it's worth it. But if not it's mainly tons of kids and tourists which are a lot to deal with."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Can't give any disruptive comments because what am seeing on my screen is very awesome indeed love to stay there
Gardens by the Bay,5,Well worth it. I got the everything ticket. The way to go. Have so enjoyed coming here.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing place to visit for viewing the world's largest green house containing 60,000 plus varieties of trees and plants. Built with outstanding asthetics of steel and glass this structure is a feast for the eyes.
The adjacent structure of cloud dome is another marvel where artificial water fall has been created with great precision to recreate the feel of a real waterfall. Both the buildings are brainchild of Singapore's founder. The entire complex highlights the efforts of the Singaporean government to conserve nature."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"An 8th wonder of the world, the man who envisioned it, forgive me for not remembering his name, is a true genius. The flora seen throughout the entire garden is exquisite, to say the least. The two domes are marvelous, the super tree groves are fabulous and the light and sound show is amazing. I can't describe it in words but all I can say is, this place needs to be visited, you cannot miss it if you come to Singapore. So please, do yourself a favour and visit it."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Good place to spend the evening. Light show at night is amazing. Marina Bay Sands is an enthralling architecture which is situated very close. Cloud forest is one of a kind not to be missed. Sunset from top of Marina Bay Sands should be on top of the list
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Wonderful Place and a must visit if you're in  Singapore!
Ticket costs about 25$ for both domes (flower and cloud forest) but you can stay for free in the Gardens by the Bay Area where the huge flower like statues are.

It's a huge area with many different plants and flowers which can be discovered within half a day.

You can get there via Taxi.

We enjoyed Gardens by the Bay and will for sure visit again if we come back to Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Very Beautiful. Cloud forest is a must watch. Dont miss the Sky Walk for a new & different experience.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Nice place to wonder around, worth seeing the light show once. Gets very busy but does have a nice atmosphere. We went just before sunset in time for the first show so seen it in daylight and dark."
Gardens by the Bay,5,I love everything about this place. 💖
Gardens by the Bay,5,The view in this garden is awesome! There is a connecting bridge from Marina Bay mall.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Oh wow!! I loved this!! The cloud forest and flower dome were beautiful as you can see, you will need a few hours to get around the whole place but the real gem is the sky trees light show at 7.45pm! The lights and music are amazing, I felt like I was in Avatar! Such am surreal experience, definitely one of my favourite experiences of all time!!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,One of the best places to visit in Singapore. Impeccably beautiful at night.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful gardens, very clean and colourful. During the heat, take your own water and/or small snack as touring the whole place can take a while to walk around. Alternatively, there's an audio shuttle for €8, but I preferred to stroll around at my own pace. Recommend the sky walk so you can see the surroundings from high up above. There's also a fun water spray part of the park for the kids so take their swimming kits along.. I'll post a pic of it in the pics section."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"One of the must visit places in Singapore. There are two domes at this place one, flower dome and other one is cloud forest. I would recommend to start with cloud forest because you will love atmosphere in there. In cloud forest, you will be welcomed be world's second largest artificial waterfall in the world. Then you will find a lot of information and magnifying glasses to see and get knowledge about different plants. While in flower dome, you will find flowers of the whole world. And if you visit after 4 in the evening then you can enjoy light and sound show on the artificial trees. I am giving this place 4 stars because it will exhaust you by the time you will be out."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"A good place for walking, running, and cycling. Kids friendly."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"INCREDIBLE!!!!! If you are a Singaporean, then take a bow, you should be so proud of what your country has produced!!!! The Gardens By The Bay is a shining example of what a tourist destination should look like and offer.
Words can not describe how incredibly beautiful this area is. You have to visit it to understand how amazing this place is. You have the Flower Dome,  Cloud Forest, Garden Rhapsody, and the parklands themself.
One thing you have to do is watch the evening light & sound show at the Graden Rhapsody.  Its such an incredible spectacular and must be on your list of things to see and do while you are in Singapore."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is the most beautiful place in Singapore. There is a light show around 7.30 pm here. There is no entrance fee for garden except flower dome, cloud forest. Go there in the evening."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Even though this is man made, you can see the plants are thriving ... Great place to unwind with greenery and flowers...

Although I do wonder whether they should have park ranger to control number of people to enter at per 2 hours, so that it won't be overcrowded and also easier to ensure no irresponsible visitors destroying the plants"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Unforgettable musical light show surrounded by the incredibly fabulous trees. The show put musics from all around the world (including Jay Chou from Taiwan!) together and recompose them into a comfortable chapter. Not sure if the show takes place every night. Really fortunate to enjoy it totally without expectation.
The most recommended way to enter Gardens by the Bay is through the sky bridge from 6 floor of the hotel besides it. At first, you can have the panoramic view of the whole garden, and as you walk deeper into the forest, suddenly you are in the amazing atmosphere just like in movie Avatar! Huge plants, trees and insects make fantasy. Quiet moment and mysterious lights send you into a different universe. Few words are best. Just make sure not to miss your only chance experiencing another world!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A must visit for tourist visiting Singapore. There are so many places for nice photos and if it’s too hot, tourists can visit the air conditioned flower domes for seasonal flowers and as well as checking out the indoor waterfall. A great way to spend one full day and then dinner in Marina Bay Sands. Visit my ig@blackivory"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"For free, you can enjoy the super tree groove (better at night), for day activity, can visit Flower Dome and Cloud Forest (paid). I absolutely love Cloud Forest, the fountain is breathtaking and you also can walk on sky bridge. There is free wifi and also air cond dome so its not hot."
Gardens by the Bay,5,This is the most futuristic garden I’ve ever seen! Go there if you love the combination of nature and futuristic buildings with extraordinary light shows.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares (250 acres) in the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden (in Marina South), Bay East Garden (in Marina East) and Bay Central Garden (in Downtown Core and Kallang). The largest of the gardens is the Bay South Garden at 54 hectares (130 acres) designed by Grant Associates. Its Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Good for what it calls for but nothing that can amaze you or make you feel out of the world. Good to see that its ultimately man made and well maintained. Found it to be just another commercial tourist spot
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is definitely worth the trip if you are there fir holidays. Bring your young children. They will have fun walking, running and playing at the children’s garden. Lots to see and do. Nearby you have the Marina Bay shopping complex. Easy to get there, just take the MRT and get off at Bayfront MRT."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Reminds one of what is at stake in our fight against climate change. The delicate ecosystems on display here are rapidly vanishing across the globe. The cloud forest dome offers an aerial view of the enclosure surrounded by mist.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visiting the gardens including the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is the best thing we've done in Singapore. It was both enjoyable and educational. Also, the Dome and Forest were maintained at a very comfortable temperature; not like typical greenhouses. We spent about 4 hours there in all."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"The place has so much to explore. Both, flower dome and cloud forest falls under gardens by the bay. This place has some beautiful dragon fly and bull creation. It looks simply beautiful during night when musical show takes place. Must visit place for everyone."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I am surprised to see such a beautiful and man made park very close to nature ,so beautiful,must see, should visit in evening and must stay till night,means must look in day light as well as when drakness grow.i appreciate Singapore government."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Must Visit tourist place in Singapore. One can climb up the Artificial tree shaped poles(Natural trees are planted on these poles) for breath taking views. The light show here which happens at 7:45PM everyday is Fantastic and breathtaking. You have to take ticket to climb up.
No ticket to watch the light show. Restaurant is also available on top of the tree if you prefer to have a cozy dinner.
The light show runs for 15 minutes."
Gardens by the Bay,4,"Not that mind blowing, but it was great! There are lots of opportunities for photos and the view is amazing. The Garden itself is free but the Cloud Forest and the Flower Domes are not, but it's definitely worth it.

The Cloud Forest is entirely air conditioned with an artificial waterfall and suspended walkways. The Flower Dome contains beautiful selection of plants and flowers some of which are difficult to find in the wild here in Asia."
Gardens by the Bay,4,A good air-conditioned garden.. good place to be if you wish to kill some time.. very good place for elderly people and kids.. nicely made. Efforts are apparent..
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Must visit place💕
✔I ordered nothing just enjoy my time there. Marcelous place! In their park also there is Cloud forest and Dome.
✔The atmosphere was great! Especially in the night, many beautiful lamps. Many people do some jogging and exercise👍
At 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm you can see garden Rhapsody, beautiful lamps with many kind of songs... i really enjoy that time!
✔The service was great! Everything was beautiful. If you cant walking too far, you can buy ticket for shuttle service for about 3 sing dollar, so easy👌"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazing light show set to music. Treetop walk is cool. Do it, you won't regret it."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Nice show of light. Amazing lantern. Beautiful
Gardens by the Bay,4,many beautiful flowers
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Definitely worth a visit when you are at Singapore! You need to pay for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, but well worth it. It would be good idea to get stamp for revisiting as the scenery should be very different between day time and night time."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This experience was spectacular and I used 2 days to enjoy. Walked around the lake and took so many photos of the foliage and fountains. The second day I paid admission to the exhibits. The botanical variety was from all different climates of the world and air conditioned to enjoy so much better. The cost of admission was about $20 EU. I say approximate because I don't remember exactly. You can look it up online. The Holland exhibit was not finished yet to showcase tulips, a disappointment. I waited til a Friday afternoon for the paid part and the exhibits were crowded. Go early during weekdays to avoid the crowds. Even early afternoon is less crowded. There are giftshops and restaurants in several locations. This is a huge complex. Acres and acres of botanical joy."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Wonderful. Especially in the night. It is beautiful. SURROUNDED with Garden and premier horticultural attraction for local and international visitors, Gardens by the Bay is a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry that presents the plant kingdom in a whole new way. Come to experience it."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place to explore and walk around, even for just an hour."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Excellent...one of its kind. You can spend 3-4 hours marvelling at the hard work that curators have put in making this an out of the world experience. Evening 4-8 pm is a good time to visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Singapore is filled with Incredible architectural seats and the gardens by the Bay are absolutely included in that list. Free access to such a beautiful place Wis orchids everywhere and incredible sights, you can't miss it even if you only have one day in the city. Walking into the cool Misty rainforest where is the world's tallest waterfall drops in your face is a sight to behold."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Greatest adventure ever. May lose ourselves inside the garden. Breathtaking nature
Gardens by the Bay,5,The place worth visiting. Very positive experience. My family and and friends enjoyed very much at the last visit.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visiting the cloud forest was an interesting experience. At the start, one is greeted by a beautiful indoor waterfall. As you make your way around the first floor, you will then have to take an elevator all the way to the top. The journey then continues by circling round the premises and gradually going down level by level. And throughout it all, you will be surrounded by gorgeous flower arrangements and view of the city."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place, nice garden, peaceful and quiet. Must see when you are in Singapore. You can visit the area and look for free without going inside."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Where you can find a very beautiful garden, very nice to see, including flowers that were unique and not easy to find.. Never enough pictures to capture them all."
Gardens by the Bay,5,We were lucky to be there during the holidays and caught the Christmas show. The light show and the food stalls made it so much better than the last time I went. They did a great job lighting up the sky and dazzling the audience with the music and light show. The energy and excitement of the season was perfectly captured here!
Gardens by the Bay,5,Lovely place in Singapore.. Must visit
Gardens by the Bay,5,Fantastic free gardens that brings an interesting and scenic oasis of calm in busy Singapore. Catch the light show at 7.45pm for an extra wow factor
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Visited last Friday with my mum and had the best experience ever! Beautiful installations by #dalechihuly at strategic places at #gardensbythebay #glassinbloom harmonised so naturally and beautifully! The service staff is as always wonderful, making the experience so delightful. A special shoutout to Mr Yip who shuttled us around and took time to explain and answered our questions about the displays — my mum had difficulty getting on and off the shuttle, he was super thoughtful and attentive to ensure a pleasant and safe tour for us and another couple. Kudos to Mr Yip and GB 👍🏻  I would go again.. for the experience which is so uplifting!"
Gardens by the Bay,4,This is nothing like what you've seen before. Pictures would not do justice so you have to see how beautifully it's laid out. There's an opera show that happened twice in the evening. So it's a music and light show around the Supertree Grove area.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Its a nice and cool place and lovely😍😍😍
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing experience! View from the top was impeccable. Really interesting walking and discovering the indoor dome waterfall and gardens. Finish it off with a drink at the top of the hotel.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A huge amazing man-made garden! The supertree show, the flower dome and the cloud forest are really amazing! I like being inside the garden because it’s cold and awesome. We are shown various kind of flower and plants, I love it!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I went to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome; both of them are fascinating and amazing. It was extremely refreshing to be able to visit enormous greenhouses in the middle of a developed-crowded city. One thing for sure, I would definitely come back here and recommend my friends and family to visit Gardens by the Bay; next time when we travel to Singapore. Two thumbs up!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,It is modern type of manmade top class park with super light show and walk in the sky. One should visit in evening and should not miss anyway light show held twice.
Gardens by the Bay,5,Beautiful gardens within walking distance of Marina Bay Sands and the Bayfront MRT. Must visit if you are in Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay,4,"It is just beautiful! Only problem was that the light show at night was not working because of some technical problems.
The actual garden was breathtaking !"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Amazingly beautiful! Too vast to cover. Better to go at opening time to cover all the places and lastly to see the light and sound show. Beautiful flower dome, many rare flowers to see. Has a sky walk to see even above. Praise worthy"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay is a wonderous place for young and old. The spectacular lights display of an evening is a must-see when in Singapore and the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome can occupy you for ages, showcasing thousands of plant species from around the globe."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This has to be on your list of things to do in Singapore, it's fantastic! Allow plenty of time and make a day of it taking in all of the attractions. We started with The Cloud Dome which is an amazing insight into rain forest life, followed by The Flower Dome (if you're remotely interested in plants, don't bother if you have no interest or you have tired children) giving lots of photographic opportunities. You should also visit Satay by the Bay for refreshments, the locals say it's expensive but it's actually reasonable value for money and there's something for everyone! Finish up with the light show on SuperTree Grove and your day is complete."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"A great place to visit and stroll through. Paid bus shuttle available at entry to help with getting about, entry to exhibitions is extra. Nice to visit and wander about the gardens even if you have not paid for full tours. Pedestrian access available to Marina Bay Sands."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This is an amazing attraction in Singapore and I have visited here twice within five months, once during the day and once for the spectacular light show...not to be missed. Fantastic amount of plants and information, we didn’t have time for either of the domes but the night time show was awe inspiring, moving and something I feel really privileged to have seen, this and walking around the gardens is all free.You could spend days here and not see everything! A must to see in Singapore!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,The Gardens by the Bay is a great experience. My partner and I explored the Flower Dome which has a Disney Christmas theme. The Cloud Dome was our favourite out of the Domes. Due to the amazing views on the top ramps and you work your way down the levels of the dome. Afterwards the garden surrounding the bay and the walk is really good. I recommend doing this at night and don't forget to walk across the Helix Pedestrian at night. :)
Gardens by the Bay,5,Gardens By The Bay is huge beautiful natural garden in Singapore. Non residents entrance fee $28 for adult & $15 for children.You can enjoy magical colorful light show on the evening. Its Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world.
Gardens by the Bay,4,Amazing lights show while playing classical music. The area is well designed with statues and clean. There are shops there to buy food and drink but they are quite expensive.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Really awedome n amazing. The park charges S$8 per entry to see the lights night time. It is worth it, but they could have given for free instead"
Gardens by the Bay,5,You have to visit .. you will love it .. day or night .. always amazing
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Lovely place. Will definitely be back. Great walk, to dome and cloud."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Beautiful gardens to walk about and relax, like So galore extremely clean. Well worth s visit.

The light show in the evening is stunning with many people visiting and watching the show."
Gardens by the Bay,5,Amazing experience. Will definitely come back. There were some really cool events too.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"So happy I went to this exhibit. The buildings are as masterful in the design an construction as the plants an flowers inside are spectacular. There are many many kind of flowers and plants. It's very beautiful place to visit when you go to Singapore. The rain forest and flower park are amazing, the walk is very pleasant and a good guide to all the intricacies of such ecosystems. So worth a visit to this lovely garden."
Gardens by the Bay,5,It's an incredible park and should be the envy of cuties around the world. It's free to enjoy and it's just beautiful. Also there is a giant baby statue that is apropos of nothing
Gardens by the Bay,5,I love this place. I can learn and admire so many flowers from around the world. I am sure you will feel peaceful here. It was on Christmas :) really nice decoration
Gardens by the Bay,5,A very good place to visit in Singapore. Is totally different view from day and night. At night there will have a light show named  Garden Rhapsody. It have 2 show at every evening. …
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Great place to visit. Amazing plants and you can feel fresh air everywhere.
The first impressive thing is a extreme big artificial tree at front gate"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Night visit to this awesome place. Enjoying plants, water, animals, lights at the same time."
Gardens by the Bay,5,"Orchids knowledge and appreciation at this orchid extravaganza, eye opener for me as o have never seen so many different varieties of flowers besides orchids. So glad to have brought my folks here for a cool and relaxing walk in the gardens."
Gardens by the Bay,4,Improve lighting if you want to open at night. Quite dark at some area and might be dangerous for solo walker.
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I visited Gardens by the bay twice and always amazed by it themes. The last time i visited, the theme is Floral Fantasy where all the garden fully of many flowers hanging at the top and planted everywhere. They exhibited 3D shows about Gardens by the bay. And at the night i watched their light dancing shows. Beautiful!"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"I love every inch of this place. I love Flower Dome, I love Cloud Forrest and OCBC with Supeetrees.
I am very grateful and appreciate that Singapore consider about Green world. Even though it's expensive but, it's worth to visit and supporting what they are doing to this place. I can't stopped to say ""Wow"" whole the time. Varieties of the plants are very good. I couldn't stop to taking some pictures every corner, every leaves and everything. I can tell that everyone happy to this.
I spent whole day from morning to evening.
You should consider to buy online tickets so, help you from queue especially public holiday and the weekend.
You can pay a transport whole day with only S$3 per person.
I am kinda Botanic junkies so, it's my heaven. Hopefully Indonesia can have like this someday.
We should care about climate change every year that our Earth is getting warmer.
Would love to write some more but, my pictures could tell more than my words. ❤️💚"
Gardens by the Bay,5,"This place is unbelievable.

A garden of this immensity and precision curation is mind boggling. An absolute must do for any visit to Singapore.

We spent hours in the climate controlled domes exploring all of the gorgeously curated gardens and we’ll definitely be back!"
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"This institute is a sight to behold in tiny Singapore, and so too are the students, coming from various nationalities and races, and in their very own individualities in always and dressing. Every angle of this building is interesting. It's almost like this building is made up of many layers of monoliths."
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"Lovely place for art enthusiasts. The blocks are arranged opposite each other with an open space in the centre for a myriad of activities including musical performances, etc. An awesome place to chill out yet protected from the sun and the rain. Ample parking lots in the basement and a stone throw away from eating outlets. Convenient."
Lasalle College of the Arts,2,Loving the short courses with a great lecturer but  it is impossible to connect with the administration. Feeling lost at their lack of communication. When can we start the next level?
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"I passed by this amazing looking building very frequently whenever I am at bugis area.
Glad that today I have the opportunity to walk around and admire the building.
It's is a Sunday and happy that it's not crowded, it's almost empty and I can easily capture the photo of the building.
It's not as big as I expected and maybe if I have the opportunity to visit this place again during weekdays, I will like to see the arts activities taught in this college."
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"A non-profit, private arts institution offering over 30 diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in contemporary arts and design education. The iconic LASALLE College of the Arts, spanning two campuses – McNally and Winstedt, is designed by RSP Architects Planners & Engineers. Architecturally unique and incredibly gorgeous campuses!"
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"I enjoyed my time over there!
I went to the liberally and it was awesome!"
Lasalle College of the Arts,4,Love the architecture and various inspiring art related courses offer to public.
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"great school, great buildng, great design. This building complex has an innercourt that allowed public for access there. The facade of the building makes the building looks like a sculpture or an artwork, rather than a college building.

Some crafting opening in the facade as an ornament for the solid facade outside. The inner facade to the innercourt widely open that every people can see each other in that area"

Lasalle College of the Arts,3,A private academy of arts in Singapore
Lasalle College of the Arts,5,"I was just passing by on my way to the hotel when I stopped to check the vicinity. The facade was modern and simplistic. There are boxes in the wall which some people sit on and relax. I did the same and rested for a good half an hour since I've been wandering around the city for the whole afternoon. Lots of young brood are coming in to pursue their passion. I had a great time watching people come and pass, and started thinking deep inside my mind."
Lasalle College of the Arts,1,"Apparently some kids here aren't taught basic manners. Walking side by side on a narrow path blocking others from going in the opposite direction, not even bothering to move aside."

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Damn quiet due to lock down...Guess the store cannot last too long also. But the old architecture is still nice for me to take pictures.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Landmark of Singapore. Very well located among beautifulskyscrapers, unfortunately maybe because the covid situation many stalls closed. The variety of food is not the best. Looks beautiful fully renovated."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Vibrant and ambient atmosphere..the food court is so huge and a variety of food is available. A not to miss place is the satay street. Do visit the place at night. Would highly recommend this place for family and friends night out.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Good side:
Visiting this historical place is still not bad.
Have lot of empty seats (lots of empty store also)
Plenty of choices

Bad side:
Those promoter very aggressive, make people feel uncomfortable.
The food really not impressed me at all, I think if only for eating, may go to most of the food court will do.
The price also at the high side."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Singapore is going back to Phase 3 HA, so dining in hawker out is made possible.

I was looking for a place to settle my lunch and unfortunately not many stalls were opened due to Covid-19. And so I decided to settle it at this Indian stall.

Chicken briyani, with the most simple and usual sides.

Taste wise: the chicken is very soft and tender, but can be better. As for the rice, it is unexpectedly fragrant. Spreading the curry all over the rice is a brilliant choice, delicious! Do support the stalls here if you ever chance upon La Pa Sat

Price point: $8.50

Location: Lau Pa Sat

And of course I do not stay around Lau Pa Sat."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Does not only serve the lunch crowd, but this prime location serves midnight cyclists as well. Transformed into open air concept at night with many satay stalls and a beautiful skyline. Something different for the typical heartlander, great!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Normal market place.. Perfect time to come around 5pm till night. Halal foods. But there are also lots of people drinks beers. Must be goods if they separate the table or having the halal and non halal area. Have try their satay set. The taste goods and prawn used also fresh. We also try cockles and stingray, this two just nice."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the most famous and nicest hawker center you will find in Singapore.
Mostly you will find downtown offices staff as well as tourists in this place.
It was my daily goto hawker center when I was working in Downtown area.
Walkable distance of less than 5-7mins from Downtown MRT and Telok Ayer MRT, 8-10mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT
Wide variety of different cuisine stalls and most of them are good.
My favorite obviously 😄 is the AS Indian cuisine stall, mostly all items in this stall are authentic tasting.
If you are going to go regularly get the Kopitiam prepaid card from machines or Kopitiam counter, it gives 10% discount on food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Telok Ayer Market,  also known as Lau Pa Sat now considered as heritage building , you must come down to feel the ambient.

Many selection of nice food and drinks. The Satay only open at around 1600hrs. Enjoy having the satay at the heart of the main road which close when they start selling.

Unfortunately,  I could not show you any of the food as I just taken a big meals downtown. Just happen to be here . Bring back memories when I was younger.  Cheers! 🤭🍸. It use to be very hot and sweaty but now with the giant fan ...cool 💦💨"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"This place is packed full during lunch and dinner hours.
Worst time to ever visit.

Tried the Western store 's smoked duck Donburi.
The rice is not even Japanese rice, the sauce was too salty.... But the broccoli was not that bad. For $8.90 I would have gotten something else..... :("
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great Satay & Grill prawn stall 19
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"It's a must do if you want to get a feel of Singapore. We ordered the Satay from stall 7 (the satay stalls are not all halal so we double checked for the ones that were). We had a mix of lamb, chicken and prawns - really enjoyed it, and the atmosphere of the whole place. The experience is great"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A very nice place to eat and there's a lot of food to choose from and the architectural is so beautiful that you will admire while eating.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good place to hang out with friends after work or weekend activity. Lots of foods and beverages to choose. Satay is the main ""killer"" here. 👍🏼👍🏼"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Food is good and with many varity.

There's a Filipino food I tried. The boneless fish taste not bad. Personal find it a little too salty."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"[Covid Review] During this mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated friends, being unable to eat indoors, lau pat sat is a good alternative to chill and hangout. Because it's a ""Hawker"" Environment, when you're not expecting music, the music ban does absolutely nothing to build on the ambience here :)

Food wise, everything we ordered from random vendors turned out great and flavourful! Would recommend if nowhere to go with unvaccinated peeps."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"If there's one thing I know, it's if you go to Singapore, you go to a hawkers market and the best one I went to hands down was Lau Pa Sat. It's in the heart of downtown and offers a ton of variety and walking distance from Marina Bay Sands which I was staying at.

As the market is open 24/7, it's at night when things get cracking. This huge outdoor food court is known for crab and stingray so I had to try them and they were both amazing. It can get busy so make sure you go find a seat first and then go around to the vendors to get your food.

I would definitely come back again when in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Now that it's reopening after the Pandemic period is getting over, its good to see shops coming up. Its good multi national cuisines. Its kept clean, I think the table and chairs have also been revamped. Overall good to see people around."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Lau Pa Sat
•
Generally I think the food is good! 👍 The prices are a little more expensive because the target audience are towards working adults and a place for tourist to visit!! 😆
•
Apparently the Hor Fun is famous. To be honest, it just taste not bad! There's a long queue for this, I wouldn't wanna queue ah!!🤣😂
•
Remember avoid coming here during lunch time! It's super crowded!! 😑 You won't be able to find a seat!!! Go before 11:30am! If not after the lunch peak period! 😌

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,a food paradise for those who loves late night supper. There are so many food to  choose from
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The legendary place. You have to visit. Every weekend there's a satay still barbecue on the street.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Always to go stall no 1.. the satay is really nice especially chicken satay.. the peanut gravy also taste great n the service is fast even I go on Sunday..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The cockles' chili tastes so-so. The satay was affordable but the gravy was rather disappointing. With kopitiam card, you could purchase food and drinks at discounted price."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Been to Lau Pa Sat several times. Don't really get what's so great about this place? Satay was just alright... had better elsewhere. But this review is about this particular stall - ""Lok Lok 69 & BBQ Chicken Wings. Giving 2 stars but only cos this is about Lau Pa Sat. If it was just for this stall, i would give them 0 stars. The only reason i got wings from them was because they were right in front. Not only were the wings not cheap, they charged for takeaway too. Sure, i might have waited an hour or so before eating them. However, not crispy is still fine... these were chewy and rubbery. They were so disgusting that i just tossed them into the bin. I'm sure even my dog wouldn't want them. Don't buy the chicken wings from here."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Hawker food. Old world charm. Distinctive heritage culture.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,After the renovation earlier this year it has become pleasant place. Used to be very touristy but pandemic has set an end to it. Plenty of stalls you don't find at the usual hawker centers. Prices a bit upmarket but still reasonable. The open and airy design doesn't let you miss the airxon.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"You will get the best Singapore culinary experience if you visit this one place, no need to go anywhere else at all, you get the most authentic Singapore food experience, in the evening the road will be closed to place foldable tables and plastic chairs and freshly prepared satay with beer will be served. Amazing experience. Must not miss if you visit Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Lau Pa Sat is a great Hawker Centre with good clean food in a great location. Visited a few times 3 years ago, happy to return.

What I like:
* great fresh food and drink
* close to nearby businesses and transportation
* nice architecture and seating opportunities
* clean and well kept, good hygienic standards

What could be better:
* it's definitely one of the tourist favorites -> hence very crowded
* certainly pricier than most hawker centres you can find in Singapore
* halal options are vastly more limited than most other hawker centres

Overall a nice place to visit as a tourist, but make sure you visit other hawker centres as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"You are going to feel like VIP at this food court especially as you walk through it to get to the skewers lane outside. You are approached with restaurant workers left, right and centre; with menus in your face. It was a great and fun experience overall - contributes to the atmosphere. We saw lots of tourists here! We ordered one of the smaller set options with beef, pork and prawn skewers. After we finished the skewers, we headed back inside the food court for dessert!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A major monument from sg's colonial times. sad to see it become a tourist trap. and even sadder to see it become a ghost town now under covid.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great food especially satay stall 7 and 8 🤗🤗
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I really love the atmosphere of this place. I admit, it's a bit of a tourist-targeted place compared to other hawker centres, but I enjoy the diversity of food options here. They've done some renovation work since the last time I've been here, so there are a lot more corner outlets with shops and air-conditioning. Overall a good place that I would recommend you visit at least once."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A good weekday lunch choice 👍🏻☺️
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good place to enjoy BBQ foods
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food...great service...great atmosphere to wind and relax after a hard's day work 💕
The satay was delicious n the gravy was superb😍😍"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Love it cause it is one of the few open air market (food court) which can found in Singapore. And of course for the good food and unique building design! Also know as the famous Lau Pa Sat!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Covid has really taken a toll on businesses here. Barely any traction and few stalls left operating.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Satay overpriced and sauce too sweet. Amazing British colonial architecture though and plenty of other good food choices.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the must visit place to eat while in Singapore. Delicious fried Laksa, nice Pork bun and very fresh sugar cane drink. cheap food with delcious taste. Lau Pa Sat is the best."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Not so crowded, quite nice, would be better if the live band can be brought back :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place to have my meals! 😋👍🏻
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Crowd dropped alot since COVID
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The place is recently renovated. Excellent food court with a variety of options. The food is cheaper. During the weekday afternoons will generally be crowded due to the lunch hour crowd from CBD.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice spacious hawker centre, prices a little higher than non town based hawker centre. Great place for satay under the sky in the evening."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Traditionally the tourist go to for hawker food and I’m sure it will be be again. Slightly more expensive than neighbouring centres but also with a broader choice.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Renovated food court. Cleaner, new look and feel, great atmosphere."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Grear Variety at reasonably low price...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Delicious cheap Hawker food. Some will say it's too commercialized, but I didn't mind- it was a lovely dinner.

I had some delicious chicken and rice, tiger beer, and fried carrot cake. You go and pay at the individual stalls and then sit outside or at any table. It is a nice social place at night"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Local food, large spaces and well organized. It’s food are town prices so it will be slightly dearer than at local hawker centres. Still good as it opens late/24 hours."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice. A good place to hangout with friends for a madman session.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"We loved this area. The food was much cheaper here than teh local restaurants, and there was plenty of stalls to chose from. There was adequate seating and it was an easy place to find.
The food that we ate was very tasty and full of authentic flavours.
As a tourist feeding 3 kids this place was a god send. It's also close to the rail network and toilets are close by."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Quite a lot of the stall are empty, but still have plenty of choice. Very few halal options, and i think only saw 1 vegetarian (indian).

Decided to try the hot plate rice, 99% look, smell and taste like pepper lunch’s.
Beef pepper rice cost $ 6.80, if you hve kopitiam card get 10% disc too.

Expect office employee during lunch time in weekday, might a bit hard to find a seat.

The only downside if this eating plce is, the bird a lot more than regular hawker and often flying on the table."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"All the food are delicious!
Recommended to come here with your colleagues and family."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"No matter what, still the best Prawn Satay in SG"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"The new shops are awesome! Great display and store designs. Great food too.
Love it! Well maintained! Friendly staff."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Great choice of restaurants and great food but never leave your meal unattended, even for a few seconds! I went to buy a drink and when I came back, some birds were eating my kebab"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"The best but also more average food.
Satay were really good, charsiew noodle depends on where you buy.
Anyway, a place to try (evening time)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Loving the Satay at this place. Best of the best! But you better be careful coming over on the weekends. Its going to be packed and very hard to get seats! Would recommend those who are looking for Satay in Singapore, this is the place to be!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Went fr dinner late one night after work and i was surprised to see the place so new and vibrant following the renovation. The place is bright and welcoming. The tables are clean. There are many stalls selling various cuisine you name it eg. Korean, Indonesian, Philippines,  Indian, Chinese and Western etc. Also a ton of satay stalls outside w outdoor seatings. I was craving fr some naan so this was from Briyani Point! Set includes 2 vegetables, chicken masala and 2 pcs of plain naan at $8. You may opt to top up $$ to upgrade the plain naan fr garlic or cheese naan. Very filling! Will definitely be back again :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Whole new experience change of aesthetics. Cooling too, was not at lunch crowd. So to visit soon after heighten alert and dinner too."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Lovely food. So many cuisines. I ate Indian food. Will make a youtube video next time i go again :)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Good satay and barbeque seafood.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"The so- called ""best satay"" from 7 /8 stalls really disappointed... We ordered the set B with BBQ prawns, cost $41 that come with rice cakes the store owner proudly claimed it ""free"". Worst thing is the prawns is NOT FRESH AT ALL!!! The satay u can get better one somewhere else with that price. Ming Yen BBQ & Seafood is another store that claimed they are the one serving seafood in Lau Pa Sat that totally disappointed with price set for the tourist we reckon.. foods really taste awful...
With Lau Pa Sat claimed as one tourist spot in Singapore that serve that kind of foods, I wonder what will the ""world"" think of Singapore!!! Please people totally avoid the place..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"So many choices, so many good food. Atmosphere is very good and some stalls will invite you and give their menu to you for you to decide. Very spacious, a variety of food, what more can I ask for"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Once Asia's largest market and then food court, you'll find almost every cuisine"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Very touristy after 7pm. Good satay btw
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Another one of a good late hangout spot for dinner or supper in a hawker style environment. The uniqueness of this place is the outdoor seating on roads which are functional during the day. Typical Singapore dishes can be found here including satay which I think it's one of the best around. Highly recommend satay from stall 7/8. Seafood dishes are also offered from different hawkers. If you're around in the area at night, swing by the spot and grab a stick of goodness!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best satay here in Singapore. Go to the one in the middle of the street you will not regret!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great selection of foods to chill out with friends.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Been awhile but Lau Pa Sat has not lost its taste. Love the juicy Satay from Stall 9 and BBQ Chicken from Lok Lok stall. Affordable too!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Renovated place, a bit less attractive than before, good food but now it is a bit too pricey.
Good place for satay in the night"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,super good mutton satay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The old Lau Pa Sat hold great memories with wide array of food from  various communities in Singapore....  Busy day and night especially late in the night....
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Local Singapore Hawker Centre Food.
Many varieties to choose from.
Got to come here a number of times before you can succeed in trying all.
The best is the satay . Must try Malay dish."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Food is not bad, can be hard to find a seat sometimes. Quite warm as well, but for tourist you do get that authentic feel."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The outdoor satays street is interesting and satays are delicious too.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place to eat and hangout in the center of the city
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Quiet now this covid period compared to those days. Satay & stingray are good
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Lovely architecture in a historic market. Good food the whole day and night.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Such an amazing food court , wow! Soany choices. I recommend trying small meals and snacks from different stalls. Don't forget that there is an inside and outside area and both have delicious food !"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Known as Lau Par Sat (老巴刹), they will legally close up a road at night to place more tables. A place where you can enjoy some local delicacies such as satay and zhi char (煮炒/热炒) Just be prepared to get touted by the people there only."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,So nice
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice place for eat , lot of choice"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The satays are delicious. Lots of other local & western food & also seafood
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Decent food, good atmosphere, clean and airy."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice market to spend some time if you're a tourist!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This place has improved over the years. I used to avoid it due to the heavy touting going on around. These days, the stall owners are not very pushy in getting customers to buy their food. Although there still some visible signs of it, I enjoyed the affordable seafood choices here. I'll let the photos speak for themselves on how yummy the seafood dishes were."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Absolutely delicious food. Great value. The Laksa was incredible.  The Indian stall was really good. After 7pm they close the street attached the market and start serving delicious satay. A must visit.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Food for everyone in the middle of the financial hub. Lots of seating and very affordable prices. Evening onwards they close one side of the street and it becomes a heaven for satay lovers. Must try experience in Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,A decent food court to try local food at very affordable prices. But the food disappoints. There are better places to try Singapore cuisine. Place is comfortable. Lots of tables and seats. BBQ area at night.  Tourist-friendly.  You really get what you pay for.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Beautiful spot in the heart of CBD for good food and cold beer
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Newly renovated. Many stalls still not opened. Must try is the Satay!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"My favourite place for street food and satays in Singapore. Really liked it, food smells great, everything was socially distanced, and their satays, they were exceptional. However some concerns could be regarding hygiene. Important thing, do carry sanitizers/ wet wipes as it will not be available there, and tables may not be sanitized after ones usage. However, food wise, it was all fresh and made on the spot, tasted good, but prices were quite high/moderate, which is understandable considering the fact that it's in the CBD. if you are going to come here, just do note it is crowded, so if you are trying to avoid crowded places or don't want to socialize, not the place for you."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,This place remind me of my hometown....stall number 3 is my favourite
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Have not been there since years ago when i had the hokkien mee and fried oyster with egg. Not very nice then. Visit once recently, the oyster egg is crispy and shiok. Just the chef has more time to prepare quality food. Definitely will go back again when there is little crowd."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"So far, Lau Pa Sat is the oldest and the prettiest food court in the city. I love the structure of this building. Before, they used to be 24hrs opened but not anymore, a few stalls only open. Their famous satay stall opened until 3 am, I think because few times I  came here, they already packing up. Love having breakfast here before heading to Raffles Quay shopping mall."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Been going back here over the last 10 years when visiting Singapore. Great spot I know there are others that are just as good and maybe better but Telok Ayer at Night becomes amazing experience sitting outside when the shut the side street. Ordering plenty of food to share and being with friends and family. You can see plenty of business staff come here to catch up and relax after work have a beer and food. Perfect setting and easy to get too, there is a huge amount of options for food available too and drink so no problems if you aren’t all fancying the same food! Last Photos Taken September 2019"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Large and popular food centre near Raffles Place MRT station. Huge selection of food to choose from! Don't get lost! My friend ordered chicken rice as well as duck and pork to try. We also had a seafood based noodle dish. Everything was very tasty and reasonably priced. I recommend visiting a food centre (hawker centre) when in Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Come here for satay! Sit out the back if you can and soak up the atmosphere (and the grilling smoke! Yum!)

There are so many different stalls to choose from with all sorts of different cuisine. Singapore's melting pot of cultures is really embodied by its hawker centres.

I'd recommend the grilled stingray, chicken wings, satay skewers (of course!), and some sugar cane water with lemon for a refreshing break from all the meat!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Second only to Maxwell Hawker market... Will definitely be back! Tip: later at night or outside main hours it's much more pleasant due to the popularity of this place.😉 We had the satay skewers, stingray and chili crabs here. Amazingly low prices!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best satay that I have try so far~ stall number 7 and 8… must try
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,On the wind down it seems ahead of a refurbishment? Difficult to tell. The food touts are a nightmare. Depending on where you eat you can have some tasty treats but the pricing is a bit above average for a hawker. Clearly for the businessman and tourist trade. You can do better.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A great experience visiting the place. Lots of different types of food and cuisines.

They are open all through the day and some of them are open till late at night.

A must place to visit as the food is cheep and great. You can get anything and everything from around the world.

It is more famous for the Satay which is available on the road side."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Dinner time was relatively quiet. There is a decent choices of different food. I had Thunder Tea, it's quite good. The place is cooling with the many huge fans. Good place to take your dinner and unwind after a hard day work!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Place to get some authenticity in terms of food and dishes. Make sure you stop outside to get some BBQ sticks 🍗
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Not many choices during lunch time weekend.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,Relatively with little customer & very quiet. Most stalls u closed around midnight
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"it nice place to lepak but not for food.
it only have satay as halal food.
it satay was nice but like no other choice then that.. have like 5@6 stall with same satay🙄"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Go for the Korean Cuisine at the corner. 👍
Like all the K-food here especially the KimChi. Always get back a box of KimChi before going home.

We patronise their stall from Orchard cineleisure to here."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,This place is made for Supper! Satay from stall 7&8 is delicious. Wash down with Teh tarik.. Fuhhh! Nice...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great food court with a lot of choices. Not expensive, quick service but a little bit unrelaxed staff from the different food counters. In the end it worked out the skyscrapers are great to look at. I would go there again and I think it is good to enjoy all kind of foods."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Satay stall no.7 & 8 aka Best Satay stall has the best shrimps and satay gravy. The shrimps shells are 80% removed which makes eating them a breeze.

Addendum. My friends wanted to try the other stalls and stalls 1 & 2 they did try their satay. They regretted it and said stalls 7 & 8 are much better in terms of gravy and the satay itself."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Newly refurbished - new look, new food. If you are local go check it out and explore!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Fantastic place to grab a cheap bite to eat. Good amount of variety, plenty of seating, and nice and clean food stalls. Definitely worth dropping by for a meal."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Omgggggoshhhh....stall 8....satay is out of this world....the peanut sauce is a 10
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good value and good quality, right next to work :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Wanted to catch late dinner after a play. Reached there at 10 pm. Not much choices left. However, the satay saved the day for us. Delicious and reasonable price of $0.70 a stick. Took less than 10 minutes for food to arrive"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Many food stalls in this hawker. It is one of the most clean and organize hawker centre. Price is a bit more expensive than the other one.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Stall 6 Satay is the best so far. Would try other stalls if they are good.

Personal preference. But only thing I would say is that the satay is on the sweet side."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Amazing place with very tasty food at the places we went. We had satay chicken and prawn sticks, pad Thai, and a super tasty salad with chilly. Also sugar cane juice and watermelon juice was amazing. For desert a shaved ice more like snow with milk, topped with nuts and bubbles."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the best hawker places I have been to in Singapore. It’s quite large so you have many stalls to choose from. This center has Korean, Japanese, Malay, Chinese, Singaporean, and many more types of dishes. The large bell that makes a sound at a certain time is an added awesome feature. The neighborhood is a busy district."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,You have to try these hawker food at least once. Plenty of yummy options and economical. The ambience is beautiful and can also choose to sit out in the open. Don't forget to try the satays.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Currently half of court under repairing process.. looks empty now a days compare to before covid situation..veg food also available here..😀
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Many food options even from various countries.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Best. Skewers. Ever. 🍢

This place is amazing, such a gem in Singapore. Ate so many mutton skewers that even my stomach gained weight.

Hut 7 is the best!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"It’s primarily targeted more for tourists, chicken rice ranges around $6 which can be pricey. The interior is air conditioned though, which is rare for a hawker centre.

If you’re in the area and want better prices, head down to Market St Food Center, which is five minutes away."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Ate the koka noodles from the ah ma sheng mian & mee hoon kueh stall is great, the soup very nice😋"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Local food in a nice clean environment. Of course the “main attraction” should be to eat satay at the street with a cold tiger beer 🍺... maybe sting ray as well. Also, go enjoy the architecture of the market who is very nicely renovated. A local architecture jewel."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice ambience for an alfresco dinner. Alternative to Newton Food Centre for a lovely meal in a cool evening.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,One of the best hawker centre in the heart of the city.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Another great hawker dining experience on offer in Singapore. Plenty of options available all for a very reasonable price. The beer here is even pretty cheap for Singapore standards. Check out the pig organ soup and chicken feet if your feeling adventurous.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Lots of stands to choose from. Came here for lunch. The Indian and Thai were good. Some of the Chinese options (not photographed) were unfortunately not as good. In the center there is a juice bar, which is very good and fresh. Apparently, at 5PM there are vendors on the street with satey."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,One of the best places in Singapore for street food such as the popular satays. it is open until midnight when we were there on Saturday. Reached there by taxi around 11:30pm and there were still a few people and most good sellers were still there.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"When I came on weekends, it is usually very crowded. However, I came today (Monday), place was empty and it was super fast to order and eat my food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Bit touristy but if you want satay skewers and cold beers surrounded by hundreds of people with towering high rises, this is the place! More food options inside the food centre. Prices are a little more than other Hawkers"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"As one of the oldest and most famous hawker centre, many people have recommended the 7/8 best satay, however, some other stores’ satay were also nice. And hawkers inside are good as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Some interesting stalls like kebabs and Chinese noodles but the rest is pretty much average fare that u can find at hawker centre but with a premium for the city location.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Decent place, but be very selective.."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Touristy, food is okay. Good location for meet up. Would recommend going to other good centers if u want tasty food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great satay, and lots of choices at a reasonable price. Many tables outside to sit on, but there are no fans for the outdoor satay seating. The stalls offer many different types of satay. Inside you can also try other types of food"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Yummy satay on the street!!!!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good to try the local foods at Singapore.
It opens at 7pm and all the foods stalls are inside the market but you just sit in the tables placed on the street.
Love this place for the food tastes at Singapore.
As you know, Singapore is pricey anywhere."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Simple old fashion food court - many options to choose from at very affordable prices
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Tourist trap prices but pretty decent satay.

Visited during covid so there was minimal crowding."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,It is incredible view to walk by the street in this huge towers. And multiple cultures are mixed 🙏🏻
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best place to have satay for supper.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Had a great time. Good food and clean inside! And also the food is cheap compared to others nearby. Come in with an empty stomach and just fill it up with the variety of food available here without burning a hole in your pocket. Take it as an insider tip😉. The crowd is amazing, mostly travellers like me!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Definitely one of my favourite places to get local food in town. Always get the satay and oyster omelette. Food is amazing and it’s nice that they recently renovated the place. The toilets could be nicer.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,One of my fav places. Laksa at Seng Kee Local Delights is a must have
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I think the skewers are the best pick!!!! Satays are the only right food here :D
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Of all the food stalls this was not my favorite because of the sheer size. This location is HUGE, inside and outside seating. It’s in the hub of the city, but the food options repeat (just different vendors) and it doesn’t feel as unique as the smaller stalls.
The BBQ that’s made outside was the BEST. I don’t like meat alone, but this was my favorite dish of the evening.
Seating is hard to come by. It can be warm because of location and lack of working fans. Bathrooms easily accessible. Wheelchair friendly."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,The Indian Mee goreng not so nice but satay still ok
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice place to chill and eat satay.
Had a wonderful time eating supper with family.
Good place to have a late night dinner/supper."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Different variety of food available.
Normally, tourists would love to dine under stars. Because one of the road beside Lau Pa Sat will be closed at 7pm. And it will be transformed into dining area.

The satay is good. And do try the chicken rice. There are 2 stalls selling chicken rice and both are equally good.

There is also a clean toilet for visitors."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Although a ""food court"" doesn't exactly sound like a wonderful cultural and historic experience, that's exactly what this one is.
Lau Pa Sat, a landmark for Singapore foodies, is a historic building first constructed in the 1800's (it has been renovated numerous times, but the last renovation sought to restore it to its original historic form). Delicate Victorian architecture mixed with food hawkers calling out their wares is a perfect clash.
Cheap, delicious food in a lovely setting."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good food court in center of Singapore with lots of food options for all kinds of crusines . Sea food is available too.onenof the few picket friendly options available in Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Decent, overpriced food imo. Great to chill and have a good time with your friends though - spaces here are pretty big"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good Indian food options. A little too oily sometimes but mostly authentic and tasteful.
Try the Delhi express and Shree Ganga"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Its a iconic place. If you are tourist you should go at least once. Else, they are many other places that you should go for better local food. For example the nearby Chinatown Hawker center"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Losing abit of its vibrant compare to pre COVID19 time.  Go away COVID19.
Satay still good though"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good lots of variety foods shop to eat
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lots of food varieties, good ambience"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Fire up the barbecue for some smoky juicy satays! I have not been to Lau Pa Sat in ages but when some overseas friends wanted satay in the late night, where else? So many to choose from and all claiming to be the best 🤔. We decided to give Alhambra a try simply cos he said his dad was from the original satay club. Well, it was beef, mutton, chicken, 2 sticks of prawn & 1 stick of tripe to go with 3 ketupat & onions, cucumbers & pineapple pieces! I had not eaten satay for awhile & this turned out to be surprisingly juicy good! We all enjoyed it and I would certainly eat here again although i just might try others to see how they are too!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of my favorite spots in the city! Delicious, cheap satay and beer with simple, unpretentious, outdoor seating in front of a historic hawker centre (former wet market) but with towering skyscrapers of the financial district in the background. Great food, great view."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A great hawker spot! When I say it has a wide variety of dish, it really has! You can choose from Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino cuisine and so much more. The prices vary but you can definitely find something that's worth every dollar. Plus, it is ~quite~ near the Esplanade Bridge (you have to walk ~quite~ a lot but it's worth it) where the Merlion Stand and where you can view the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. A great spot to stop by when you're hungry and is in budget. Would definitely come back if I had a chance!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Quite a bit of hype over this fd court .. but a lot of the stalls hv chgd .. at 830pm, only half of the stalls r opn .. the roast duck was quite good, altho the stall owner was quite abrupt & curt, not the friendliest .. on the contrary, the chicken rice stall tt also serves chic curry laksa was very friendly & let us sample the delicious curry laksa gravy b4 we ordered .. it was good .. my fav was the blk sauce carrot cake .. this fd court also has many satay stalls .. we just tried our luck, and found the beef satay juicy & flavourful ...

A decent place for a tastebof local fare ..

And this victorian-style bldg used to be a train station & still has its original clock tower, wh chimes every 15 mins thruout the day / nite .."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Turkish Lot 70: falafel better than those we've had in Spore so far. Salad was crispy and fresh even tho it is almost 8 pm. The two stall holders seem Middle Eastern & serious with their food. Come and enjoy!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Awesome food. You'll get all the good stuff. They close off one street at night for the satay grills. They are to die for. For breakfast go to Bake Inc. best waffles and eggs tarts in town with all the other goodies.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Adorable building. You feel set back in time. With all these huge sky scrapers around it is stunning. We came there on Chinese New Year, not too many stalls were open but still enough to choose and have great lunch for 4-5€ per person."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good range of food choices. Plenty of space despite covid (some tables cannot be occupied) but need to go before 12pm. Need to use kopitiam card no option to use qr code to make payment.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Historic food court in Singapore, with food stalls from South East Asian and south Asian cuisine. They also have stalls selling  beers, drinks, desserts etc. Lovely ambience. A must visit food court in Singapore, especially for the Satay in the evening by the street. One must experience this while in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Actually it is a very touristy place. You can sit outside or under the roof. You can get food from any food vendor it is well prepared. You can also order at the table. Vendors offer their menu cards, it is a bit more expensive than getting it yourself."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Couldn't get a wider range of cuisine anywhere else. The choices are literally infinite with each one better than the other - Thai, Turkish, Malay, you name it. All basic facilities still available. Although it gets very crowded in the evening and night."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Very strong peppery pork stew with garlic. Nice!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The duckmeat was tender, but the sauce overall was quite mediocre, nothing outstanding here. However, the portion is suffient to fill you up. The soup didnt taste much of boiled poutry in there, saltiness was the lasting flavor lingered on the tastebuds. I visited on weekends during lunch time, the ambience was quite peaceful, clock bell chimed every 15 min adding so much to the quiet CBD hot lunch spot."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Eat traditional and new hawker faire in a restored 19th century architecture, smack in the middle of CBD. Oasis for relaxation any time of day."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Amazing street food market at this location. Being here you need to try the hainanese chicken. The chicken is absolutely melts in you mouth including the breast meat.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very good food with very good price. Roasted pork with noodles is highly recommended!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Decent selection of food, but the quality is only mediocre. With the endless supply of tourists that descend on Lau Pa Sat like it's the temple of all hawker centres, it's no surprise that most stall vendors here don't care to give good quality or good service. The majority of their customers will never return anyway. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by for a bite, but if you're going to make a trip just to visit... There are much more solid options across the island."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Former Telok Ayer Market (now known as Lau Pa Sat) opened in 1823 and was a timber-and-attap structure located on the shore at the western end of Market Street.

By 1830, the structure had become dilapidated and was deemed extremely unsafe. In 1833, it was replaced with a new building that was constructed according to the design of Mr George D. Coleman, the first Government Superintendent of Public Works, who assisted in the planning of early colonial Singapore's town centre.

In 1879, the market was demolished due to a land reclamation project at the Telok Ayer Basin and relocated to newly reclaimed land at Collyer Quay.

Municipal engineer James MacRitchie designed the new market and construction began in 1890. It was completed in 1894.

In the 1970s, plans were made to transform the vicinity of the market. It was officially renamed Lau Pa Sat in 1989 after a Mass Rapid Transit tunnel was laid underneath.

The building's entire structure was dismantled while tunnelling work was carried out. A few years later, it was reassembled piece by piece and reopened as a festival market.

The building's Victorian cast-iron elements are among its defining features. The elements were prefabricated in Europe and crafted by an iron foundry in Glasgow, Scotland.

The clock tower is arguably the food centre's most iconic feature. It is home to bronze bells and a jacquemart or a figure of a bell-striker, produced by a bell foundry in the Netherlands. Both were installed in 1991."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great selection of food. It's a tourist hawker center, so prices are a bit above average but still cheaper than air-conditioned food courts. Try the satay street. Order a lot because the each satay is like 2 bites."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lau Pa Sat is within walking distance from two MRT stations and a few bus stops in the area, or you can walk from Marina Bay (15 min). The food court is open till near midnight. Price-wise the food here is a bit expensive but portions are big and taste good. The architecture is another huge bonus to visit Las Pa Sat besides the authentic local food. Definitely recommended for tourists to Singapore who want to experience the local food culture."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"It's a nice place to have Singapore local food at very cheap price in casual atmosphere.
Although it's cheap, the government checks the cleaness of each restaurant so that you don't have to worry about the quality of food.
Also there are many restaurants so you have lots of choices of food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A bit of a tourist trap, but still the satay was good."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Visit on 8 Aug 20. only 30% stalls are open. like noodle. kebab..tried Thai food stall and LanZhou beef noodle.  good!  We should support this legacy hawker center during this special period.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great food. Famous place for tourists.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place for satays and all kind of local foods
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Hawker center with bunch of different foods to try. Has one or two halal places for the Muslims out there, one is pretty obvious with its signage. Other stalls may be too but just couldn't tell! You can grab satays from the outside court/street area. You should be able to grab food you want from inside and take it to outside, but pretty sure I saw a sign on another day saying not too...*shrug*.

Grabbed some chicken rice. $5 or there abouts. Cheap, as far as I'm concerned. Would go again. And again..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Touting is outrageous. Its literally everywhere. Food is pretty decent though
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lots of food. Touting has gone down in recent years and with covid, but is still there. Crowds are manageable. Food is a little pricey which is to be expected at a touristy location like this."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Maybe you really need to know where to go here; but found this pretty underwhelming. Tried a few different stalls with dim sum; rice; fruit, etc. Nothing really that tasty. Looked for something that was popular with a lot of people or had a long line and couldn't find anything. That said; there are a lot of different types of choose to choose from. If you are traveling from abroad; the men shouting at you to sit at tables can be ignored; all the seating is open so they are just trying to entice you to order from their stand."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This hawker centre is quite nice. But it is kind of weird to see this single storey structure sitting amongst all the other skyscrapers in the inner city.
Quite a lot of food to choose from, if you can't decide what you want I'd suggest you take a walk around and see what's most people having and order the same thing from the nearest store."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice Hawker Center in Singapur. Definitely worth to go there. In the evening you could even sit autside and there is a barbecue area. I recommend it!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Most of the shops were closed.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Prawn Hokkian mee is nice !
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very good plave for hanging out with friends and having some beers. You should try the satay and the grilled stingray
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Photogenic place.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place. Many food options
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Cool place, but very few people were around. Food was very reasonable"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"If you want authentic regional satay, you’ll enjoy more bang for your buck at the Lau Pa Sat food festival, a.k.a  “satay street” held nightly after 7pm. Satay Beach near Gardens By The Bay is also good, but not as accessible as this spot in the center of the business district. Multiple vendors. similar cooking styles. There is a slight variation in satay flavors among vendors, but you will not be disappointed with any you might choose. The chicken and beef I enjoyed was well marinated, slightly charred outside while remaining moist in the meat. $7 for 10 pieces - it’s a modest and decent quantity of flavorful protein you can eat for that price. Prawns and mutton are also options as well. There are enough tables to fine as a large gathering with audible conversation. Family platter meals seems to be the preferred way to enjoy a satay experience, especially when you have someone to share with."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Came here with friends for satay , chit chat and just enjoy the night and the surroundings."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"I always love coming here ... Great hawker market. Had some wonderful dumplings, fresh noodles and killer satay. It's always an adventure in food here, in a great setting."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"My fav place to visit there is a western food super nice. forget what is the name. cheap and good, worth trying"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Centrally located hawker with lots and lots of choices for food. On weekends at night they close one of the streets facing the hawker and lots of satay bbq stalls are opened. Delicious food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great atmosphere, but beer is pretty ex. Only sell by jug @ $22"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Somewhat of a staple for the business district of Singapore, albeit also a bit of an attraction for tourists, the Telok Ayer hawker center is a good place to get decent local food.  As well as a more budget-minded option for eating than most of the surrounding establishments in this part of the city.  Many new dishes can be found, as well as the old favorites that Singapore is famous for.  Not open in the morning, come for lunch with the office crowd and dinner with the imports.  Or just walk through to ogle the ironwork."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The spaces due to covid-19. The food at satay stall 3 is superb.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice hawker centre near Marina Blvd. Yummy roast chicken rice at an affordable price
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"It's reopening was a quiet affair. Few knew it was undergoing rejuvenation and even fewer knew about its reopening. This meant only a few stalls were tenanted and operating, making it a very disappointing experience. Less then half the stalls were operating but the very fact that the selection of food captured a basis spectrum of food kind of salvaged the situation. In typical clockwork literally and figuratively, the gong of the mechanical clock still goes off which brings back memories as well as interruptions to conversations. Memorable and a one-of-a-kind experience."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice place to eat, so many halal food. Alhamdulillah. But you have to ask first. Not too expensive and the food so tasty. 24hrs food court market."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Had various choice of food. I love it. And also good for hangs out with friends & beers. Worth to try. But if you're looking for ""halal"" food, better ask instead"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A treat to the stomach. It has got huge variety of food from different parts of the world. I had had the Thai food for the first time there and it was appetite satisfying. A paradise for food lover.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,People less here maybe bcoz of covid-19. But the food is quite good.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great satay, come here for dinner."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A lot of BBQ satay options outside the main building. The stall employees are really aggressive so don't be afraid to tell them no or to keep looking. Even after you sit down, other employees from other stalls will still throw their menus at you.

The inside is a decently clean hawker center compared to other places."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The greatest food centre in SIN! I found lots of great foods here
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,delicious Asian food for reasonable prices.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Variety of choices food court. It's really convenient since there is a kiosks to top up the kopitiam card. There is even a convenient store, cheers at a corner. Lunch period is really crowded, this time only troublesome to find a seat."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I ate chicken rice which is know as famous food in Singapore. You will feel the local atmosphere even there are many foreigners there. You have many choices there.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,This place is only for tourists. I would think Newton is a better choice.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,I went past 7pm and it was a little quiet with only a couple of shops that were open!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I loved the ambience of Lau Pa Sat especially the area outside except that there are people smoking. The satays are good and tasteful. They are also open even at late night which is a good thing since most of stalls in other hawkers close early.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"This was on a Thursday night.  Food was pretty good not the greatest but worth a gander.  So. Cold Tiger Beer, mutton, chicken and prawn sticks with some Malay Yakisoba.  Recommended beer garden!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Seafood stores are overrated. Portions ordered is not valued for money. Satay were good. The satay set of 10 Chix + 10 Mutton + 6 prawns for $26 is a good deal & the prawns were beacuced well. To get a parking lot is still a hassle but possible within 15mins.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good variety of food. Nostalgic place for older folks.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Excellent food and quite cheap . I recommend !
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the oldest and most iconic food courts of Singapore. As a tourist if you had to get a feel of what the old food courts were like in this city, this is a place to go. It was shut a few years ago for renovations. Much better since it has reopened. Most varieties of local food available here. But since it’s a tourist favourite and in the middle of CBD area, it has all kinds of other cuisines also. You’ll surely find something to eat here. A bit pricy than the heartland food courts but still affordable. They close down the tiny lane next to it and that becomes the satay Street to try some freshly grilled satay also."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Wide arrays of foods! Satay, seafoods, and everything you can mention. Desserts and beverages too. Make sure bring along friends, those package of satay and orawns they offer you won't be able to finish alone."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Wide selection of local and regional foods, mostly at reasonable prices. In the evening the street is even closed to cars and tables are set up next to the Satay stands. I had sime hesitation with sfreet food and hygiene, however this proved unfounded. A visit is worth it and recommendable."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Perfect place for first time Singapore visitors which want to experience a hawker center for the first time. Close to the Marina Bay in a beautiful building. All the Singapore must eat dishes are available and tasty. Of course a bit more expensive then a regular hawker center but still more then ok and more spacious and relaxed then other hawker centers.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place for dinner for cheap food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Lao Pa Sat is a place every tourist that visits Singapore should experience. It's busy, hot, crowded and full of amazing aromas from the many different food stores. The variety of food and cheap prices make it a popular place at lunchtime when all sorts of people flock to get their lunchtime bargain before going to back to their daily activity."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Visit around 11pm. The place was a bit crowded but it’s a good place to chill out in the open air area. Not sure which satay stall we ordered from but the satay were just so-so. Not coming back again.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A night out here always feels like an occasion. Never miss the satay here with a good cup of Teh Tarik.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,AKA Lau Pa Sat.  Great hawker center.  Street outside turns into a satay paradise.   You can find every facet of Singapore street food here.  Conveniently located very near the metro in the center of the city.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"This food market is a must-visit if you're in Singapore. The place is so huge, with Victorian-style architecture and artistic details. The food stalls offer so many options, but you wouldn't want to miss the satay alley after 7pm. Try the fried fish soup too, the auntie who sell it was a very nice lady and the soup tastes so good! It would be a perfect meal here with friends on weekend or after long hours at work."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Vegan Economy Stall available. Affordable meal.
Hot and stuffy thou. Bird flying around.
Dirrty chairs"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A good place to to have good attas food and a ice cold beer
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"1. Great options food
2. Nominally priced
3. The sign boards at the satay section mentioned not to carry outside food but I could see people doing that, so that rule isn't set in stone.
4. Beautiful view of the downtown from this place."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Wonderful place for night dining with friends
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"I love this place - great setting, lively markets and generally great food. It’s one of those really iconic Singapore things you have to do on a visit. But be careful; we had food poisoning from the prawn satay there last Saturday night. Beef, chicken satay seemed good but the prawns were floury and we should have stopped at the time. Enjoy these food markets, but be careful with the seafood!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,A pretty disappointing food court as a number of good stalls have disappeared. Need to look into putting better local food variety into this centre since this a attraction in the business city district. Wake up man before remaining stalls run away
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice Satay & Street food here
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Experience not to be missed. Amazing food at average prices with a great environment. The whole place is pretty busy, noisy and fast paced so if you're not into that then probably avoid it. But for those of you who like an adventure, excitement and street food then this is the place for you."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Bbq stingray, prawn sate and po piah is delicious... BBQ Stingray is very populat at lau pa sat.."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,One of my favorite spots in Singapore! You can get food from so many different countries. Good quality and even cheap. For example a simple Laksa would be 4 SGD a pint of Tiger beer 9 SGD.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice ambience. Slightly pricey but this area of Singapore food is always a little pricier.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Every time I asked a local in the Marina area where to go for local food this is where they told me to go - and they were right.
I’m sure this is for the tourists but the food and beer and place itself is great - giving a lovely hustle bustle atmosphere but also feels safe and food is awesome plus cheap. Therefore I think if that’s Wahaca you are looking for - a must go.!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"the best! forever and always! great food, really nice atmosphere... I can‘t wait to come back again"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Lovw curry from an Indian food outlet
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Love the food here,  Satay is the best, pepper carb is good but not cheap."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"WE came here back in October of 2019.  When we first arrived, there were bbq vendors all around the outside with picnic benches full of people.  I wasn't expecting to see so many people outside.  When we actually went inside the center, it was actually quite quiet and empty compared to all of the activity going on outside.  I also noticed that maybe half of the stalls were closed - perhaps we had arrived too early for dinner.  There wasn't much selection however because the food is so affordable and delicious, we were not disappointed at all.  Unfortunately we came here on our last night, but i would have loved to have come back to visit and have more food"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"It might be a bit touristy (I see way more Westerners than typical) but hey if you're staying/working nearby for a while this beats eating at the hotel by miles. Prices are still way closer to hawker center ones, and it's nice and quiet on a Sunday morning"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Not so good..... Small scale food court is better~
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Beautiful rotunda amongst the heart of the city. Hawker food inside is solid, satay skewers outside are a little touristy..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I usually don't like the concept of hawker centres. But this one is very different. I liked it for its cleanliness and the variety of cuisines it provides. Plus, there's a food street right next to it. Great location too."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Most of the hawkers here are overpriced and mediocre, however, there are some hidden Gems so you need to look carefully"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,LOVE THE FOOD HETE
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The food court is special as it emerge within a church structure in the middle of city. Food is not bad, we enjoy the seafood. But at the back at satay street there’s too many stall and ppl selling the same thing. One of the drawback is the toilet hygiene is really bad maybe the worst one I came across in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good food over there though a little expensive compared to sattelite towns.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Extremely packed during weekday lunch time, where you can witness the uniquely Singapore culture of reserving a seat using tissue packets. A clock tower stands in the middle of the food centre, which traces its roots to Singapore's early days.

A lot of food choices here, though it may be pricier than a typical food court. Best to visit this place outside of office lunch hours. There is also a night section beside the market that opens only in the evening."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Enjoyed our first Hawker centre meal.  Satay St. opens adjacent at 1900.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Honestly I didn't know it was called Telok Ayer Market, I've always referred this place as Lau Pa Sat. I love the satay, prata and also the environment here. So glad that it was still open till late night.

It's a great place to chill with friends after work, or in my case, dance classes. They have an ATM in the premises and also a 7/11 store right beside so it's pretty convenient to withdraw cash.

Just wish there's more halal food here. Nonetheless, I would still continue to hang out here with my friends."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Better now with new management.  Love the Thai food store!!  Great portion and tasty
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"So my family and I came here at 8pm for satay, we ordered from one of the stalls, our satay took more than 30 minutes, dad went to cancel and we got our refund.

So Dad decided to choose another stall. The girl who served us was so polite and courteous. My dad was suppose to order 10 of each meat, but accidentally order 30 of each meat, she said no worries, she will do changes....

Kua was really nice as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Pretty good selection of food stalls. This hawker is quite spacious and conveniently located. All of the food that we ordered were very tasty too. I would recommend this food court for tourists who wants to try out authentic asian food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Multi Cultural Cuisines - Indian, Malay, Chinese, Korean, Western.... The speciality here are the satays - In the evenings they close a side road,  and satays are served on the road..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great variety in food, come after 7pm for Satay. Love the Satay, you will find your own personal favorite stalls! Take your time to try new things and have a good look around. La Pa Sat!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Nice satay here, but beward of crowd and forcing u to buy satay"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great place for dinner - it gets pretty busy but there is plenty of seating. No AC but huge ceiling fans keep you cool. Huge selection of different food stalls.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Open air food cout. Alot alot variety of food. The drink stall is at the center and one side of the food court. Reasonable price. 10% discount if use kopitiam card. 3 points top up machine. Expected very crowded when lunch time specially weekday. Do come early to chop table. Good service by staff and cleaner. Recommended!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"With a complete makeover, this place has become better than ever before! When it comes to food...Think it, get it, enjoy it! everything, multiple cuisines..all available here!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"a little bit more expensive than your typical hawker center, but this place is quite large and has good variety of food available. the open air dining at night gives it a nice festive vibe."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"No comment about the noodles! They were good and 5,30$ is more than a fair price for all this. The problem are the beverages in the center of the food court. Those women terribly lack of sympathy and served me a coke that wasn't even cold. When I came back to tell them and ask for ice they charged me for the ice! I find it really scandalous since it's not my fault! Would rather die of thirst than buying a drink there again! Totally unprofessional!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Fabulous place for food.  Huge selection to meet your taste buds.  Had the best chickpea curry n roti ever
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Never go wrong with chicken satay and a glass of sugarcane juice
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Looks nice, but nothing really interesting. Poor food quality in all places I tried."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Sad experience coz phase 2 begins at 12am. Cb ah garmen cb
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Love the spicy chicken satay here. Not all sells spicy chicken. Very delicious..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Food is delicious and a must in Singapore. If you are looking for a cultural culinary experience, then this is the place. 🍴🍽🥢🍻🥡🍲"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A must visit food court in Singapore !! Enjoy the Satay and Pepper crab. Even India veg food is good
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Beside the ambience, there is nothing interesting about this place, even though there are varieties of food.
Sadly, this place has become too commercialize and it ismore suitable for tourist.

The food looks good but the taste has fallen beyond autenticity of the real Singapore standard. Tourist may find the food acceptable but as a Singaporean it is definitely unsatisfactory.

It misrepresented the true essence of Singapore hawker cuisine...

The satay sauce has to much flour which robs away the peanut flavour, the Char Kway Teow is tasteless, and Hokkien noodles lacks the prawn taste.

It was a disappointed evening and truly regretted bringing my foreign guest and friends here...

Goodbye Lau Pa Sat, goodbye to authenticity..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Amazing places to tase the local foods! Awesome. and if you dare, try the thunder tea rice, the tase is unpredictable. You will get the soup(made from tea) and the noodle filled with healthy ingredients, such as brown rice, carrot, cabbage, chili, nut, and etc(sorry i don't know what other names inside). Trust me, you will get surprised."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I've been here many times over the years as it is walking distance from my office. Many varieties of food to choose from.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Still have lots of good food on a Satur lunch. 👍👍👍
Place is very clean and airy..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food option when you’re near the area.
Better option than Makansutra if you’re coming from Marina Bay Sands."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Full of fun loving people eating satees. Nice place good atmosphere open till late.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great hawker centre than has been renovated.  Good local food.  Little pricey for hawker food but great central location!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,It just went through a major renovation and there seems to be little to no halal food in the day with exception of the satay options.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Amber seats but the Chay Kway Teow is too sweet.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food, lots of options at great price point. Centrally located so one can always walk down to MBS and enjoy scenic views.. breeze around can make up for a perfect evening."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Had some of the awesome satays. May be had more than i should have. Would love to visit again
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Excellent street food . Visit stalls 7 & 8. As well as the little tea kiosk for tea tarik.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Tradition old fresh market transformed to a food heaven for locals and foreigner. This place served meals throughout the day. You can find local food of chinese, indian and malay, seafood; plus japanese, korean, middle east, vegetariant, fusion and many more. Or even to come here for a cool beer! One will definitely be able to find something that can satisfied his stomach needs. The next time you are around Raffles Place, just pop over for a surprised meal!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"awesome place with great choices of food we tried stall no 7,8 and 10 we liked 7 but it was really busy at that stall and sme.other food from inside it was all great and cheap as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Most stalls are closed due to covid, but do support the stalls that are open! The hawkers are very friendly and the food is greatt"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The indoor food court is quite nice with plenty to choose from however unfortunately my chicken, duck, and buns were warm, bordering on cold. The one thing I loved about it is its proximity to Merlion Park and its much cooler and open than other hawker centres. ""Satay Street"" outside is a nice experience but severely overpriced for the portion sizes compared to other places in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Exactly what I wanted to find! A busy hub of street food, lots to choose from, really cheap, locals eating there too so not just there for tourists!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Newly renovated so the place is rather clean and well ventilated. The food however, was expensive. There’re a lot of empty stall/booth and not much variety of food available."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,wonderful experience of having satay on the street and other south eastern asian local food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lau Pa Sat, also known as Telok Ayer Market, is a historic building located within the Downtown Core in the Central Area of Singapore. It is currently a food centre."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Standard place to bring foreign friends for local food. I prefer to sit inside, it is much cooler surround with Big Ass fans !"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"It make me feel like I'm in Malaysia night market. Eating by the road, satay & maggie meet goreng."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Popular place in Singpaore and also people working in this area.

A little smoky. The rest are good and lots of food to choose."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great for late night feed, plenty of seating. Beware of the guys hustling you with menus, you can find the menu items cheaper from the actual hawker joint"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,fav food court in Singapore. must try their grilled stingray fish at the stall near the satay street. and also try their oyster omellete.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Walked from the Merlion  to this well known CBD food court. There are so many choices of food. The one place to taste the best of Singaporean cuisine at very excellent prices  for tourists on a budget.  A must place to visit. Lunch time is full of city office workers and one has to wait for a vacant seating.  Go before the lunch crowd.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"I am referring to Boon Tat street. The satay and the mee gerong was good. What's better is the pricing is very fair. Except for the Chinese Zi-Char stall, the service and attitude of the stalls I like. I really like the mutton soup. Is one of the better ones around these days."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice casual, for some very local street food and a few tigers"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Good satay, but the sellers pounce on you as soon as they see you.  Also, it's expensive."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place for street food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This place has many different alternatives of food. Indian, Thai, noodles, western, seafood. You have many different choices. Even my home country 🇨🇷 Costa Rica has a place here. Prices are super accesible, nothing fancy with a good taste."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice food and drinks. A place close to financial center of Singapore. Where locals as well as tourists enjoy meals from Asia and more. If you happen to be close by or feel like trying out good food don’t hesitate. Advice: avoid lunch time, it will be really crowded."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Came here and bought the satay. It was okay.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Good experience and some evenings they have satay. Up market hawker centre, variety of food although can be mixed in quality and also pricey. Toilets best avoided in the evenings."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,#1 fixie meetup spot 🤣
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,It is opposite Paris Baguette. Still some portions undergoing touchups and renovations. Not all shops are open.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good place for satay during the weekend. Food service is a bit slow. Prices are slightly higher vs other night food markets
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,It’s a unique place when compared to the usual Hawker centres in Singapore. It’s a stunning building with history in the midst of all office buildings. There are quite a number options for vegetarian food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Was sitted outside when it started drizzling heavily.
Shifted in doors.
Satay was awesome. Not much malay food except for one halal Indian food and lots of satay.
If u are coming for satay, u won't be disappointed. But if other palettes, best to head off somewhere.
Toilet quite confusing as Lau Pa Sat is roundish, hence need to walk one round if u miss the sign.
Relatively new and clean indoors. Many huge ceiling fans all around. Cooling not stuffy."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Best satay stall 7&8 , at Lau Pa Sat ."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Those who visit Singapore for locals culinary must visit this market. Named lau pa sat from hokkien “lau” is old and “pa sat” is market. Many foods to try and they selling sate. This place was taken for crazy rich asian movie, where colin and aramnitha took nick and rachel to eat some local foods. The ambience is very nice, feels like locals🤗 best experience"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Cool place in downtown SG for local foods.
Somehow I found other food courts in the local neighborhood have better food then here.
But you can eat bbq on the streets between those skyscrapers is a cool experience in SG indeed.
But so many vendors will follow you and try to bother you to buy form them :( Quite annoying.

Try some other hawk centers while in SG.
Maybe they are not as famous but I have better experiences elsewhere."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Generally a great place to be if you want to sample what Singapore hawker food has to offer. Just watch out for peak lunch and dinner hours. Make sure you ask about the prices before ordering at seafood stalls. You won't want to be surprised by the bill.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good for tourist who wanna try local food in one place.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food stalls, a tourist spot. Must try the satay street next to SGX in the evening time."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"very crowed place. so, second order prepare late and rosted not perfectly"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place in CBD for food!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Delicious, easy, quick to receive orders"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Too much hassle but fortunately after renovation it's airy with good ventilation.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Yami yami very yami
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"One stop location for local food. Prices are not the cheapest but it is a nice place to bring foreign visitors, especially the outdoor area that is closed off to traffic in the evenings and satay and other food stalls open for business. Shop around and ask for prices before you order."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great bbq after 7pm at the back street
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Variety of local cuisine available
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Food wise comments and price quite high which manages by worst kopitiam management
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Wonderful satay. Only negative was the sellers at the fruit stand in the middle of the court were rude & unnecessarily rushed. Getting there a bit before 7, to see how they set up the tables & chairs on the road, was really entertaining."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,The chicken katsudon would have been better if the rice is warmer.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Generally more for tourists cos the market is historic. Some foods are nice. But a bit pricey for food court prices.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The food is great and the architecture too.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Best Satays I've tried in Singapore and nice chili crab. Abit pricey though for a food court.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Not all eateries are top notch but there are some gems, and satay ist awesome"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Must visit place in Singapore. Satay starts around 7 pm and is bustling with people. Better find a place early. Chicken was tender and tasty.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Me and my family had dinner there. Please go to Satay Stall number 1 and number 3. Their foods are amazingly delicious. Worth buying!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great selection of hawker stalls. The dim sum is pretty good and of course after 7PM this is one of the best spots for satay. Stalls 7 and 8 are personal favourites. Don’t fill up on sides - they’re not nearly as good as the main event! Be aware that the indoor area gets very crowded at lunchtime.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice modern refurbished hawker style food court, very clean and modern but still some character, big fans and nice and cool. Lots of choice of food to try"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Fabulous ambience in mid city
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great tasting hor fun from this stall, plus the chilli was absolutely fantastic!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Multiple hawkers with a different selection of Satay. A must try you are visiting Singapore!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"The well-restored facade of this striking landmark – situated right in the middle of Singapore’s Central Business District, no less – belies the years it has seen gone by. Built in 1824 to house a fish market, a meal at Lau Pa Sat today is satisfying not just in taste, but in the knowledge that you are dining in one of Singapore’s oldest existing structures to date. By day, this heritage hawker centre is a decadent masterclass in local food that is foolproof, fabulous, and packed with flavor; and by night, the street right in front of it closes to traffic for full-on al fresco seating; with a swift set-up that sees folding tables, chairs, and mobile Satay grill carts being pushed into place for business.

The bustling atmosphere and irresistible aroma of barbecue smoke has made Lau Pa Sat one of Singapore’s true stalwarts for a late-night chomp; and is exactly the kind of place you’ll want to hit for a satisfying satay fix."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place for seafood and all the local dishes and it's clean.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Good food, if you don’t mind these guys bugging you relentlessly"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Very impressed place, a smoking hawker center in between all the skyscrapers. Basically satay, go for the best one which is number 8"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,nice place to eat alone or with a group of friends. a lot of international stalls for variety to cater everyone's taste. food is very affordable too. people who work here are very nice though they intend to pester customers to buy from them which is just fine. its open 24 hours so that is a plus for those late night cravings. can be a bit hot during crowded peak times.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good food good atmosphere, good place for late night comfort food"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Mentioned in the Crazy Rich Asians book (not movie). One of the more picturesque hawker centers. Popular with after work yuppies also.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice food court with many food 👍👍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Historical place, excellent food court with wide variety of food stalls and you will get almost all country recipes. They accept kopitiam card for subsidised price"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Still loving this place! 26SGD could go a long way for 2 people
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Touristy and rather expensive for hawker food. The day time food is generally cheaper. The night markets are a tourist attraction, so expect pricey food that you can find cheaper elsewhere. However, it’s the only accessible supper place available after 11pm for the CBD district. Touting at the night market is very common here. Remember to bring cash. the tulang soup (lamb bone marrow soup) and murtabak at the Shenton road end is pretty decent. I think they only open at night during the night market."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Had some pretty good Thai food, falafel and dumplings. Overall it wasn't amazing but I'd definitely go back and explore. Don't leave your food as the birds come after it pretty quickly. A little dingy."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great supper place
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"It is a perfect place for my family to enjoy good food in the open area under the sky. The satays and grilled prawns are great food to die for and the food are delivered very fast. We find the place cosy and delighted that my family can relax with great chats here. Do pop by to enjoy good food and above all, enjoy the relaxed atmosphere with your friends or family"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice looking hawker, great stalls. Every day at 7 pm outdoor satay opens."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Historic hawker centre in the heart if Singapore which has intercontinental restaurants. Cheap and best place to dine.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"The oyster omelette here is really good, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. It’s a  dish of Teochew origin that is widely known for its savoury taste in its native Chaoshan along with Taiwan, Fujian, and many parts of Southeast"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Satay is good.
Drinks not."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good place to have lunch, lots of affordable choices. Some shops also open pass midnight"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food, perfect ambience  and good spot to recharge for cyclists passing through from MBS"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place to eat! I reccomend the chilli crab
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The xiaolongbao spot near street 7 hand-pulls the best noodles I've ever had in my life. Do not miss out on the Dan Dan noodles there.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,New stores are opening since CB p3. Glad to have more variety from P2
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Recently renovated, a number of empty stalls."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Other than Satay, u can many variety of food but all so so and quite Ex."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Many different stalls: Indian, Thai, korean, chinese... it ist also nice to sit outside. Cheap beer available at cheers minimarket."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Maybe due to COVID-19 many stalls no longer open😓
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"This place has changed alot since the last time I had visited and remember it.

Due to the worldwide covid pandemic, a number of stalls are vacant now.

Within the food centre, there are places that are sublet to businesses and have reserved seats for their customers. This trend seems to be catching on with the operators.  Areas for free seating seems smaller.

Hopefully, the food available there are good and are available at economical prices for office workers assertions the area."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Is a tourist place, the food just average but price is higher"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Satay not soft. No sweetness in it. Unsure which stall. Chicken no taste, beef & muttons were hard and not sweet."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great place to have meal with colleagues, friends and family."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Lau Pa Sat is being rejuvenated.  Eateries are coming back with new signage and stalls.  Encouraging to see the energy returning!  Renovations about 70% completed.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Lot of eateries..pretty good food and sexy buildings all around..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good Food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A good place for bonding with friends and families
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Tried satay from stall 3. Fragrant n tender meat.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Solid late night food spot where you can enjoy sitting outside and a variety of food if you're with a large group. This time we went for the Thai food and it was solid. Also cleaner than expected.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Historic location and building. Boon Tat Street which is adjacent to Lau Pa Sat, is closed in the evening with satay stalls opened for business - just like the old times but more orderly and cleaner.  Prices are ok.  The popular stalls are # 7 & 8."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"This 2 storey food market has one of best local food and I might say the cheapest in town area (CBD). It has the best local variety from the Malay nasi padang, the Indian briani and prata, the Chinese noodles and seafood and western food as well. A definite must go for all those food junkies..!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Super hawker centre. Try the duck and noodles and $2 chocolate ice tea drinks. Of course the satays on the street are super with Tiger beer and ice tea 😎
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Satay on the streets. Very fun and excellent atmosphere. There are a lot of stalls to choose from, and everyone of it is different. Take a walk around and you will find something. Teh tarik is excellent at the single stand in the middle of the street."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Really tasty street food. We had the satay and a fried rice. It was delicious
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A letter in the Straits Times today expressed the wish that Lau Pa Sat could be revived by allowing parking after 6:30pm.

So I’m not the only one who believes that if you put up restrictions people will tend to avoid the place.

Policy makers must not set their policies in stone but review them constantly.

Downtown is dead at night because you need to pay for street parking till 10pm.

Commercial buildings should also offer free or reduced parking rates.

Guaranteed people will come.

Try it.

Just look at Giant Hypermart at Tampines. Every day its car park is full.

Free parking that’s why.

If it starts charging, guaranteed fewer people will come. Why drive all the way there when you can shop at your neighborhood shops right?"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Revamped with many more food option and dessert
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Some of the best satay in town,  great food, great atmosphere, great company,  bundle or with a cold tiger and there is nothing better,  love it"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,An amazing lunch or dinner time place for the office crowd.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great choice for all kind of street food on a good price. On a site you can find different tipes satay.  Going to Singapore is nice to see this place and try the food they offer ;)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I used to work as a runner selling satay at Lau Pa Sat hence, my comments are useful for the first timer visiters, and who are looking to just eat satay.

If you are visiting Lau Pa Sat for the first time, there are a few things u need to take note. The satay stalls are all located along Boon Tat street, which is a road that is cordoned off from 6pm onwards just for customers.

You can choose to sit indoors and look out for runners walking around looking for orders. They will be more than happy to take your order and serve it to you.

If you want to eat at the outdoor area (which you definitely should, for the whole experience!), there will be a few people at the entrance leading to the street who will try to get your attention n pressure you to sit near where their stall is located.

Its a practice among the stall owners that when u sit at the rows in front of their stall, that means that customer is theirs and the neighbouring stall owners selling satay cannot try to snipe those customers the moment they are seated.

However, Lau Pa Sat is pretty much free seating - dont let any stall holders bully u into quickly ordering from them.

Most of the stalls there sell the same standard of satay as well - dont be fooled by paid reviews telling you that a particular stall is better than the other. Satay is satay. Trust me. They get everything from the same supplier. Its just the cooking method that may vary. Sometimes the best cook can have an off day too right.

For a couple:
Id say 10 sticks of Beef and 10 sticks of mutton satay for the first order. Chicken satay tends to be abit dry if ur not in luck. Satay cools down very fast and its best enjoyed piping hot. You can always order another round if its not enuf as the cooking time is very fast and you get piping hot satay. Yummy.

2 to 3 rice cakes is enough.
The rest are novelties. Prawn satay is expensive at 2 dollars a stick(last i checked).

You can set aside room for  more options to order any seafood or additional dishes like carrot cake or oyster omelette. The chicken wings are huge and i ordered ten when 5 would have been enough for two people. Noob.

Thats it! Hope this review will be useful to anyone visiting Lau Pa Sat for the first time."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place to find cheap asian food just beside Singapore downtown. Dumplings and satay very tasty
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A lot of foodsss... remember bring your kopotiam card there...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The seemed to have fluid opening times which was confusing. The satay was very nice. The chilli pork I got from one of the stall was meh and so brought down the ratings. Lots of choice when they are open!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Really liked it, food smells great, everything was socially distanced, and their satays, they were exceptional. However some concerns could be regarding hygiene. Important thing, do carry sanitizers/ wet wipes as it will not be available there, and tables may not be sanitized after ones usage. However, food wise, it was all fresh and made on the spot, tasted good, but prices were quite high/moderate, which is understandable considering the fact that it's in the CBD. if you are going to come here, just do note it is crowded, so if you are trying to avoid crowded places or don't want to socialize, not the place for you. However there are quite some things around if you are there, like Urban Roti(you can check my review for that too). Overall, deserves 4 stars, considering the food, service, and speed, but a setback in hygiene and crowding issues."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great hawker place. You notice it’s tourist prices here, but the food is very good. Definitely go outside to Satay street, where they close of the street and all the satay vendors do their thing.
Love it."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,So many food sellers here with affordable price. Worth trying!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Pretty decent food, lots of choices... but since it's outdoors, it can be a little warm..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,My fav food court in singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The food was great! The price was hella good! The people selling were so friendly and were keeping to the safe distancing measures. One of the sellers made fun of me because I asked them to take away in a funny way. All is well :)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the most charming place in Singapore hahhaa. I love street food, and this place give it all. There's Sate, seafood, and other street meal here. This place is considered pretty cheap by the locals. But the taste is so good"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place for food lovers.  My favourite banana pan cake
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice satay area with bbq prawns. Halal seafood shop food was ok
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The refurbished inside looks amazing. We had thai for dinner and it was great.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Wide selection of food found here but more expensive than the rest of the hawkers in the area. This one’s targeted for tourists.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The food is fine. Quite pricey. But great architecture.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Food here is nice (and pricey imo)! Some stalls can be pushy and try to hardsell but overall still a pleasant experience!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"You can feel the local culture in here, near MRT and can get the good price foods. You have many choice in here."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Wow. Stall 7&8 is so tasty! It is much easier to approach the kind man walking around in this stall’s shirt and have him take your order. This way you can get the food faster. You pay when the food arrives. They start taking orders at 6:45 but can’t serve until 7pm when the street shuts down. Such a sight to watch all the fires go up in grilling the skewers and such wonderful satay. You don’t need to order off true menu (shrimp/prawn is pricey)- I just ordered chicken, beef, and lamb separately."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Very wide selection of hawkers and probably the most beautiful food court in Singapore, but the prices are slightly higher. Perhaps because this is the downtown area."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,No frills but tasty. We had Szechuan from stall inside on the left as you come in from satay street. Mapo tofu and mala greens were so so good. A bargain at $15 for two people.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Alhambra satay king stall no 3/4 one of d best satay at telok ayer st...u dun live to regret it...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good...i like satay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great place to eat, lamb, Chicken, shrimp BBQ. Very reasonable price. The waitor could take order in four different languages."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"If you're seriously into good food, this is your Mecca! Anything you know and want about Singaporean cuisine is all here, especially their char grilled satays which is the main attraction."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Wide variety of food and drinks. Good place to hang out with family / friends.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Lovely food!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"A lot of birds flying around when I was having lunch with 2 friends, serve coffee with chipped cup."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"They have it all here. Vietnamese, Dim Sum, Korean, Indian, Japanese! Enjoy 🇸🇬"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Price is much higher . A glass of beet is 10sgd
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A really big food court. Lots of different kind of food. Price is ok. Not the cheapest, but not expensive. Must try thr satay skewer!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very cheap but really good food. Nice Asian atmosphere.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A historic place among the skyscrapper, which offers lots of local speacilities."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The food is cheap and tasty! It is a historical building inside the modern city!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place for Satay outside or inside for more hawker options.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice food place to visit at night, try the satay stall 7&8 they are the best. Try to sit nearby their stall."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Visited Singapore for a day on my way to US and luckily landed in this market during dinner time. Had close to ten mutton satays for $7,  a chicken mie goreng and a parotta curry and I will never forget that experience. There are bunch of satay places, I tried the one with the longest lines and boy it did not disappoint. Couldn't try most of the other stalls, but overall this place is a must visit."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Beautiful Victorian building holding a huge selection of hawker stands
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"As many stalls ""pre-cook"" their satay to serve the masses and hence not as fresh or crispy, a pro tip is to buy from the busiest stalls!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Wide range of local foods and you will be spoilt for choice. Do checkout the bread shop for fresh, home-made local waffles. One of the best waffles in Singapore"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great selection of inexpensive food. Busy and vibrant atmosphere all packed inside a gorgeous old Victorian building.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Wonderful food and atmosphere. Satay is a must, but there are also many other things too choose from."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place to eat
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Satay is to die for! Very authentic! Highly recommend stall no.6, power satay. Excellent customer service too"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good morning breakfast.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The best place to go for unique Singaporean cuisine. Difficult to fing a seat especially during lunch time.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Telok Ayer market had a wide range of food options including sea food, satay sticks,etc. It is definetely a good location to explore various cuisines."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great Unique open space to enjoy the Famous reasonably priced Satay👍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice night market with local BBQ
One of the Chechen wing bbq is very expensive so please ask the price before buying"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Pretty good selection of food, lots of different cuisines. Me and the wife went here because it was really close to our hotel (Westin), but it is also very accessible to people in the CBD/downtown area. Prices are very cheap (hawker price comparable) and the ambience is pretty good conpared to the other hawkers/kopitiam we visited. Lots of tourists eat here, i saw many when we were there. Families are also most welcome because it isn't as crowded as the other hawkers. Overall a great experience for me and the wife! Will come back to try the other stalls :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,At Singapore's Financial District & there are a variety of eateries at reasonable prices.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice indian food and others, during the week end"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"You can find lots of asian cuisines here. Indian, indonesian, hong kong, chinese, turkish and lots. I think the price is fair enough for tourists. On average it's ranged from 7-15 dollars. I like the atmosphere and it's clean."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Pure indian vegetarians 🌹🇮🇳🙏🇸🇬🚩
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Sadly many outlets have shuttered, possibly due to the downturn from the pandemic.."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The addition of Food Folks has made Lau Ba Saat even more kitschy than before. Food is still good though.
Most stalls are cash only, which perplexes me."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,One of Singapore oldest hawkers food. Offer a very wide variety of range of food. One of my favourite is the Hakka Thunder Tea Rice. Healthy and good. Generally the prices at Lau Pa Sat is fine except for seafood dishes at night. So if you are those who visit LPS at night please refrain from ordering those seafood dishes. If need be ask price before ordering. Lunch is terribly busy with spaces hard to find. Dinner some stalls are already closed. The later you go the less stalls available for choice.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,All sorts of vegan (deep fried) desserts!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"I had sate at lau pa sat stall at the extreme end
The beef was so tender and well marinated! The ambience with full moon was awesome. Maybe the club song choice was a bit too noisy hehe. Ok im an outdated mother.

A bit pricey for the seafood. But once in a while it's alright I guess."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,pretty hot inside if without the large fan... food so so and the atmosphere was not great on the night of visit
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great Indian, Costa Rican, Thai, local food (char kuay teo) and Satay! Try stall #8's satay."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Locally known as Lao Pa Sa. It is a big old structure that house many many food stalls. It open from morning till night. I love the beef noodle stall and also the Char Siew with Roast Pork noodle. Of course for those seafood lovers, there are stalls that cook sea food with various sauces and spices. It will be very hot in the afternoon as the whole place is only equipped with large ceiling fans."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"All countries foods in one place , this is the real multicuisine market"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Had Ice Kacang for dessert there. Quite big portion, a little too sweet in my opinion."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Hawker center close to CBD. On evenings after 7pm they close down the street for satay. Fun place to enjoy a beer while eating sticks of grilled satay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"The food is nice and very diverse. You can get Indonesian, Thai, Indian, Chinese food at a very cheap price. I felt a bit sick the day after but I think this was more the effect of strong spice."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Pretty good selection of food. A lot of noodle dishes/Indian dishes for some reason compared to other hawker centers or maybe it was just me. I dunno. Knock a star for the bathrooms...pretty filthy.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"You can find almost every kind of food you have to try in Singapore at Lau Pa Sat Food Court! If you are traveling in Singapore, trying food here will be a good option. There are Singaporean, Indian and also  Korean food and the quality of food is quite high so You won't regret!! And you can try Chilli crab and satays at a little cheaper price compared to the other restaurants.
Also while having food you can enjoy the city view of Singapore since this place is surrounded by large and unique buildings 😉
Don't forget that they take *CASH ONLY*!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"As an attraction, this place rates fairly well, as a dining opportunity, Lau Pa Sat falls somewhat short of the benchmark set by many of Singapore's hawker markets, like Newton Circus, East Coast, and Maxwell's in Chinatown, just a few blocks away.  There are some good outlets here, but the not so many outstanding ones.

Popular with the coaches of tourists that drop by daily, that may not be quite so fussy, one can eat well for as little as S$4 per head, or as much as $30 per head, so it's worth looking around and seeing what's available, before being hustled on to a table by one of the many hawkers keen to ply their trade.

Either head inside and order from one of the many stalls, or take a seat and choose from a menu, the beer aunties will take care of your drink orders separately, and evrything is paid for as it's brought to the table, pitchers of beer, under $20, is as cheap as you'll find on the island, but credit cards are not so popular, so bring your cash.

Extensively refurbished in 2014, it includes a variety of predictable cuisines, Chinese, Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Filipino are all catered for, with the odd western outlet for the homesick expat.  It also plays host to the Satay Market, in Boon Tat Street, the road down one side, which is blocked to traffic every single evening (from 7pm business days, 3pm weekends and hols), allowing the satay specialists to serve at the street tables, and is one of the few places in the business district that remains popular at the weekends."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice hawker place to try local Sg dishes. Satay and seafood dishes are great here. Good for late night drinks and place is clean.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Big variety of food. Quieter with less hard selling on weekend lunches :p
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Never had a bad experience here! Love the ambiance and location. Great variety of stalls.

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I love this place, my co-workers and I eat here every time we are in Singapore.

There is an excellent pork bun place for breakfast and for dinner the satay and chili crabs are delicious."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Great new renovation but still quite empty with the pandemic in progress. I would say most of the standard food stalls are just average. Come for the satay and chili crab.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I love this place. Some would feedback that it's very crowded and stuffy. Go earlier or later and choose a well ventilated table. There's good variety here. Personal favourite would be the roast duck, kwaychap and Indian food. Come after 7pm for the outdoor satay."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Lots of local delights at affordable prices. Try some zi char with favourites such as mee goreng, stingray, lala. And don't forget to grab the satay too"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very nice hawker centre building.... clean and good seatings....
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Authentic China Chinese beef noodles to die for.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Lots of food choices and decent pricing with amber space.
The Bento box I ordered was acceptable taste wise."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Super food options. I personally favour Mama Thai
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,It’s a famous hawker center within a Victorian style building.  The food was ok but very pricey.  Nice experience but I’d rather eat at the Food Republic in some of the malls in Orchard road  it’s so much more affordable and it’s air conditioned.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Nice place , near to offices and Friday evening is too lively to catch some drinks."

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great food. Stay is good. Halal zi char!

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,One additional minimart w lots of japanese snacks. Another corner a eatery of ice cream and desserts.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Cheap food , lot of varities but getting a place to sit is difficult in peak hours. One needs to place a tissue or their visiting card to book a seating."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good for evening dinner outdoors. A good mix of local food and the stores are still quite limited due to COVID but improving.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This a great place to enjoy local food, with bbq stick, Asian cuisine, beers... Night time is the best with a lot of people."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,great place to eat genuine singapore Hawker food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Excellent food at good prices
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place to try different foods from several cultures. Cheap and tasty.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Its an historic building in the downtown core area. Also known as Telok Ayer market. Over 100 years old, this old market was once a fish market which was converted into a food center. The building's unusual octagonal structure attracts lot of visitors. Variety of local food options available. Have a seating capacity of around 2.5k people. Very crowded during the lunch hours as this is the only place for people in nearby offices, with so many of food options in one place."

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Hasn't reopened to it's former full glory. Doubt they can before phase 3. CBD looks maybe 30% full. New tables not so bad.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Hawker centre with wide variety of food. A must visit food court who want to try Satay in the street. More of a street food concept and Indoor options are also available widely
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Satay there is still good! The tables are set nicely for safe distancing, altho this means that u might hv to wait awhile to get a table. But in the present situation, I like the safety features! Some stalls selling other types of food are closed due to the renovation going on inside the food court."

Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food selection and fast service. Like most food centers in Singapore, it’s very affordable. They close off Commerce Street in the evenings and earlier on weekends to serve outdoors. There are also a good number of fans to keep you cool even on the warmest days. Love this place!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"(also known as Lau Pa Sat)

Okay giving some tips and setting your expectations straight about eating outside for their famous satay and seafood festival.
At 7pm,  the road will close for the evening satay festival.. If you are near the area where the street will become outdoor restaurants,  please get ready to get hassled by sellers offering their menus constantly. Feel free to turn them down and say you will decide later. Be firm and frank with them.

Now eyeing on your chosen satay place, i recommend stall# 7&8, you must now position yourself around about the stall location either on or the opposite side. Do keep in mind that they have their own territories and they won't serve anyone who is not sitting in their area.  Each satay stall is paired with a seafood vendor, a drink vendor and also an Indian stall. Once you sit down, a representative from each will offer you their menus. Feel free to say no to anyone. It can get very busy so do pardon some who may be under a lot of heat working their hearts out. Just relax and enjoy the ride,  chuck out any expectations you might have about it.

Food wise:
~10 chicken & 10 beef satays were moist and pretty tasty (from stall 7&8) SGD$16 with 2 rice cakes
~grilled stingray & lala were very nice too SGD $25.

There were other indoor food vendors that are highly recommended (like thunder tea rice & ban mian to name a few) if you prefer to avoid the satay festival crowd. It is nonetheless something that one must do when visiting SG."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Fondly known as Lau Pa Sat by locals. A very nice place to chit chat, it also comes with good ventilation. But the touts are a nuisance and the food is mediocre. Price is higher than normal food courts. One hawker told me the rent is a killer."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice open market and food court in Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A great place in the evening if you have craving for Satay....
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Satay and BBQ
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Clean food hall with tons of options, asian and western. Loved the Laksa!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Other than east coast park that sells satay you can consider coming here to settle your satay crave
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,My favourite DonDon Noodles in Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,The satay very sweet..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Very expensive place to eat, the variety of the food is ok but the the prize is crazy high, like a tea set meal is around 4 dollars, that's too high."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Today the whether is very super hot and also is that fell sick
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"For Muslim, it has few choice due to high rent here. Seen many shops open n close. Today, found a new halal shop. This place is crowded during lunch time and not easy to get seats. However, it's good for architecture. There is also a tradition of having satay outdoor on a closed street at night beside this place."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,too many satae shop good taste
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A lot of people. A lot of satay stall. Don't have enough time to explore. Will update again after my next visit. Anyway who are new to Singapore, should visit here for dinner. Lunch hour a lot less stall open."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great selection of local food managed by kopitiam.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the very oldest hawker centres in Singapore and open 24 hours a day, so excellent for when you have midnight munchies that need to be satisfied.

There is a large range of food available here - chinese, malay, japanese, indian, and plenty of satay options on the street which is closed to traffic every evening at 7pm (I think?)

Pricing is quite similar to other hawker centres, though this place is certainly more commercial and very popular with tourists.

Late night food options are quite limited but being such a large centere there are still a good number of options available when most of the other stalls have closed.

Some of the best dim sum I have had is sold from a small stall near the middle by an old lady, and the fish ball soup from a local stand is also excellent. Worth a visit for sure!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great place to visit, lots of choice, definitely something for everyone!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good place for satay n b.b.q seafood..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Decent food, but those hustlers trying to push you to their stalls are very annoying."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A very fine casual multi cuisine and authentic Asian food dining place
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best satay in Singapore with idyllic outdoor seating and many other food options. Also very affordable. DELICOUS
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Satay taunting is still exists, its a tradition I think. Overall its still have the same old skool vibe"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Overpriced. Tourist trap
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Safe distancing place.....Best satay ever!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,This place used to be busting with activities day and night. A great choice of food from all the major races of Singapore. Right in the heart of the central business district.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"I finally got here on November 2018. It's within walking distance from the famous Merlion Park, only 800-900 meters away. The building itself is fascinating. There are many vendors, but there were not too many people when I was there on Sunday, November 18th 2018. I had a meal package for 4.8 SGD, 2 meats and 1 vegetables."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Not a great experience on a Friday night.  Harassed constantly with menus thrown at us at our table, even by the same guy approximately 12 times.  Satay was yummy from stall 5&6.  Beer options were poor with only Tiger on tap, and pricier than Newton too."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"good upper class hawker near the cbd. went here for lunch for a business friend reasonable prices, quick services and good Singaporean food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place and a lot varieties.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Authentic food, great atmosphere, feel the heat."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,variety of foods can find there
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Really good place to go for lunch now
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Sate best! Cheap also..... Gd for big qty members
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Heard a lot of about this food Centre. The number of food options here is mind boggling. Finally managed to try food from different food stands.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Awesome! This place has some much variety of food and it's all superb!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Amazing hawker centre with all Asian quisine you can possibly think of. Dishes under 6 dollars. Place is located within city centre. Great great great food! Tried Thai, Chinese, Indian. Go for tasting experience."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great intro to Singapore hawker culture and very central location. Take your first time visitors here then take them to more local places. The highlight for many is the busy satay street off the side of Lau pa sat
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"After a long day at work, just dropped by Lau Pasat and had a chillaxing dinner! Thanks to Delhi express for the yummy traditional soft fluffy naan and tender chicken tandoori which is so yummy! The price is very reasonable consider eating in central business district. Pls give it a try and you will go back for more !!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Few tourists. Wonderful food on the upper floor.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Not a bad place to find a wide varieties of local food. 👍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"loved the newly renovated lau pa sat. the interior's swanky and clearly more upmarket - probably to suit the location it is situated in and its (usual) crowd. however, i have noticed that compared to the lau pa sat in its pre-renovation/revamp days, the prices have hiked and are kinda overpriced for a 'food court'. also, there are q a number of vacant stalls presumably due to covid-19 and i believe i won't visit it as often as i used to due to the lack of variety.

hopefully as time passes by, the situation will improve and get better."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Lots of good food there but can be quite crowded during peak hours
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great place to get food in the downtown area. There's no AC in here but once you find a seat and sit down, you feel the breeze from the fans. There are so many stalls to choose from and some central stalls to get drinks. One thing different from other hawker centers is that there are people constantly waking around with menus asking you to order satay or seafood from. They won't bug you or continue to hassle you once you say a polite 'No, thank you' so that's always nice. Plenty of seats inside and on the patio. We came here several times and still didn't get to try all the stalls we wanted to."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Nice and historic architecture, with working bell tower. Food and drinks are not that good."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Not so big, but the mood is good."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A Best tourism place to enjoy your dinner here open air as well as indoor at Central Business District in Singapore and you can head to Marina Bay Sands walking distance before or after your dinner here.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Went after one week back. Most of the stalls were closed. Few outlets open ...food great...tried mala hot pot and thai curry rice. Great taste
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Must visit place to complete your culinary journey / experience in Singapore. The best street food in Singapore. The whole street is converted into a giant restaurant with the best satays served here. The aroma of the grilled food fills the air. Chilled tiger beer with Satay and chilli crab is unmistakably my most cherished memory of Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good satay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Beautiful place for street food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Cheap food for tourists + good quality!!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,best satay ~ best place ~
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A nice little piece of food heaven in Singapore. Getting a taxi can be a little tricky, since it is the area is super busy most of the times. The food choices are varied and would appeal of anyone's taste. I think this is a must visit when in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Really good satay! From satay stand 7 and 8.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Worth seeing the structure and trying cheaper local food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Did not get the best satay, but nice outdoor sitting, wun get smell on our clothing."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Wonderful claypot chicken rice
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place with good food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place to eat. Hope there are more stall.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Awesome satay and grilled prawns
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Quite busy during weekdays,  food is okay can't expect too much as per place and price. You can enjoy evening booz once road is closed and sitting area ext3nded outside on road."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Love this place for eating a large variety of local food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Excellent to sit outside in the financial district and enjoy the best sate in Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Packed on weekdays but pretty empty during the weekends. Good variety!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Well, decent but the environment is still very stuffy."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Plenty of food choices. Pleasant open dining experience. Loud bells announcing the hour is unique to this place.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"These food courts are always amazing. Very popular, the food is cheap and of good quality. In this one you can select Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean. I personally like Korean food very much 😎"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Omg.. stay away from the corner drink stall, order Teh C ice but they gave me my drink with the taste of coffee inside because they didnt wash the cup properly --.--"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I love this place. Spoilt for choice is an understatement, plenty of variety and cheap! To be honest you can't go wrong with any of the food courts in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Ok good try the satay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place to chill
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"If you working in city, near Tanjong pagar or raffles place, this is a great place to have lunch. There were many food stalls, but unfortunately now open around 20 stalls."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Never knew that Lao Pa Sat's standards is so awful now.

Song Kee Fishball Noodle: Yes SGD4 for a bowl of Bak Chor Mee is reasonable but what on earth did you get in your noodle? Huge bowl of noodle with pathetic amount of meat inside. Liver is so small (see attached picture) - as big as your 5 cent coin and only 3 tiny tiny pieces like it has been minced! 1 pc of sliced meat and probably half spoonful of minced pork meat because it's cheap stuff. The noodle is flat and bland. Just awful!!

(Shop next to Song Kee) : Char Kueh Teow is horrible - it's soaked with sugar!! So sweet and no wok hei. Drinking sweet sauce noodle is the way to describe it.

So what if it is cheap when the food is awful?? I don’t mind paying another dollar if they are willing to improve the quality."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"An old market, still relevantbto Singaporeans, with everything there, From satay to Ban Mian then desserts like ice kachang and ice cream and great beer at the a corner of the market"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good location for dinning with good price.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food, drinks and coffee.
Cheap meals and variety of asian food.
Check out the satay stalls in the evenings!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Real authentic satay outside with beer, what else"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I love it! I ate Thai Green curry. It was very very good. Wasn't too hot but although very hot. If you want to have quick food, Go there! You'll find everything you Like Here. The prices are also very nice."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Variety of local foods and Asian foods. You would love it's atmosphere as a historic building in the CBD. Avoid lunch time on weekdays as it will be very crowded with office workers.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food, with variety. A nice place to visit during the evenings / night to have dinner with a beer!

Ample seating available across multiple multi-cuisine stalls that this place has.

Comparatively inexpensive food.
This market walking distance away from the Telok Ayer MRT.

Behind the market is the Satay Street that comes to life in the evenings."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Large marketplace on the edge of Chinatown. Plenty of Asian cuisine: Indian, Thai, Korean, Chinese, etc. You can also find desserts and drinks."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Stall 6 is the best satay and SERVICE!!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice tourist attraction. Food is tasty but don't expect any fireworks. It's just a simple place to grab food. Poor toilet and sanitary facilities.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very good place to teast various foods...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"This food court use to be so lively...but now very few stalls...food is ok, not sure if night food stalls on the road.is on"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"What happened!? So many empty stalls, I hope this revamp hasn't pushed sellers out 😳"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Awesome spot that's worth a stop (coming from a tourist). So many stall options that you're bound to find something for everyone in a group and are able to try multiple stalls/dishes if you're in a smaller group. Great pricing and relative quality. 1 star off because the restroom was horrendous - no working stalls, etc. But otherwise, enjoyed the food and experience!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great tiger beer
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Not much stalls opened during daytime as compared to Amoy Food Centre. You would find a place to sit during lunch time as well.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I love this place love the food, sad to see so many places had to close due to COVID-19"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Too many choice of satay stalls but none bbq chicken wing stall. Alittle disappointed.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,The food here is very expensive compared to local hawker food standards. The outdoor hawkers can be pretty aggressive - as they push their menus to you as soon as you walk within their vicinity. Overall the food quality is ok but I can find better and cheaper food anywhere else in SG.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Great food options could improve on cleanliness
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Food is delicious but very expensive.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Variety of cuisines ranging from Thai, Indian, Korean, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia etc..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Many stalls still vacant, but nice food still prevails"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,I had see through dumpling and pineapple fried rice. Way too many options to not visit one more time.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,It's open at least 10 p.m.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Remarkable majestic grand clock.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Preferred place for dinner after a walk through boat quay
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good but stores are not all open.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place to bring your tourist friends.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Had breakfast here on a Public Holiday in the CBD area. Many stalls are open at 9am and there is a wide variety of food. Away from the crowds. One of the best place to have meals in the CBD area.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Casual dining place
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Tourist Must visit at least Once
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Some fantastic food, but satay sellers a little pushy."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The best hawker centre of the world!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"As military strongholds go, Fort Canning has had a long and varied life. Built in 1859, the fort was an essential site for Singapore's defense. Now in peacetime, the original building is home to modern performing arts troupes, and the park regularly sees picnics, concerts, theater performances, and festivals. Other attractions at the park include relics from Singapore's early history, from as far back as the 14th century, and Sir Stamford Raffles' personal bungalow. Guests can also see a replica of the spice market Raffles established in 1822, as well as the ASEAN sculptures that were erected in the 1980s."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best sate in Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Stalls are clean n orderly
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place to get variety of local hawker food. Clean and decent price with victorian style market. I had ban mian which was good!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Just interesting idea, traditional food center, in the middle of busy CBD area..and you need park in the surounding buildimg, which ia quite expensive ... or you might be find public carpark, which is seldom get the empty slot 😁"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A more spacious and airy food court in the area! Selection and quality of food are ok. There’re outdoor satay stalls for open air dining
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good place to bring foreigners for an authentic feel of local food. The prices are reasonable as well
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,You can find different vegetarian/ non-veg options to eat.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Funny place, when I was there I felt like in some kind of movie. Around me Skyscrapers, but I felt like in a poor city."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A really special gem in the CBD area.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Incredible food from local vendors at low prices
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Used to be a market place near beach of Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Many shops have closed down recently due to Covid i guess. Suggest take away as fewer tables are available during peak lunch hours.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"If you want to eat food late at night and stuff yourself with satay, this is the place to be. You can get more than 20 sticks for around 36 Singaporean dollars. There is also a lot of variety of food in the area. The satay places are open until very late unlike the other food stalls."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Yummy food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Old Market in the city, now a food court selling variety of affordable food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Not bad to have a change of operators like NTUC
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great supper plc. My very pricey. Tourist trap.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"For the love of food and ambience, The Old Market aka Lau Pa Sat need to be visited, especially for dinner, when you're around Singapore. With tons of food selection, mostly Asian Dish, your glutton side will be fulfilled with the deadly sin of gluttony.
Well, since it is at the heart of SG aka in the city area, so Lau Pa Sat's food and beverage is more on the pricey side for a foodcourt. The beer is overpriced, but yeah, it is beer right.
Don't miss the satay, any kind of it.
Becareful of birds and it's secretion, since Lau Pa Sat is an old building and tons of food there, so there are tons of birds too."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Gone are my favourite stalls after this takeover makeover by NTUC. Was really affordable and good.
Truly MISSED
- the char away teow stall with black and white carrot cake, oyster omelette, hokkien prawn mee
- song kee fishball mee
- dosa stall"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food! Online, it says ""open 24 hrs"", but not all stalls are. We went there for breakfast, around 8am, and there was only about 8 stalls open. But nonetheless, food and ambience was great! Would definitely come back to try that stall that has a Michelin rating! You guys check it out! :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Nice place
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,good! no other words! especilly shrimp good. I want to come again with my wife.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,the worst drink coffee shop at near satay selling place.. she sold my kids expired milo. went to change it . she said milo machine did this. and dont wanna refund/change to other drink. DONT EVER BUY DRİNK AT THE OUTSİDE-CORNER DRİNK STALL. ( in  middle in the photo)... satay was nice..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Wow!!! Ultimate street food. The satay is to die for.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great variety of food from all parts of Asia at good prices - especially for Singapore! Most dishes are between 4&10 dollars, depending on what you choose."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"So i heard this place from youtube, and they said that this place is a really good tourist spot. I was eager to try since now is the right time to try tourist spot. The place looks kinda unique (inside) with their old station concept (not so sure) but there was major renovation on going in the middle. The outdoor is supposed to be really crowded, but it was empty since it was raining.
Many stalls are closed, i'm not sure it's due to the minimum visitor due to covid or it's just like that. The vendors are really aggresive to make you order from their place, coming to you and give a menu to your face. It's kinda bothering me and makes me uncomfortable. They follow you, and keep asking if you wanna order something. Well, once is OK, but they can ask and leave and ask again for 3 to 4 times. It's really uncomfortable.
The satay is popular there (or so i heard). So i tried their satay. Well, it was good, but not special. It just taste like any other satay in singapore. The size is a bit smaller compared to the ones i buy in normal hawker. The lontong is really small while the texture is not so good. Price is same as other place.

Overall, the experience is kinda okay, but i won't come there again on my will."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Satay stret has great food and good crowd vibe.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice & delicious
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The best Satay stall 7&8
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Something old something  new. She is a grand old lady. She is full of memories to speak of. Whenever I go there to eat, I felt I have gone back in time. Now is our Kopitiam that is the future for all generations to come to her place to eat Hopefully she still stand tall for all our National Days to celebrate. 😁"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Halfway point to our 30km bike ride. Had kaya toast breaking before heading back to ECP.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Many food courts with a reasonable price.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Newly renovated .. love it
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Favorite food market in Singapore. Lots of Southeast Asian food. And Satay is the must!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,really amazing food for lunch and dinner
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Overly priced bad quality satay. Drinks stall closes before 10pm
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great food selection
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Wow awesome
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The satay street every day from 7pm onwards is best
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place for food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice to visit this place during lunch time on weekend to enjoy the location & architecture as it is not crowded. Draw back is that only 70% of the stalls are open.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"lots of food choices from around the world!
satay street at night!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Standard really dropped. Food pricing are really expensive but wasn't enjoyable at all. Not sure how this is a good place to bring your friends or tourist folks to dine. Coming from a local, better go somewhere else."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Decent mixed rice at a reasonable price for the CBD.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great variety of food over there, mostly because of delicacies like satay, chicken rice and a lot more"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good:

1 Decent place to find exotic food at reasonable prices.
2. Located right at the center of financial district.
3. Accessible from all parts of the city through MRT and bus.
4. Outdoor dining available after evening.
5. About 4 Indian food stalls here including two vegetarian.

Bad:
1. No AC.
2. Can get very crowded on weekends / late evening.
3. Dirty washrooms."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great place to eat a bit cheaper then the resturant. Great food. Especially mama citas burritos
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Exciting if you are those who can say no to touters trying to draw you to buy their ""special satay"". You will be spoiled for choices"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Ok more local foods
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best to visit in the afternoon...quite
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Better place for satay, no matter what they say in Crazy Rich Asians. Maybe poorer people come to Lau Pa Sat"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Splendid for supper n chillax ....
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Recommended. Seafood, satay, nasi goreng, and others. Good taste."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great food, great prices"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Cheap and delicious food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A must stay place for foreigners. And SATAY 😍😍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Fantastic food and atmosphere! Can reccomed everyone to come here for some great food!!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,best satay place in town. the road closes at night for the food stalls. eat at best satay 7&8!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Food is so so only.
Tourist area.
Come only for the experience but not for the food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good mix of local food at reasonable prices. If you are there for simple local fare avoid the food touts during evenings and weekends. If you are in the mood for a feast by all means communicate with the food touts on your craving. Good food goes with local beer. Stay is approx 0.70 per stick. Sambal chilli fish is a must if you are in a group.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great satay and ice-cold Tiger beer in the evenings, outdoor area. Hugely crowded but very friendly and enthusiastic stall-helpers to settle you in. Love the historic setting. Right next to the former Ogilvy Centre."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,You can get a lot of different food there. Most stalls are closed after 10pm but the outdoor stalls next to lau pa sat  are opened then and the street is closed. So 24/7 foodoptions. Just can't find a place like this in Europe. Except during the Football Worldcup. They just close the freaking street to build up a street food area in the middle of the city!!! 😆
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice food at great prices right in the middle of CBD
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great coffee & wonderful light dining overlooking one of Sydney's most private public beaches at Whale Beach. Try their handcrafted dark grain bread...  heavy, healthy & fresh with butter and Vegemite!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place to chill and great satay..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Visited just after Phase 2 opening. Very disappointed due to the store staff kept pestering you to order food from them. As this place is famous for tourist, they have tourist menu which cost more... So you won't eat in comfort. Order 2 Chinese noodles and came 1. The other one need to wait for 30 minutes. I was not sure why like that... So decided to cancel the 2nd dish. These store sellers need to change their attitude, service standard. I wouldn't even bring or recommend my oversea friends to eat here."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Stall 8 has the best satay and big red prawns
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"There is only 1 Indian stall at Lau Pa Sat selling naans, palak paneer and samosas."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Delicious❤️
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"now under renovation and only half in opetation.
looking forward for the full operation of LPS"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The market is 24 hours but most stalls will close around 10.30pm.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Crowded place , many food to choose from but nothing to special about the food.
Hawkers food taste. Satay place open very late. Now is clean better than before"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,If you don't know what to eat just visit here. So many type of food available 👍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Variety of food and drinks it's has the old touch.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very lively and spacious place. Plenty of food stalls to choose from. Ample of seating available. Affordable and delicious food!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Busy hawker centre, but lacks character"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good place to  enjoy.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"If you are tourist, must come! You can try all the local dishes here and the ambience here is great. If you are Malaysian, you’d feel this place is overrated."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great food but can get crowded during lunch time.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Wonderful food court at CBD. We have had noodles with grilled chicken and some fried dumplings, all very flavorful and nicely priced as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great foodcourt!!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"If I could give this place 10 stars out of 5, I would. This is hands down one of the best places I have ever been to - I am talking about the satay street at night. Try stalls 7&8, go for the satay mix and thank me later. The atmosphere & the food are spectacular and it really is something everyone should experience at least once in their lives."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"From Stall 5 & 6.
Nice, Tender & Delicious. I ❤️ Mutton Satay😋"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I love the no 14 satay shop
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Wow! What a wonderful place to eat street food surrounded by the skyscrapers of the financial district! Seated on a table you will receive the visit of a number of persons asking you what you want to eat, if you want a beer, if you want a napkin. They are ""waiters"" of the ""temporary stores"" that are around the square.
I was together with a ""citizen"" and this made everything simpler. If you can't be so lucky don't give up: just be sure to have some cash (no credit card there) to have a lot of desire to experiment something new and... Enjoy it!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Had a dinner with my daughter on Saturday night here. We arrived at around 7pm. It wasn't crowded at the time.
We tried the BBQ seafood stall.
The food was nice, especially the Singaporean cereal prawn! We also tried the snail (gomgom?) And bok choy as our chosen veggies.
Overall the ambience was nice, I dunno why at that time there was no crowd, lucky there wasn't any.
The price is ok for the portion they serve. The portion was meant for eating in-group, not individual, so mind your orders."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Satay, local favourite BBQ meat with peanut sauces plus many many local dishes..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I only visit the satay club after office hours..best of best in singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Not sure why is it call Telok Ayer Market. It was originally called Lau Pa Sat (Mandarin/Hokkien Language). The shape of the demise is octagonal in shape from a birds eye view. It houses one of the most sort after Tea Tarik(retired).

Original location can be traced all the way to 1822 which is a wet market."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Sunday and Public holidays also open to public
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"The place has indoor and outdoor dining areas and have a good ventilation. It consists of wide range of food, and people always recommended you to try Satay (stewed meat) when you are visiting lau pat sat. I tried the satay once, to be honest not too special and the sauce is just so-so for me. I personally feel the satay in chomp chomp food court is even much better. Well, perhaps everyone taste buds are different."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Lots of good food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Th food is delucious with a good price.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great place, Great Ambiance
Telok Ayer Market or Lau Pau Sat is a great place especially for evening dinner.
It gives great Ambiance with drinks and food.
You will get may variety of food. Famous for satay.
The road closes at 7.00pm for making space for table."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"So much fun! This is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. Made famous for their food - long before Crazy Rich Asians - this foodie haven is the best place to stop for satay row, traditional hawker center eats, and a Tiger beer or lime juice. Get a lime juice! Clean, well run, and conveniently located close to many area hotels. All within walking distance, but know the rules of the road (no jaywalking!)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Always packed, and the taste is good"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Not much of choice due to quite a number of store is closed?
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Best Cap Cuy!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Some shops were close. Just feel not good as before
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great experience
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Always a great place for some good food. Excellent variety of food, price is affordable and taste very homely!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A nostalgic place that has been face-lifted too much that it lost it original charm.  Plenty of stalls but most of them are slightly pricer than they should, probably to cover the high rental in town.  Don't forget at night where satay stalls and BBQ chicken wings/ seafood don the open street beside.  Go well with a couple bottles if beer."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,They have a great many options to choose from. Nice food that's reasonably priced too!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Also know as lau pa sat, tons of options for your belly."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,You can all kinds of Singapore food here
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,omfg
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Clean and the environment business Tower investment insurance.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place to hang out at night
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Really impressed by the variety of food here, just avoid lunch hours though - seats can be very hard to find."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good hawker centre
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Spacious, variety of foods, halal food stall available for muslims but mostly serves seafood bbq and satay."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,satay and shrimp meh...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Vibrant with endless food choices, what I had was delicious"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice atmosphere to eat and drink
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the many places I usually go to get my comfort food, taste very homely and prices are very cheap"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good & economical place to chill to watch people knock-off after work in CBD area
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Well, this marketplace is very live and noisy. So many different kind of food stalls are in. Great for local dishes! Always have a good time here."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very nice food court in the middle of Downtown Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Not enough cleanliess.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Perhaps best place to eat in business district of Singapore. You will find variety of cousin here...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A variety of choices to make sure there's something for everyone. I had the laksa, and it definitely hit the spot"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good location in CBD and spacious dining environment with choices of foods!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Many stalls are still not taken up.
Stalls are run by Kopitiam except for the satay stalls on the road.
Lots of empty seats inside."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"It's very geared towards tourists at night. But you can have good satay for less than$10 per head and feel the Singapore weather. Other Hawker centres may be cheaper and have a more authentic feel, but the location is convenient and much cheaper than surrounding restaurants."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Tourist and locals are here for late night satay.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I have always love this place for their satay and grill prawn. But the halal seafood stall were all closed. So if ure thinking of getting those seafood meals, please dont come. Cause they are under renovation.

But overall have always a go to place for a good satay amd prawn 😊"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I’m always miss this place.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Nice place ag night
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Not a good time to visit during covid-19 phase 2. Also half or so stalls are empty. Very and eerie place even during lunch time.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"More than half of the stalls are no longer around. Night 'market' stalls are still operating as usual if I am not mistaken. What's left as of today is la mian, Thai food, pepper lunch alike, qiu lian ban mian, chicken rice, local food delights (hokkien mee/carrot cake etc), Indian cuisine etc etc. So so much lesser options. Missed ayam penyet and Taiwanese Ru Rou Fan (braised meat rice)."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great place to find good food from many countries... Peruvian food was the only one missing.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The noodle is the better one this time
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place to be there
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Also known as Lao Pa Sat (pasar tua), famous for their Singapore's original cuisine. I expect this place to look like a traditional market, since experiencing food is also supported by the ambience. This place is no market at all, more like a modern food court. Some flock will love this place for being modern and clean while you can taste the original cuisine, but I favor eating satay in the street junction with a lil dirt in the tablel, so ya i was disappointed 😅"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Good Hawker-ish alternative, great variety of cuisines and nice airy venue. Seemingly open all hours too. We went early(11am), so wasn’t crowded. The dim sum joint was good, as was the juice bar, though my pick was the wonderfully titled Fishball Story, great balanced dish. See attached pics. Def worth a look on your Hawker trail. It looks like nighttime would be a lot better, with outside stalls etc"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Not sure if due to Covid.. but not all shops are open..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Lots of choices of foods
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Very cool market with eating spots. Unfortunately lots of vendors trying to hustle us for food which was annoying. Mostly b rated stalls . Food was good though and good juice options for cheap price 2-3$
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Fazlink satay. .go try their satay!. U come back for more!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place with good food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best sa te ever
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Ol'skool satay taste .... 🤤
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good variety of cuisines. The oldest hawker centre in Singapore. The busiest too! Open 24/7. Bathroom 🚻 🧼 available
Also, there's one Indian vegetarian stall which sells tiffins, rice items.
Overall it's a good experience here but hygiene can be improved!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Satay club is the best
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,One of the best hawker centers I’ve visited in Singapore. It’s got a vibrant vibe to the place. A lot of the joints in the place has amazing food. The staff does a good job of keeping the place clean.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Crowded.. Expensive compare to nearby hawker stalls
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Absolutely amazing hotel, the best mussels I’ve ever eaten really recommend those"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lively
Great food
Cheap"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"YES!  This is why I came to Singapore!  I was initially disappointed after wandering around the market three times and not finding any of the famous satay, until I realized there was an ENTIRE STREET of it out back! There's a reason Singapore is famous for these wonderful markets - try something new or something you know you love, and be sure to get some amazing satay."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Now, coz this pendemic covid 19,,the market not so active like before"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"A bit pricy comparing other hawker cemtre, but normally tasty."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Clean and looks nice. Not too many vendors hassling for business either
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Love this place.  Multiple option for food,  starting from Chinese , Italian, Indian and many more cuisines. Good place to visit and enjoy food."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A huge hawkers center with just the best food and really well priced. Sit outside and soak in the atmosphere and the smell of the Satays!! This in itself is an experience! A must is the veggie spring rolls that are made in front of you and of course the satay sticks. Loved it here!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great, affordable food! Service is very fast. Neat and tidy place. Wide selection of local food. Portion is generous. Would love to come back for more."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The famous food court of Singapore !! Totally worth the hype! I loved the food choices here and absolutely enjoyed my meal ! The prices are pocket friendly and the food is great! Highly recommend
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best filipino food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great place, great food. Slightly pricier than other hawker centers."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,best satay & grilled prawns in town
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Love 💕 this area
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"This place is for tourists,  not for local people because it quick expensive"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Food court where you can find almost every cuisine and still at reasonable price.

Currently many shops under renovation."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,So delicious
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great variety of food and has an indoor covered eating area. Pro tip: try the pepper crab and Satay. The street outside the market closes at 7pm with tables being added for outdoor dining.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Long time never been here, but look like a lot of stall is unoccupied. Maybe is due to Covid-19."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This was one of the biggest hawker places we found. The food was excellent, we didn't try all of them off course, but the ones we tried were really good. As usual we went for the ones with a lot of locals, and with that strategy you usually en vs upp with something really good.

Should I say something negative then it was that it was almost too big and as a consequence the sound volume was at times very loud.

But if you are in Singapore, don't miss it!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"One of the beautiful, historic and biggest food court in Singapore and certainly gives you a blend of many local foods. Affordable place for groups to hangout right till late night in central Singapore if you want to avoid the expensive pubs in Clarke quay. Must try Satay!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A little bit expensive then others food court in Singapore but it is fine with the unique design that can eating on the road! And the
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Had satay in the evening.  The ambience is great, alfresco dinning.  Satay average only."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place to enjoy food after late night run
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great location, large variety of food options. It gets very crowded during lunch and the prices are higher than other hawker centers."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very nice experience for satay and street food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,ok
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Based on 1 visit: The food is very good (particularly Satay in the evening). However, we were inundated by 'touts' trying to sell their food, and the signage for Satay street is non-existent. The food is more expensive than at other 'hawker' centers."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Compare to the other food halls, this one is definitely not the best. Expensive and the food taste was just not that good..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"I would like to warmly recommend the Le Fruit Juice stand #01-22 juice stall located on the first outer aisle. My family  had 4 delicious juices, all very distinct and a delicious milkshake. The uncle running the stall makes great fruit blend recommendations and even suggests changes based on fruit seasonality or your preferences. He made the juices with a big smile and his hospitality and service truly stands out."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Dining under the stars and food was delicious yet affordable...
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Affordable priced hawker food. Great variety of choices and were quite well prepared in my opinion. Recommended for both locals and tourists alike. :)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great selection of just about every kind of food you could want.  When the road is closed and hawker food stalls open, it becomes so called  "" Satay Street""... Great 😍"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A large open street food place that comes alive probably every day after 7 pm. A part of the street is blocked to arrange tables and chairs. One has the option to select a veriety of food including Indian, Chinese, Thai, local Singaporean,.....also one can chose inside the covered area or Outside on the street that is now converted into a seating area. The food is quite cheap and the place is crowded but everyone seems to be loving the atmosphere."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Thai food is excellent
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Great place for tourists.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,Over priced street food... And the hawkers are not honest... Especially the night hawkers selling satay... The first Malay store near the traffic light.... My satay cost me $14.... I have them $54....they pretend and did not return my change... I have to search which store took my order and they just sat and pretended until and chase after them.... Very dishonest.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"It's not bad, but I strongly recommend you walk a few more steps and go to the Chinatown hawker centre. It's much better, more local even though there are still a ton of tourists. Its big and there are plenty of choices. It's clean and well run, can get super hot."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,All dishes are of a higher prices than outside CBD area. Portion wise - smaller than stalls outside CBD too. Yummy rating? Same as other other CBD eateries.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best satay of Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"The day we were there looked like under expansion or construction.. not many shops were in business hours, some of them are even had no one in the shop to serve. I guess we were there at the wrong time."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,One of best places in Singapore to enjoy the famous Singapore Satay. Located in the heart of Singapore buzzing with the options of delicacies of multiple cuisines. One can find multiple options from local Singaporean menu. A place worth a visit for any tourist in Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,My favourite hawker center so far. It's festive and has a very wide selection of food. Many Japanese students come here after school
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Big hawker center with various food choice. Full of workers wants to eat at lunch time. Recommended place to find a food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Crowded and not much variety
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Okay good 👍
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,The food folk looks promising.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Night time..satay, bbq and chill with friends.. cyclist always eat here.."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good market for tasty and affordable food. Big portions, delicious food form different countries. My favourite market in Singapore :)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Good food on open space but must check weather forecast..
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Beautiful structure offering cheap food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Best place to try different cousins from all over the world at place and at an affordable price. Although i was more interested in Indian cousins one can find all types of Chinese, japanese mostly Asians cousins. Many places to serve you drinks and also a market on road which serves mostly fish barbecue items."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,My food was bland.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,"Midnight on a Saturday and many stalls were closed. Food and drink choices were limited. Friends ordered what was left, a dozen card board sticks of  satay, 6 salt infused chicken wings and 3 tiny pieces of chicken fried rice. I had to order water from 7-11 as the drink stall was eager to pack up and head home.

To be honest, I'm not sure why I was even there. Over hyped, poorly curated, terribly managed. Perhaps it's rocking, during the day. Stall food in the middle of the city is a great initiative too.

But it'll be a long time before I head back to Lao Pa Sat for supper."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"This food market has almost any kind of food you want. Looking for Indian tonight- there are about 5 places you can choose from. Needing to try out some typical Thai food, no problem. Wanting something a little more Western, just order some cheese burgers. There are so many little restaurants to chose from, it's hard to get through them all. And it's a complete one-stop shop as they have dessert places, drinks stalls, and more. We eat here almost every night due to the convenience of it's location and the great food that is served."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Really good, friendly place to eat. Be careful, some foods are not displayed very well so check before you eat."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Cozy, huge, Malaysia like hawker centre with many satay stall on open space."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Come and try the real taste of singapore. The variety of food choices is incredible, as well as the quality. A note for foreigners: if you see an empty table with a pack of tissue on, it means that the table is taken. Another good tip, queue where the locals queue, chances are the food will be outstanding."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best time Friday night :)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Having a breakfast at the busy street , enjoy my day off alone.."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Quaint old market in heart of financial district.  Excellent food.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,No car park. To park
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Place is crowded as you'd expect for a weekday lunch. Great place but could be a little clean. Overall a good place for a quick bite. I was told that the evenings are pretty fun with bars and street food. Haven't tried that yet.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,In the middle of the business district so a tad touristy but did enjoy decent satay here.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Al kinds of food delights
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Dining on the street more country's should do it
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The only thing missing is a good toilet.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"Good variety of food, most of places do not accept cards, only cash. No WiFi (when we were there) and bad toilet facilities. Works till late. I wouldn't recomend to order from some of the stoles as they were not very hygienic, but few are really good, so worth of try. Still I've enjoyed more food market on Beach Road, called Army Market, definitely worth of checking."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A lot of variety, cuisine from different cultures in a high-style vintage building food court setting.  Many stalls maintain food court prices as this places still serves mostly the business lunch and dinner crowd. But there's a live band some nights and one side of the building is satay street, with many stalls serving satay and beer on the street. Fun place."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,I hardly eat 猪杂汤 Pig Organ Soup for a long time. And I am surprised that I pay $4.80 (before discount) for lots of ingredients and it’s tasty too. Bring back my old memories back in the 1980s and 1990s.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Like the BBQ stingray, prawns ($2 a stick and de shelled) n satay! Go for stall 7."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Satay stall 8 mutton satay was good but chicken satay soso! We witness an Indian cleaner who was cleaning the table.  He was super honest. A tourist left a hand phone and he alerted the tourist. It comforting to see honesty here.  Generally service is good.  We also enjoy the Indian mutakak.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"This is a great hawker center. After 6pm all the grill outside preparing the satay. Inside, all type of food very good quality.
I love This place 👍"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Prata is pretty decent :) but expensive!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,damn empty these days... hoping the shops open up again soon
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,My 1st authentic chicken rice.  Lavhet! 💯🍽
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Renovated.  Clean. Bright.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Super crowded around lunch time which gives you a great experience. I had a delicious tea rice from the second floor and fresh juice
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"As much as I don't like to say it but LPS had lost its old charm. It used to be a place of nostalgia where you can catch up on old takes but now it's just a tourist stop over. The main crowd puller like the ""satay"" might cheer you up a bit, but it doesn't delight you..."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I like the satay here
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Cannot miss out on the Satay. The location in the middle of the skycrapers makes for a really interesting atmosphere.

Food is reasonably priced and at least on a Sunday evening there was plenty of space."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Good place with good food, best enjoyed with good friends (and good beer!)"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Right outside the Telok Ayer MRT station, you may explore different  Singapore food in this food market."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,You can try all different type of Singaporean food in the city centre. It was great to have dinner there and go for a night walk in the city.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good place, currently many stalls undergoing renovation."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Wide variety  of  tasty  food. The place is rustic
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Huge food court. Plenty of food options and cuisines from around the world. Very well located. Particularly impressed with the Victorian architecture of the food court.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The satay there is really good.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great place (kopitiam) to hang out with friends because there are plenty of local food options and many seats. Some people come for the satay, but i prefer other food. I would not recommend it for family with babies or tots though, coz there is no aircon."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A must stopover point for us whenever we are in downtown area. You get all kinds of cuisines under the same roof which are delicious as well as pocket friendly. The food courts in SG are usually economical and Lau Pa Sat, the oldest one, being at such a prime location is the favourite food joint for locals as well as tourists. Check out the road side Satay platter located behind the food court! Amazing food.. amazing ambience.. satisfied tummy!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,old building used as food court
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Very nice
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great market
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Lau Pa Sat is one of the oldest food courts in the city and despite how tall the buildings have risen around it, it remains a real staple of the food culture in the central business. if you want to try this for fun it's better on a weekend, if you go during the week at lunch time it is absolutely packed. the best way to try and reserve a table at rush hour is to leave a card or some sort of token to block the table so that you can go and get your food and have a place to come back and sit and eat it."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Varieties of foods and cuisines. Singaporean, Chinese, Indian, Filipino and other western menu."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,$80 for this lobster. For tourist only.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,A lot of different foreign and local food shops. Amazing experience.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,There are some renovation going on at the moment. Not many stalls open and the place was surprisingly quiet. Not sure if this is due to COVID 19.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Love the Satay's here... They have variety of chicken, lamb and Beef Satay.... 🍜🍢"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Awesome satay shop no 7&8 der khai... really tasty
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"If you are an Asian from Sri Lanka or India, you might not like the ""Sate"" cause it's grilled meat but sweet in taste"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,well...a nice place. but nothing really special
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Crowded food court. There were few stalls have long queues. I skipped these long queues and search for other stall. It turns out these stall taste good too. The price for the food in this food court is reasonable.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The best place for all the best street foods!
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,1,Not many shops and food not that good.  Looks like COVID19 has left many shops out of business.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,changing the atmosphere with new food stalls
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Great hawker center with an endless selection of stalls. You can find any kind of street food you want here for an extremely reasonable price. Good place to stop by for visitors to Singapore who want a hawker experience. The portions are generally not that big, so if you have a good appetite, go for 2 or 3 items!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Delicious indian food available here
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"It is a huge place with multiple cuisine options. It's like a food court mainly for office-goer who want to take a quick bite. During my visit at Singapore, I visited this place at least thrice for lunch. There are a few vegan counters if you are looking for vegetarian food. It also has a desert and juice counter. There are a few Indian counters also. Food is not expensive and the quantity is adequate. It's easy to get a place a sit even during peak lunch break. There is wash-basin at a the corner which is not very prominently seen."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The food is nice and various choices
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Affordable food in cbd
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,I felt this is Singapore
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Foods there are not cheap.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Good place to get local food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Good place to get solid local food. I feel there are better hawker centers for Indian food, however the range of options will not disappoint. There's also a large drinks vendor centrally located. Definitely an option to consider if you're traveling in a group, or family."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,A lot of food here. The cost is affordable enough. You can enjoy eating here while it is not the office lunch time 😅
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,So amazing please
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Amazingly local Hawker center, definitely one of the best. You'll be really spoilt for choice here. Look for the Tom yum soup if you can handle spice. It's amazing"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,The place to eat satay in Singapore and many more.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Good variety of food with decent vegetarian options and great opening hours. However rather touristic thus pricier than other food courts. All stalls I saw are rated A or B. There is another more local food court right down the street (be careful with opening hours)
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,"All locals will tell you its a tourist trap because there are stores that are a bit pricey for the quality. Trully, there are other best hawkerplace out there. This store gained its popularity due to its history, being the first market in SG."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Touristy place but Newton Hawker Centre is  better. This place has more Malay satay though and tasty.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Very nice food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"The foods and the hospitality....
A1"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Most well-known Singapore's hawker centre. Good ambiance, surronded by city & building lights.. ❤️"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,The food variance was ok. Great ambience and quite affordable.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Best hawker centre near downtown.... Must visit for different types of cuisines.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Lau Pa Sat

A place is mostly served tourist than local during the evening time, 90% tourist and 10% local.

The standard of the foods remain the standard, but the cost had been increased. Be more firmed when order foods if you are tourist, they tended to over sell and end up you will order too much of foods.

It’s still a good place for street foods in the evening."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Must go early, otherwise most seat are ""Choped"" during the office lunch hour !!!"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great choice of good food
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,3,Very crowded during lunch time. Long queues at almost every stall. Expensive because it is located in a very prime area. Food so so.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Plenty of great food opportunities. Clean, super friendly, no pressure eating out."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"A very pretty, historic food center right in the middle of downtown Singapore. There's a great variety of food. With so much activity it's easy to forget to look up, but you should. Both the inside and outside are really quite spectacular. The chimes give a nice touch as well."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Great variety of street foods and they even have the only Street Hawkers allowed in entire Singapore mostly selling satay. If u haven't been to south East Asia so much this may be a place to experience HOWEVER if u want real street Hawkers food suggest u go to Malaysia and Thailand where the variety and taste is so much more superior and real local food. If not, just enjoy this short 50m"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,"Satay super expensive. Avoid them, they are tourist trap."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,I really enjoy the variety of food and extra spaces and seats there. Especially love the drink stall that sells butterfly pea drinks !💕
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,An excellent hawker center with Victorian building structure. Used to be crowded at lunch hour.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Satay stall number 1/2 shiok..must try
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Lot of choices for food. Decently prices. Gets very crowded during lunch time.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Great place. Satay Street is a good place to get satay and cold Tiger beer.  Lots of variety.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Hard to get seats during lunch on weekdays! Plenty of good food. I tried their WaKee chicken rice and it was pretty good. Pricing is slightly higher ($5.50) but understandable. You can also use the kopitiam card there. Top up machines available as well
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,Nice place to have something for lunch.
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Skewers on the street! I had so much fun in here but some staff are annoying, they keep demanding people to order more food or buy some wet tissues :("
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Stall #70: TURKISH CUISINE: Falafel (Chickenpea) on plate + Lentil Soup 👍 👍 👍-23/9/17
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,2,Not much inside this hawker centre as majority of the stalls are being renovated. Go to Lao Pa Sat instead
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"Hawkers market with great selection of food. I ate at bbq fish at the entrance, enticed by the tiger prawns. The Hong Kong noodles and green beans were a great accompaniment and pit in stingray to try it. Interesting... not unpleasant. Recommend this for those wet days as there is plenty of seating under cover."
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,Amazing food court with numerous options for all tastes. Bit difficult to find a place to sit during peak lunch hours but still manageable as everyone is on the move. Prices are very reasonable for all the food items from various stalls
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,5,"Nice Singapore local BBQ, very affordable price in the downtown of Singapore"
Lau Pa Sat Singapore,4,"A wide variety of foods at a reasonable price, popular among locals and tourists, can be very crowded during lunch hour and challenging to get a seat."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Here you can explore the malay roots and culture in Singapore. Its a 2 level museum where in you will be instructed to start from the 2nd level down to level 1. Need to remove your shoes before you enter the exhibit area.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"first time here, visited the ""cat"" exhibition which is ending on 31 May.
super cute. u should visit before it ends."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Free if you're a citizen. Come here to experience what its like in the past. Its a great place to see whats life like back then and also to remember and appreciate the different cultures of Singapore. Great food nearby too; Arab Street.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Small and quaint museum set in a former Malay palace. You can learn and gain insight about the history and culture of the Malay people here. Staff were very sweet and friendly. I understand that there are guided tours here, which we didn't get to experience this time."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,A unique place of interest. Plenty of Malay heritage and history. I learnt a lot about Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca during the olden days. Worth visiting when you are around the popular Kampong Glam.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"The staff at this center was excellent. They were most friendly and helpful.
The exhibits were interesting and I enjoyed the old ""cinema"" showing snippets of past malay movies.
You are free to walk the ground and garden."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Visited the Malay Heritage centre which is located around the Kampong Glam area in Beach road. This Museum is also walking distance away from Sultan Mosque. Entry is free for Singaporeans and permanent resident. Admission charges applies for foreigner. Location is pretty accessible, walking distance from Bugis Mrt station.

This Museum is a good place if you are keen to learn more about the rich heritage and culture of Singapore’s Malay community. Due to covid 19 situation, some of the interactives and the kids’ corner are currently not available."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Went during the Cat Art event. Pretty cute.

Learnt quite a lot from the Heritage Centre main Museum."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This is the right place if you want to learn more about the Malay culture. The center is a palace which once was the house of the Sultan. It’s a great place to go if you happen to be in the area, it only takes 45-60min to see everything and it costs 8 SGD if you’re not a SG Citizen/PR. The hands-on interactions are suspended due to the pandemic."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,"Museum would interest an older muslim or peranakan crowd. Needs to bundle tickets together w other museums to gather interest. Aircon n lighting needs funding to upgrade, i imagine"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Amazing place to discover the Malay Heritage. I love the architecture here. Well maintain and staff here are passionate about this place. Recommended for local and tourist alike.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Interesting place. Covered wide areas of Malay Muslim culture.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",1,"Beware of a pesky tour guide.

My sis and I were there to take photos of the cat exhibition. A Caucasian lady wearing a ""Volunteer"" tag said she would be conducting a guided tour at 2pm that would last about an hour. Joining the tour meant having only 10 minutes to take photos. My sis politely declined. The tour guide offered to give a shorter tour if no one else signed up by 2pm. My sis again politely declined while I walked away.

While taking photos outside, the tour guide came near us. My sis politely told her we won't have time for the tour as we wanted to take photos of the cat exhibition. Her reply was ""No pressure. You came for the cats. You can be honest.""

We do not appreciate the insinuation we were dishonest when our intent was to be polite about declining the tour. Being pestered gave us the impression the tour guide had some incentive for conducting a tour. Seeing us take photos, she did not even offer to help us take a photo of my sis and I with the cats. It was a fellow local taking photos who actually volunteered to do so for us.

In Asia, it is common not to directly reject others. Not reading body language and not taking no for an answer graciously do not reflect well on her as someone ""volunteering"" in the hospitality sector."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Excellent place, great history, well presented.  Nice surrounding area too."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"If you are in the Kampong Glam area and ha e a few hours to spend/ or want to escape the heat, then this is the place to be. The Centre is very relaxed and has interesting information on the history of Malaysian in a Singapore. The staff were very friendly and did help to explain some of the exhibitions. Although the centre is worth a visit I think it could do more to welcome tourists and maybe to give visitors a free or cheap audio guide because some of the exhibits were a bit vague. There was a guided tour available at 1pm for English- but we missed it."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Free entry for us today. Eye opener for those of us who has shallow understanding of the Malay heritage. It is a short walking distance from the Majestic Sultan Mosque and Haji Lane.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,A very informative place on the Malay Culture. A short yet concise place to learn about the Malay Heritage. :))
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,A great place to learn about malays in Singapore. They did a good job in tracing back the history. A must visit place if you're interested in Malay Heritage History.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"This place provides a good understanding about the history of Singapore and how it came about to become Singapore. I particularly enjoyed the detailed description for each stage of development within the Malay region and the significant milestones. Taking time to read each description provided will greatly improve your understanding of certain areas in Singapore and appreciate the cultural significance of particular customs. I would recommend you book or attend a guided session as any questions you may have can be answered. However, I went alone and learned a lot from the information already provided."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Free entry for all Singaporeans and Singapore PR if you bring your IC/Student Pass. The building is small therefore don't expect to spend more than 1 and a half hours looking at the exhibition. Currently there is a special exhibition that is available at Hall 1 and 2.

Was told by the staff that the Heritage Centre would undergo a 2-3 years renovation in avout a year time. So I guess it's good to come how if you have yet to before they uplift the place."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"It's a beautiful house that once was the palace. The gardens are perfectly manicured but offer little shade. There is a small visitor center (free) and a museum inside, but for this you need to buy tickets and to enter, take off your shoes. A fountain in front is star-shaped."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,"Nothing exciting for me 😏
Nevertheless there's about the culture and history"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,The Heritage Centre is quaint and peaceful! The Sultans Mosque is such a charm! A must visit while in Singapore.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",2,A bit boring to me.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Enjoyed myself thoroughly here. The royal exhibits are especially beautiful, located on the upper level. It also tells of the olden days ethnic Malays who were here first way before Raffles came. But when going to the first level you feel that too much was focused on the entertainment industry. Lacking in contribution to successful Malays especially on academics, science and such."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Fantastic place to learn about the malaysian history with in Singapore and South East Asia over the last century and beyond.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,This was part of Changi Airport's free city tour itinerary. The place was so clean and just beautiful.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Visited two floors of exhibits, took us around 40 minutes to complete it. Interactive stations and children's play area closed. Museum shop in separate building."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Good museum to learn Malay history. The museum stuffs were nice. I didn’t know much about their history but I got more interested in it after visiting here. Plenty of chairs are provided inside.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Great place to visit to take great pictures but also to learn about the Malay Heritage in Singapore.

Regular events on site and the fact that it is beside the Sultan Mosque makes this place vibrant and worth a visit."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Informative center set in nice well kept grounds and nice herb garden. Chilled out place where you're able to escape the busy streets in the area. For those needing the toilet, there's a good public toilet with child changing area."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"I am truly amazed by this place. Very astonishing! I'm Javanese from Indonesia and I love to know about Malay culture in particular. Here I find the right place to know many things, especially about the development of Malay people and culture in Singapore. For you who are interested in cultural things, I would highly recommend you to visit this place. If you're foreign visitor, it would cost you SGD 6 for Adults (20% discount for group of 20 pax and above), SGD 18 for family of 5 (not exceeding 3 adults), or SGD 4 for Seniors (60 years old and above) Students1 (Free for children under 6 years old) Persons With Disabilities (PWD). I visit this place in the first day of February 2020.

In general, the Malay Heritage Centre is housed in the former Istana Kampong Gelam, a palace which was gazetted as a National Monument of Singapore in 2015. The centre showcases the history, culture and contributions of the Malay community within the context of Singapore’s history and multi-cultural society.

Officially opened in June 2005, the Malay Heritage Centre provides wonderful cultural exposure and learning opportunities for visitors of all ages and interests. Situated amidst the Istana Kampong Gelam, Gedung Kuning and the surrounding Kampong Gelam precinct, the Centre acts as a vital heritage institution for the Malay community in Singapore.

The first Istana Kampong Gelam was a traditional timber structure built on stilts, and in honour of the Istana’s original layout, visitors will commence their tour of the permanent galleries from the upper level and end their visit on the ground level. In the traditional layout, the upper level is called the panggung, which serves as the main living and sleeping quarters of the house, while the kolong at the ground level is typically used as storage, work or service areas, and even as a children’s play area.

I wish I can get back here next time! :)"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Wonderful place. Came here during the annual Malay cultural festival and the grounds were so energetic. The centre itself is superbly preserved and maintained
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"I learnt so much about the Malay culture and that its so good to know about the roots of singapore with all the exhibitions displayed. This place is so iconic and historical. Also, I recommend for visitors to remove your shoes before entering and wear socks if you do not want your feet to be left with nasty black stains. But overall, I love the aesthetics of this place and how regal the place looks."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Tranquility place in centre of Little India. Nice park with relaxing pagoda, small botanical garden with herbs, fontain in the centre, cozy souvenir shop, visitor's centre. If you want to know more about history, you should visit."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Interesting history, including Singapore’s first president."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Awesome place.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,"A small place. Once should be able to complete the visit in 30-45min. Highly suggest one to spend a little more time outside the centre to see more of Malay culture. Other than the Mosque, there are a lot of restaurants."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Its great to bring preschoolers here to learn about the Malay Artifact to relate to the Malay Cultural Learning.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"The location is a little bit secluded, but quite easy to reach by bus or MRT. It is near the Masjid Sultan, which is clearly visible from a distance. The museum itself has 2 floors with many interesting item, but I would like to recommend the free guided tours, which runs from 11 am for about 1 hour. The tour guide is very professional and thorough, with clear English and enthusiastic manner. There is a museum shop and some additional exhibition area, which is quite interesting. Recommended for people that has interest in Malay and Moslem tradition."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Nice place to visit. Must come
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"It's clean and well preserved. The overall design is retained however the palace grounds is improved with modern landscape. The contents of the museum is so insufficient to reflect the true Malay culture. The kampung spirit and the simple lifestyle of the Malays.
Not much history about the inhabitants of the palace. I know as my great grandmother was an inhabitant there. Direct descendent of Sultan Hussein."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Good glimpse into the past history of Singapore after Raffles landed. Worth a visit and also surrounding areas with rich Malay culture and nice food
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Right place to know Singapore history. It is decent and clean llace. Lots of halal food stores here as well, good thing for Moslem traveler"

Lots of space to stroll and relax.

Clean public facilities available. Just steps away from the main Mosque."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Good for tourists to learn about the culture, however it is not so much of a place for beautiful murals and sceneries. The garden is clean and organized, however not enough for you to be in awe. If looking for murals, just walk around in the alley(s) nearby."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Wonderful place for get together. Famous Victoria street and Sultan Mosque just opposite of this heritage centre.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Very interesting Malay heritage centre.

"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Awesome! I love the cat displays. Also all the greeneries around!

"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"This place is adjustent to sultan masjid,  Beautifully maintained and history well preserved, about Malay culture, hajj journey etc.... Must visit"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,I just feel that what the centre lacks in is probably daily traditional performances for tourists like that of Bali.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Great place to learn about the history of Malay , went for the Bugis exhibition which is full of historical, great displays .Do visit .."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"It was an incredible place to learn more about the history of the Malays during the early days as you could explore around and observe artifacts and read descriptions. There even was a part where u could chill out and relax on a chair and watch the history of the Malays displayed on a projector across the wall. It was also a comfortable place to be in as it is generally clean and has air-conditioning. Furthermore, it even lets you have a first hand experience on the Malay Games kids used to play in the past(e.g. chapteh, five stones) and also how to wear a traditional sarong. I highly recommend this place if you are keen about learning about Singapore's past, or even as a tourist!"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Interesting things there
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,A good place to learn interesting facts and culture about Malays

"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Very interesting and very well organized
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Interesting museum to know more about the Malay community in Singapore!
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",1,"Pretty unfriendly place. The minute me and my son got here, on a Tuesday evening at 5:10 - ostensibly 50 mins before closing- I was asked/told:
1. What I was doing there?
2. If I was singaporean
3. I have 15 mins

There was not a single visitor. I entered from the museum store but upon every was told that the store was closed.
The exhibits were really nice and engaging for little kids and i really learnt something new. There isn't a lot of info about Malay culture in Singapore and it was pretty eye opening. But the terse, unwelcoming attitude of the staff there really put me off."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Situated in Singapore's heritage district of Kampong Glam and right next to the Sultan Mosque, the Malay Heritage Centre provides excellent cultural insights into the Malay community in Singapore. The visit starts at the upper level, followed by the lower level and two external outhouses, housing permanent galleries. They showcase stories and artifacts from both Singapore's national collection as well as contributions from the local community. It is a reflection of Kampong Glam's historical significance as well as the contribution of the local Malay society. The structure was once of traditional timber built on stilts, which has been thoroughly renovated over time. It is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00am to 6:00pm, with free admission for all Singaporeans & Permanent Residents. A couple of hours can be easily spent here."

"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Loved it. Great service. Nice exhibits. I was wondering though about so much focus on entertainment contributions. What about in other fields?  Academia,  science,  tech,  medicine. I might be wrong but I thought this was a bit better covered in the other heritage centres."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Nice grounds, interesting museum & surrounding area"
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Nice Museum about the Malay History in Singapore and not only about the modern development everyone knows. The Museum goes much further back then the British time and shows about the history of the whole region. But the actual British time to the modern is missing a bit in my opinion. Nonetheless a good museum to visit if you are interested about all of the history of Singapore.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"A small Gallery on the origins of Singapore and Malay culture. With several artefacts from the 14th century to the 20th century. Due to Covid-19, all the interactive exhibitions are off-limits (i.e. unable to touch them) but worth a visit if you are in the area!

PS. Free entry for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents! (please bring along ur NRIC)"

The Kampung Gelam & Arab Street area has numerous iconic places of interest such as Masjid Sultan, the Kampung Gelam Malay Heritage Centre, Al-Sagoff Arab School and a lot of historically quaint shophouses. In addition, if you're staying at any of the hotels around here, you may take a walk to the nearby business areas where you can find Raffles Hospital, the majestic Parkview Square office building, popular shopping complexes and a couple more historic mosques (other than Masjid Sultan)."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Very calm
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"A beautifully restored old palace with history and culture of the Malay people. Short vintage movie clips (with subtitles) are fun to watch.

Not only experience using your eyes. But also your nose, your ears and skin. They give you everything."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Amazing how Singapore Government maintain this heritage.
Very tidy and clean and provide excellent information."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,My children appreciated how difficult travelling by ship was for people who wanted to go Mecca for their pilgrimage. The artefacts caught their attention too as they think about how it is made and used.
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Its a place you can learn about Malay heritage, language, arts and history."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,wow it's a nice place

I used to live in Kg Glm.
Love the ambience. The foods great nd shoppings nice."
"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"Closed on Mondays. Confusing setup. There are three galleries. Two of them are free but the main gallery requires payment/tickets. Although I arrived before 5:30pm, the security guard refused to let me in because the ticket seller at the Visitors’ Centre was closed. The 5 stars is for the two galleries I viewed relating to the Hajj. (January 2019)"

Do wear cool clothes and comfortable walking shoes as you would most probably be walking the area around the building too - and THAT for me is the highlight of the visit.

I liked how the Malay culture and way of living sprang out organically surrounding the Malay Heritage Centre. You can see how the residents (both Malay and non-Malays) co-existing in a sort of complementary ways. This is a quintessential Singaporean experience that must not be missed. You would be hard pressed to find this experience anywhere else !

"Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"(Translated by Google) This palace is located in the Sultan Mosque area, Glam village. We can enter this building because there is a museum in it. There are two museums. One paid museum. While on the right side page there is another museum that is free. The free museum shows collections related to Singapore's history in Muslim Hajj activities around the country. Oh yes the palace is surrounded by halal restaurants. Many Padang restaurants are also nearby. In front of the mosque there is a garden that is not maintained. There is a very large wooden swing, the size is around 2.5m x 1.8m, but unfortunately it looks fragile. Maybe it used to be a photo spot for Instagram, perhaps. There is also a white iron swing nearby. It would be interesting if repaired again. Oh yes in the yard of Malay Heritage there is a medicinal plant garden but it is less interesting because the garden jam is also small, some plants are damaged and some plants lose their clues.

Banyak restoran Padang juga di sekitarnya. Di depan mesjid terdapat taman yang tidak terawat. Ada ayunan kayu yang sangat besar l, ukurannya sekitar 2,5m x 1,8m, tapi sayang sudah tampak rapuh. Mungkin dulunya sempat dijadikan spot foto buat instagram, barangkali. Ada juga ayunan besi berwarna putih di dekatnya.  Akan menarik kalo diperbaiki lagi. Oh ya di halaman Malay Heritage terdapat kebun tanaman obat tapi kurang menarik karena selai  kebunnya kecil juga beberapa tanaman rusak dan beberapa tanaman kehilangan petunjuk nama tanamannya."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Road work. Road diversion. Carpark
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,1,"Money matters! I do not understand why they want foreigners want to pay such amount of money. To know peranakans, should foreigners should pay a lot? I don't think so. Look England! Their splendid museums and galleries are opened to the public for free all year round. Paris has museum pass system that foreigners relieve their paying for visiting sightseeing."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Awesome place to visit. Even the building having been a school in the past is worth seeing.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Great museum!!! A bit more personal than your average museum visit. We did the tour with a volunteer guide and had plenty of luck with him. He had many great personal and family stories to tell and even some of the items on display were on loan from them. There are also temporary exhibitions, for us they most definitely were worth our time. In all a great 3 hours of quality time. I recommend visiting it during lunch so you avoid the strong mid afternoon Singapore sun."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Better have more translations in other language!
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"Due to the renovation and restoration work in this area, it is now a close road. Also the museum is now close for major revamp."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Fascinating museum with artifacts and art from the Perenakan culture.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A most interesting museum. Displays and exhibits are well captioned and the narratives are well thought through. The history of the Peranakan communities is a fascinating one and brought to life here. I'm not Chinese but European, but I still found it fascinating. Highly recommended."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Thanks for the good
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,The museum is closed until 2021.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,Nice guided tour
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Went on a Sunday and took advantage of the 1pm free family entrance. They were having an exhibition on Peranakan photography which was great.
A good hour or so spent. Try the Baba house too to put it all in context."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Good view.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"Peranakan Museum is about to close at the end of March for an overhaul and it's about time.  Its exhibits are tiring and lacking fizz.  Same exhibition day in and out over so many years. Same cautious security guards who are intent to ensure that you don't stray out of line, lest the exhibits come to life.  Hope the new museum will be more dynamic, featuring different dynamics at various points."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"This place is an underrated gem in Singapore! I love how the Peranakan culture is not just limited to Singapore - apparently the Philippines has Peranakan roots, too! I saw how similar the cultures were, from the furniture to the wedding culture, and even the ways in which the women run the household!"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"The Singapore Peranakan Museum is very interesting, if you want to learn about the local polyglot culture. There currently is a display of local antique household furniture, some of which is exquisite.

The museum is more suited to adults, probably would not hold the attention of children."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A really nice and enjoyable museum about Peranakan (Straits Settlers of Chinese origin)  culture and traditional way of life. All the clothes, furniture etc were really interesting and the signs helped me understand the significance of each artefact. The museum will probably take about a couple of hours if you want to see everything."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Local Singaporean get free entry! Start from level 1 then subsequently visit the exhibits from top floor and work your way down. It would be great if you can get someone knowledgeable to explain, because you're gonna be overloaded with information."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"What a great hidden gem! The museum is very informative about a culture that is so important to Malaysia. They have an amazing collection of porcelain wares. We also really enjoyed learning about the Peranakan 12 day (!!) weddings! They also talk about different significant lifetime events. While somewhat small, it packs a lot in there! Highly recommend!"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A nice place to learn about Peranakan history. The place is so interactive, they provide you a sheet of paper to be completed with stamps that you'd find along the museum. However when I went here, some of the stamp machines are broken. Nevertheless, this museum provides you a complete lifestyle (and even lifecycle since there is a death section) of Peranakan."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Nice place for family
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Before I began my tour, I was given a circular card that I was supposed to take along with me. My challenge was to find the ""family treasure stations"", all located in different galleries. Each station represented a different item that's important to the Peranakans."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"So interesting, fascinating informative displays with wonderful decorative arts exhibits. I spent hours here last time I was in Singapore and I will go back again next time I visit. A beautiful building as well. The museum shop was full of tempting wonderful delights and I had to reluctantly limit myself to two small pieces of peranakan carved china. But if you can save up, do so and go wild. Lovely stuff."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Good informative place. Great place to know the history of Singapore and the various cultures it blends. The sections are very informative and the overall maintenance is up to date.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Glad to visit the exhibits before it close for a makeover
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A local recommended I visit this museum, and I am happy he did!  A beautiful museum and learning of the Peranakan people. Also check out the gift shops. The ladies who run the two shops are Peranakan and have wonderful stories and history to share and beautiful bead work to sell. Well worth the stop."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A great place to learn about the Peranakan culture. Whether you're a Peranakan, or a foreigner; there's a great deal to learn at the museum.  Take the guided tour, as the guides' are extremely well versed and knowledgeable."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Fantastic museum full of so much information and history. I really enjoyed learning about their culture and customs. There are about 3 levels showing life, history, needlework, home life, marriage and death. There are interactive sections for kids including craft. For $10 it is excellent value. It is easy to get to via public transport. They have clean bathroom facilities as well. Air conditioning gets a bit cold so bring a jumper."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Looks small on the outside, but the museum is actually pretty big! I loved the ""Family treasures"" activity, where you are encouraged to collect stamps from various exhibits."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Individual ticketing at $10/pax. Singapore citizens, Permanent Residents, and children aged 6 years old and below enjoy free entry.

The building housing this exhibition was a school. Learn about the unique Peranakan culture and habits developed from descendants of local Malay ladies and foreign Chinese merchants centuries ago.

Guided tours (in English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and French) are also available. Check their official website for detailed timing available before visiting. Voluntary donations to upkeep and preserve the museum is also available on the spot."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,1,"The direction for this museum doesn't seem clear. They need to be clearer about who are the ""Peranakan"" and what makes a Singaporean a ""Peranakan"". Younger generations and foreigners are presented with delusive narrative of a special group of citizen with unique genetic makeup and cultural identity."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,This place is the perfect place to know more about the history and origin of Peranakan in Singapore. It has good static display with clear description. A section of the museum was under maintenance when I was there.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,It was really interesting to learn about the Peranakan culture in Singapore and it's history. The museum has a huge collection of old photographs and interactive components for learning more about cameras. The staff is super helpful and caring about your feedback.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Being Peranakan my review might be abit biased but this is one of the more interesting museums in Singapore. History of the Peranakan culture and the influence in modern times is displayed prominently and explained thoroughly throughout. Great place for history buffs to brush up on their Peranakan knowledge.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,This museum is one of its kind in Singapore and probably in the world. A small museum it is but no small content when it involves Peranakan culture.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Museum with modern facility.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,The entrance fee is $10 for foreign visitors. I would recommend strongly to join a guided tour since the docent is also a peranakan and has a unique stories not contained in the displays. The docent really helped make the history alive.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,My second visit so far and I have discovered more information than I know about the Peranakan Heritage. Love everything about it.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Make sure to go on one of the free guided tours. The guide is amazing!
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,This is my favorite museum in Singapore. It's all about the Peranakan culture and traditional daily life of native Singaporeans. The museum has multiple levels and there's a lot to discover. It's highly recommended to have a guide and it's totally worth the price. Our guide was a seasoned lady with an unparalleled humor!
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Good place to visit if you want to know more about unique Chinese customs because of inter marriage.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"It's a small museum (and they said they were going to renovate this place sometime soon when I visited on Januari '18?). I suggest taking the guided tour so you can get the best value of your visit to this small but lovely place, especially if you're from countries near Singapore. It's nice to know how Southeast Asian culture blends and resulted in what people nowadays call ""Peranakan culture"""
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Very educational with many well preserved exhibits. You would appreciate the amount of effort done by the curators to document intricate details of Peranakan tradition.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Love the garden there, Cant wait for it to open!"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,Not very impressive but the best place to learn Peranakan culture. The museum lies by a small road near SMU. It is a quiet place. They provides some small games for visitors to enjoy more.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Old ancient building heritage
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,The best museum in town with the National Gallery. A pure piece of Singapour history is in this museum. Highly recommend the guided tours.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Traditional Wedding exhibition, Nyonya needlework and glass beadwork were astonishing. Noted on my wonder-tips site."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Learnt more about peranakan culture and their history. There was an open house on the day i went which had many activities for people to try out. Its not as popular as other museum. This museum also kept the historical look of older buildings which looks very appealing and yet relaxing at the time. I am a person which has interest in architecture. Really amazes me that the museum is still looking very new
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,The permanent collection gives you a great sense of the splendor and traditions of (wealthy) Peranakan culture. The exhibition about needlework was exquisite - they had remarkable examples of beadwork and embroidery! And right next door is the substation which has great murals covering its exterior walls! Walk to the back of the building to check them all out.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Located in a historic building. You can learn more about Peranakan (mixed between Chinese and Malay) , e.g. people, lifestyle, cloths, utensils,  handicrafts, etc."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,1st time there.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Really authentic and so beautiful. The restaurant true blue that's attached to it has the best food in Singapore yum yum
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"This museum is specifically about Chinese Peranakan culture. The definition of Peranakan encompasses all marriages between foreign traders and local women, yet there is little attempt to include other kinds of Peranakan in the picture. If you respect women's rights at all, prepare to be enraged by the historical facts documented in this museum. As museums go, this one was just alright. The paper embossing stamps were the highlight of the visit."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,One of the Best museum in Singapore to visit.. on 2nd floor there is a table cloth 2x2meter made with thousands and thousands of glass bead...
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,A great presentation in an orderly manner that captures the cultural diversity of Singapore. A must visit place.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Excellent local guide learned so much about the history and culture...bought in the shop and ate at the recommended Peranakan restaurante a couple of doors away
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"This museum is a quaint, hidden away gem in the heart of the city. It has detailed exhibits that reflect positively on the Peranakan culture and heritage that does well to educate and preserve the knowledge and spirit. The museum itself doesn’t have much foot traffic because of its location, and many visitors are backpackers as well as students (students in school groups). The place is air conditioned and they have audio visual materials to supplement the exhibits. I don’t believe that guided tours were made available when I visited, but most of the information and guides were self explanatory. Some corners of the museum, especially on the upper floors are dimly lit, and there can be an eerie presence (chills!). I would advise to visit the museum in pairs or groups. Nothing bad happened to me by the way."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"Highly recommended of you're from a peranakan background. Lots of details and photos about peranakan community settling in Malaya/Singapore. That being said, I'm not peranakan and didn't find it very interesting for me (personal opinion). entrance fee is $5."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Is a great place to learn more about the unique peranakan culture in Singapore. However, there are some information in the gallery which is so clustered together at one place I feel so giddy lookibg through everything..."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A nicely executed and interesting museum to celebrate local Peranakan culture, history, and art."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"I think paying for this museum is worth it. It tells you a lot about the Singapore Heritage. Get a dosent if you can. The Peranankan culture is an old heritage that is the root of Singapore. It is a rich culture that is shown in the clothes, houses, cockery and jewelry."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,One of the best museums in Singapore. Learn all about the Peranakans here. The gift shop has nice trinkets.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Good place to learn about peranakan's origin.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,Under renovation as of 22Nov2020
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"I found it mildly interesting but contrived - 'we have Chinese immigrants so here is some Chinese stuff; we have Indian immigrants too so here is some Indian stuff'. Its not expensive, and worth every penny."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,"Very cool history museum, although it's small it is very specific"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,4,Beautiful piece of architecture. Great museum to find out more about the lives of the Peranakan people.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Peranakan museum is a historical museum dedicated to various ""peranakan"" (people not born on China but in other countries and thus already adapted with those countries) tribes and how they lived a long time ago. There are various pictures that demonstrate as well as figures to display their ancient lifestyles and clothings as well as how they ate and paid respects in the funeral. It is a sister museum to the Asian Civilisations Museum. The museum officially opened on April 25, 2008, with ten permanent galleries showcasing main themes of Peranakan life. A central feature of the museum is the Peranakan Wedding Bed which once belonged to Mrs. Quah Hong Chiam of Penang, and the very bed where she gave birth to the first seven of her 11 children."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Very unusual but good food. Worth a try.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"A really great blast in the past that gives a lot of insight to the history of singapore as we know now.
They allow you to touch a lot of the items which is nice and refreshing compared to a lot of other museums.
Plus side free entry for locals and PRs! 😁"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Nice but museum shop could be bigger with more affordable souvenirs, and some exhibits could be enhanced with more depth (stories on challenges of being peranakan, exhibits of recipes (perhaps the occasional live samples, etc), and better use of interactive AV perhaps even AR. Some issues with lighting that made many exhibits hard to view because of the way light was reflected/refracted, e.g. some paintings could only be viewed from an angle. Lovely building."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,2,Alot of nice peranakan jewelry. But did not like the restoration done on the furniture. Looks thick n all the furniture lost their character. No scratches or bumps left. All that is left is varnish n paint
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Very good expat volunteer guide who was not Singaporean or peranakan but was very informative and took her time to chat and recommend Baba House which we were not aware of but will be a future destination.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,Great place.  Additonal star when there is enough parking lots
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"As a Chinese who is living in China and planning to immigrate, this museum makes me think a lot. The changing of culture, the identification, and what they suffered. It might be a little confused to the visitor who does not understand traditional Chinese culture, but it is really meaningful for me."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Excellent place to learn more about the Peranankan culture. There are 3 stories to the museum, organised by themes. The artefacts were beautiful! It would be good to join the free guided tour (see website for details) when you visit the museum. The docents are knowledgeable, friendly and they can help you 'connect' with the past... it's almost as if you were in the nonyas' shoes.
Visit soon as the museum would close for 2 years for renovation."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"S'pore heritage month - Peranakan Museum open to foreigners for free on 3/16 and 3/17.  Normal day tickets are available for $13 adults and $9 for students, Singaporeans free. It's kind of pricey given the limited display of the artifacts and most of them are kept in a distance or in a glass cabinets display, for your eyes only 😅 I went to the Peranakan in penang which is better.
Due to the heritage month, they gave away goodie bag to early bird visitors, which is really a great idea to get to the art of Peranakan. There are cards, coloring books, notebook and color pencil which are the Peranakan art pieces. Thanks.
There were stree parties which were nice with the authentic dancing, songs, merchandise and foods. But it's quite expensive, a tiny small, half filled container with nyonya laksa $5, finished in 5 mins"
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,Excellent hidden gem. Worth visiting.
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Peranakan has similar culture as Vietnamese Chinese, and Vietnamese. The most impression is the embroid cloths, decorations.... They are
unique."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"I'm a peranakan and what I've known about my unique culture was passed by word of mouth and daily living. A visit to this museum is an eye opener in many ways. What knowledge I had was increased by the information and exhibits at this museum. As this is a public museum, the artifacts on display was an accurate depiction of peranakan life from many regions in Southeast Asia."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Loved it. Beautiful museum with lots of authentic relic from Singapore's history of the Peranakan Chinese ethnic. Includes several family altars, authentic funeral carriage, nyonyaware and dining sets. The Amek Gambar temporary exhibition that was on show when I visited was also worth the S$13 admission."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"Beautiful heritage building has been renovated for museum. The history of peranakan cleary described from cultural point of view, e.g. the wedding, music, religion, etc. The pedestrian in front of the museum still under renovation, but you can still enter the museum from the main entrance."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"The best place to learn peranakan history. The museum have complete explanation about the history of peranakan, how they live, the culture, peranakan's famous people, etc. This museum explain Peranakan culture as a whole, not only Peranakan in Singspore. The first room in this museum already fascinated me. It have many people stories about their identity, and their parent's stories that came from China or India. As you move to one room and another you can see types of peranakan house, tools, song, tradition, etc.

The interesting thing if this museum is they give a paper with stamps you can collect in different corner of the museum. I highly recommend this museum for kids, people who just curious and want to know more about Peranakan, and people who just want to admire the museum building (the kuseum building has a unique vintage building type)

This museum also accessible as it is near MRT station and bus stop. However, the museum is kinda hidden behind a building, as it is not located in the main road."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"The Peranakan Museum is an interesting museum housing artefacts of the Nonya/Baba lifestyle. A blend of cultures resulted in the production of vibrant colours and elaborate designs as seen in the embroidery on the women's ""Kebaya"" (blouse), slippers, ornamental decorations for the home and embroidered beadwork slippers and tablecloths. Nonyaware china specially ordered from China by the Peranakans had bright colours with designs showing phoenixes and flowers. Elaborately carved blackwood furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl showed motifs of Chinese folklore, landscapes, dragons, and signs of good fortune, prosperity and longevity.
Wedding ceremonies required elaborate costumes for the bride and groom and fine jewellery and Nonyaware for the bride, a reflection of  the lavish lifestyle of the Peranakans.

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"(Translated by Google) Very interesting for who wants to better understand who the Peranakan are. Too bad that most objects are under showcases. Small crush for the many dry stamps that can be played over the exhibition, representing auspicious symbols.

(Original)
Très intéressant pour qui veut mieux comprendre qui sont les Peranakan. Dommage que la plupart des objets soient sous vitrines. Petit coup de cœur pour les nombreux tampons à secs avec lesquels ont peut jouer au fil de l'exposition, représentant des symboles auspicieux."
Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,3,"(Translated by Google) It is located near the National Museum of the Old City of Singapore, and the etymology of Peranakan comes from a Malaysian woman and a man from another country.
(China, India, etc.) It refers to descendants born through marriage and accounts for a minority of Singaporeans.

Brightly colored embroidery, bowls, and colorful ornaments are impressive, and the museum consists of three floors.

The first floor is a picture of a Peranakan,
The 2nd floor is for weddings, wedding clothes, food for waste bags,
3rd floor is kitchen, crockery, funeral etc.
You can see the various characteristics of Peranakan.

Admission is 13 SGD per adult.
Over 60 years old is $9 per person.

When you pay the entrance fee, you get a sticker.
It can be attached to the most visible position on the top of the clothes and can be viewed. You can take pictures, but flash is not allowed.

The downside is that it is small compared to the national museum, so you can visit all floors in 2 hours, and the contents are explained only in Chinese and English, so it was difficult to understand enough.

If you have a lot of time, it's worth going at least once.
You don't have to visit.

If you are interested in culture and customs and are studying the subject, around No. 1
Recommend to go

싱가포르 올드시티 국립 박물관 주변 위치하고 있으며, 페라나칸의 어원은 말레이시아 여성과 다른나라 남성이
(중국,인도등)결혼하여 낳은 후손을 지칭하는 말로 싱가포르인 중 소수를 차지한다.

밝은색의 자수,그릇, 화려한 장신구들이 인상적이며, 박물관은 총 3층으로 구성되어 있다.

1층은 페라나칸인 사진,
2층은 웨딩, 혼례의상, 폐백용 음식,
3층은 부엌,그릇,장례등
페라나칸의 다양한 특색들을 볼 수 있다.

입장료는 성인 기준 1인당 13싱달이고
60세 이상은 1인당 9달러이다.

입장료를 지불하면, 스티커를 주는데
옷 상단 가장 잘 보이는 위치에 부착하고  관람 가능하며, 사진촬영은 가능하지만 플래쉬는 금지다.

단점으로 국립박물관치고 규모가 적은편이라, 넉넉히 2시간이면 전층 관람이 가능하며, 중국어, 영어로만 내용 설명이 되어 있어, 충분한 이해가 어려웠다.

시간이 많다면, 1번 정도는 갈 만하지만
꼭 방문 할 필요는 없다.

문화와 풍습에 대해 관심이 있고 해당 부분에 대해 공부하고 있다면, 1번 즈음
가보는 것을 추천한다."

Peranakan Museum Singapore: History & Culture,5,"(Translated by Google) I think the word ""peranakan"" is almost unfamiliar to Japanese. But when you live in Singapore, you often hear this name. The term refers to the offspring of the original inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula and the immigrants to Singapore. A museum where you can learn about their lives is the Peranakan Museum on Armenian Street. The Peranakan culture, which combines the ethnic elements of China, Malay and Tamil, gives you a gorgeous world view with the primary colors that are rare in Japan. From miscellaneous goods to food and art, you can experience unique things. There are many collections of Peranakan crafts here. Especially for women, many interesting things are on display, so I recommend it (^ ^)

(Original)
「プラナカン」という言葉は、日本人にはほとんど馴染みがないと思います。しかしシンガポールに住んでいるとこの呼び名は、よく聞くことになります。マレー半島に住んでいたもともとの住人とシンガポールに移民してきた人々との間にできた子孫のことをさす言葉となっています。その人達の生活について知ることができる博物館が、アルメニアン・ストリートにあるプラナカン博物館です。 中国、マレー、タミルの民族的要素が融合したプラナカン文化は、日本にはなかなかない原色に彩られた華やかな世界観を感じることができます。雑貨から料理、そしてアートまで、独特なものを体感できます。ここには、プラナカン工芸品のコレクションが多数あります。特に女性には、興味あるものがたくさん展示されていますので、おすすめです(^^)"

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Spent several hours going through most of the exhibitions. Interesting historical information on Singapore and its growth. Particularly liked the Picturing the Pandemic, Growing Up and Home Truly exhibitions. Museum was relatively empty which made the experience very enjoyable. Free admissions for locals.

My weird sense of humour was quite amused by the standee in place of the washing machine."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This area of Orchard Road boast quite a few museums and since the Covid19 Circuit Breaker in 2020, tourists are a thing of the past even until today in 9 August 2021, also Singapore's National Day. Other neighbouring museums such as Asian Civilisation Museum, Philatelic Museum, Singapore Art Museum, had all took the opportunity to close and renovate, rejuvenate. National Museum of Singapore currently host a long term exhibit on the History of Singapore since it's days from a small fishing village to the Metropolitan Nation state it is today. Term display currently include Pictures of the Pandemic as well as a nation building themed Home Truly, both until the 29th of August 2021. Free admission to Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents. No better way to celebrate our National Day and also reflect on the past year of Pandemic."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Well maintained and managed museum. Interesting content for exhibition. Very picturesque to take beautiful architecture.

Their current special exhibition at B1 contain interactive galleries, some display even current event like how covid-19 had affected to all walks of life in Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Visited the Singapore history section and the COVID section - loved them both. Took around 1.5 hours to go through them both
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Beautiful building, nice place to take photos, there’s a few exhibits to visit, not too crowded, entry is free for locals, just need to present IC, worth coming for a couple hours!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"National museum is a wonderful place to visit with children, and they enjoy the different galleries and even the history of Singapore including the Syonan period which was a little scary but it was a good teaching and learning experience

Showing them the earliest Singapore flats and how's life in Singapore in the earlier stages was good too =)"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Visited the Picturing the Pandemic and Home Truly special exhibitions at the end of April.
Thoughtfully curated and moving, the pandemic exhibition brings out the sacrifices and struggles of Singapore and her people during the Circuit Breaker last year.
I also enjoyed the Home Truly exhibition with its interactive exhibits. The use of the RFID tag and touch screen pen was innovative and made for an interactive, immersive experience."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Beautiful building! We spent 2 hours here going through all exhibits. It’s really cool how they demonstrate history! Suitable to go with friends or even dates:)
National Museum of Singapore,5,I am a regular patron of the museum and it's a must for me to visit the museum during Singapore National Day. Love the architectural facade of the building
National Museum of Singapore,5,Visited for the exhibition on Pandemic and Truly Home. A good experience to walk through the short but rich history of Singapore. Love the effort to include real life accounts and engaging locals to interviews for a perspective from their point of view. How people in different walks of life came through the tumultuous times of Singapore's past and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic. A really fascinating day out. We didn’t get to see the whole thing so we will be going back. Lots of insight in to Singapore’s history.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Free for Singaporeans, the National Museum is a great place to learn more about Singapore’s cultural history.

National Museum of Singapore,5,A repository of Singapore's history and we'll curated exhibitions to strengthen our social defence. Strongly recommended for families as my kids loved it too!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The national museum of Singapore has high quality permanent exhibits, which I enjoy going to every few years. The special exhibits though are where the action is at. They are always extensively researched and curated, with interesting and deep insights and facts. You’ll always step away with more perspective and appreciation of Singapore and the world whenever you take a visit.
The building itself is well maintained and, while a little messy, well laid out. Its halls alone are beautiful enough to walk around. The ongoing home exhibition is particularly nostalgic and appropriate given the macro
COVID situation (more % of SG visitors), and I would say reflects the thoughtfulness of how exhibitions are developed and presented."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"It was pretty interesting if you are into history. Like, are you aware singapore was once called cincapura? 😂"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The Home, Truly exhibition definitely brought back memories. A nostalgic and great exhibit portraying the course of development in Singapore. Worth the visit!"

National Museum of Singapore,4,The place is lovely though not much artifacts to see for a museum. Cute compared to large museums around the world like the British Museum. But they do try to compensate with special limited events such as the Doraemon exhibition.
National Museum of Singapore,4,In a oldest building that showcase all the history of Singapore in the very modern interior... Beautiful n spacious with a courtyard cafe... Worth visiting...

National Museum of Singapore,5,My four year old son loved it! The story of the forest was fascinating and the exhibits engaging and meaningful. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Quite well done, though the singapore history gallery was a bit too long and detailed (felt like there was so much on literally anyone remotely famous). Rotunda was cool but would have preferred being able to know the names of the animals. Visit was free. Lockers available. Honestly it exceeded my expectations. Building was absolutely beautiful."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Amazing experience at the gallery. The recent covid-19 exhibition as well as reminiscing about the old time of Singapore brings back. Interactive with the pen and the circular tag too!

It is very well maintained and very informative. Such a great place to learn so many things about Singapore.

The museum is also clean and well organized. It's quite big and complete.

Very well recommended for sightseeing and learning about the culture and history of Singapore. 👍👍😍👍"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Doraemon is coming to town"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"It is a great place to bring your family to visit especially for kids to see and know olden Singapore. by the way, it free for Singapore when I visited on National Day."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Good to bring your kids along, for Singaporean is free. Good experience."
National Museum of Singapore,5,This Doraemon pop up outside the National Museum is too cute.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place to spend a whole afternoon to understand Singapore history. There are also special exhibits for visit. Do keep a watch out for it!
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very informative and well organized galleries that showcases the history of Singapore
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Visited in early March before the Singapore shutdown.

This is an amazing museum on the history of Singapore from pre-colonial time through the colonial era and up to the present day. I can see the enthusiasm in which the curators lovingly put together the exhibits. The information is excellent, especially in the use of personal testimonies through audio recordings and videos.

The Singapore History Gallery has some very high quality exhibits and a fantastic mock up of the quarterdeck of a ship. My personal favourite section was the videos and audios of life and stories during the Japanese occupation. It really gives you an appreciation of how hard life was back then and just how good life is in Singapore now. This museum is one of the best things to see in Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"It is not the first time that we are visiting the NMS, but the museum never fails to give me a sense of freshness and renewal. This time round, NMS has cleverly interwoven Doraemon and the theme of travelling back in time into its galleries. You first encounter a garden of Doraemon figurines on the lawn outside, before you step through Doraemon's time travelling door into the cool halls of NMS.  Doraemon features in the main lobby as well as in some of the galleries, adding a new twist to the idea of a museum being guardian of the past. The Doraemon exhibition is a temporary feature, so head down before the year draws to a close!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place to get information on the Singapore history. Good hangout place for family during weekends.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The Story of the Forest exhibition at the glass rotunda was the best exhibit we viewed on our visit. It was a wonderful immersive art experience, especially given that it is developed by teamlab. Very enjoyable for all ages. I liked the Very Old Tree exhibit that the story of the forest exited into. The anecdotes alongside the photographs were interesting to read. The Doraemon interactive quiz (“get curious”) through the Singapore History Gallery was also a fun initiative for my young cousin to take part in. The Singapore History Gallery is a bit long to walk through though and may be tiring for some children.

Pictures below are all from the Story of the Forest exhibition."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"It is always good to come and visit the museum. Especially the exhibits of our nation in its beginning stages. Most of all, I missed Mr LKY. 😢"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Amazing place to explore in Singapore.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"we entered all the halls in this museum

the way of displaying is very cool and interesting"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Clean, modern and an artful place, one of my favourite places as a resident nerd. Bring your nerdy date here and enjoy the conversations. Will be back here regularly."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Home truly exhibition currently showing. Soak in an atmosphere of nostalgia.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Excellent place. Rich historical facts! A must visit!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"It's such a nostalgic experience for me visiting National Museum of Singapore!
My childhood favourite cartoon character, Doraemon; my childhood toys; favourite weekend activity - Jurong Open carpark Movie place... Etc...
I get to explain to them how my childhood was like..."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Right place for those who like to know the history of Singapore especially ruled by Japan.. you need to check through their web site to get the latest event information. We went there because of Doraemon event..
National Museum of Singapore,5,Had an enjoyable time there today visiting all the exhibits.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"What can I say about museum? It's either you  enjoy it or you find it bored.

And definitely it's about your companion, if they enjoy the whole museum experience, then you will love the trip too. But if you ask me, it will definitely be a good trip if you have kids learning history/social studies about Singapore. It will broaden your exposure to information not available in the usual school textbooks.

If you are visiting and driving, your can park at ""Fort Canning Public Carpark A"", it's definitely cheaper option if you don't mind making a 10-20 minutes walk to the main entrance of the museum."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great place to learn about Singapore and especially now having Doraemon exhibition at the same time
National Museum of Singapore,4,"This museum has a good display of objects that can take one to the timeline of innovation done by technology. Displaying variety of old electronics from oldest to the newest. Mostly focusses on the singapore war with the japanese and the arms and ammunition used during the war. Coins, notes, clothes etc that was used during the war. Videos of short duration in certain parts of the museum that provide visual information of the war situation.

Ticket can be taken from the counter at the museum. It has an accessibility for wheelchair and good arangements for elderly individuals. Snacks are not allowed in the museum."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"In Singapore National Museum, you can learn many things about the history of early Singapore, starting from the origin of its people, issues their faced, gross domestic product, and the transition to a modern country. And we learned that Singapore is a multicultural country with a unique background.  The museum is quite neat and beautiful and kids friendly."
National Museum of Singapore,5,I grew up watching Doraemon. This moment reminds me how I enjoyed growing up with my siblings. You are free to take photo outside the museum and free admission for PR and Singaporean inside the museum. To pay 15sgd for foreigners. This is a great place for everyone to bring your kids and take a photo with Doraemon. A quality time to enjoy with your families❤️Last day is 27th December. Must Come!🥳
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Late review/sharing after visiting NMoS over the National Day long weekend.

Love the 80s & 90s throw-back displays, and was impressed by how some installations were setup (i.e. drive through movies)."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Cool place for a date or casual trip. Free entry for singaporeans. Check out the different themes e.g. Japanese occupation. The location is easy to find and near SMU. So transportation is not an issue. Though some of the museum spots are rather dark, would be better if the lighting is not as dark. Overall good experience!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,We had a fun time with the Doraemon special during the Dec holidays.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Whenever you visit to any country, you should visit to their national museum to understand the history.
For Singapore, there’s not much historical things as other country.
But worth to give a go there by understanding their culture.
The museum makes more interesting things by using the lighting. Presentation is really good.

I love the architecture of the building.
When we enter the room, the living room style of old Singapore is shown.

And i found one quote that mentions “ Life had to go on. Everybody just tried their best to survive and hope for better time”.

That’s presenting of how they tried to become Singapore.

Luckily I got the chance to visit there with the free entry as there is special holidays (I don’t remember exactly, i think it’s the lunar day or something like this 😅😅😅)"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"It's a nice museum with lots to learn and many different exhibitions changing over time.
Everytime I go there is bound to be a new exhibition!
Good place to recommend for tourist or Singaporeans who want to learn about Singapore's past."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Very nice, airy, grand place to stay n spend time. As an ordinary people, nothing much to study deep. But a place to enjoy n relax is more important. Doraemon is an value added event."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Visited ‘home, truly’ exhibition and it’s one of the best I’ve been. Highly recommended, extremely interactive and very real. A consolidation of the story/ snippets of what make Singapore, Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The place to learn about Singapore’s history, this place takes you through what happened in Singapore in the last few hundred years to shape what it is today. Very educational and suitable for families to have a day visit. There are some interactive exhibits to keep kids entertained.

The place is well maintained and recently refurbished. Service staff were fantastic. Cafe on site."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Beautiful place to spend time with friends and family, this place has everything from galleries to good food. A boys school from the colonial period has changed into a museum, this piece would have seen a lot of history from dependence to independence and now futuristic installations."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Never gets tired of it ! Love the ambience, the building and the stories they have. A pride of Singapore"
National Museum of Singapore,4,Many interesting special exhibitions at times. It also has a gallery to tell the history of Singapore. Good place to know how Singapore looks in the past. It is also the most popular spot to explore during the Summer light night.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Good place to spend an afternoon with your kids.
National Museum of Singapore,5,I had two years of employment in Singapore. And I love art and history. This museum is....more than great! I loved it. I visited it three times. With and without audio-guide. Alone and in company. So OVERWHELMING!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Lovely place for a rainy day!
Being a jacket as it’s freezing inside during a rainy day."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Combined technology and history to make museum more interesting to the young one.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Love this place. Highly recommended for history buffs.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Still one of my favourite places to take visitors and guests for an informative and enriching visit.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Lovely place free for SG citizens and PRs.
National Museum of Singapore,4,overall it was excellent but it would be perfect at the time of my visit if there could #1 have café open #2 have the Galley 10 open or at least with a clear signboard saying it was closed #3 audio guide in place as it is a standard for all museums worldwide
National Museum of Singapore,3,"Famous place to learn Singapore history.
Good for family, good for foreigner, too.

The building, interior is nice and many valuable documents, goods here.
From the ground floor, you can go through Singapore history to go up.
There is different artistic theme museum on top floor by Team Lab from Japan.

But I think entrance fee might be high for foreigner. No fee is required to local.
To let foreigner know Singapore, it is a little sad thing."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very nice museum, coZy and clean. Now PR and citizens all free entry, must support!"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"As far as museums go, I have seen better. It does offer a very good history, both old and more recent about Singapore. It is very, very dark inside, and though there are a lot of exhibits, some of them are impossible to read. You could spend anywhere from 1.5  to several hours in there depending on how deep you want to dive. Overall, good value for the money."
National Museum of Singapore,5,All articles and exhibits are well exhibited and highlighted. Place is fully air conditioned and equipped. Kind staff provides all necessary information. I recommend a guided tour inside which is offered free of charges at designated hours. It helps to get first impression and initial information about the articles and exhibitions there.
National Museum of Singapore,5,National pride and beauty. Wonderful and perfect place
National Museum of Singapore,5,"You can easily spend half a day at the museum. We saw the 2 exhibitions on old world, new world and Singapore's heritage. The museum is kid friendly, has a cafe if you have food cravings while watching, activity areas and much more."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"2021, Aug 02, one week before National Day"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Went there on a weekday for the Packaging Matters exhibition and walk around for the history of Singapore.

Was quite amazed with the creativity of people to design the exhibition to make it very interesting. As well as there is add-on activity for people to try out which makes everything more exciting.

Its worth to visit if you are a museum-hopper and just addition note that there will be a lot of students in the afternoon as they are there for school excursion!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Wonderful time travelling with Doraemon
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Wonderful architecture.. Good place for learning about Singapore.. I love the secret forest, it's amazing light. Free entrance ticket for university student. 👍👍👍"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very nice museum. Revisit after the renovation with Doraemon exhibitions.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"No entrance fee. Excellent staff service. They were so patient with our 88 and 89 years old parents who needed more time to disembark from the car. One even guided us to get wheelchairs for them. And free loan of wheelchairs too. We only managed to view the first level exhibits. Didnt have time for other levels as we went after lunch. Currently it is showcasing History of Singapore. Memories of old Singapore was something we could resonate with. The separation of Singapore from Malaysia showing in the video was a place where many visitors stopped to watch.

Haven't been to the museum for past 30 years, this is a good place to visit."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Loved it! History of Singapore all the way back in time. Pretty quiet and has very interesting facts and items that the museum displays. Educational and Family vibes. Free entrance for Singaporeans. Just need to bring IC.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Love the Doraemon exhibition 😍
National Museum of Singapore,4,"A lot of information to digest but housed in an old beautiful building that has been well maintained. Consuming all of that info felt like being transported back in time, what a very different place Singapore used to be and how much it has developed even in the last 50 years.

$15 entry fee for non-Singaporeans/PRs however it’s free admission for the temporary exhibitions in the basement. About a 5-10 minute walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice clean and fun !
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Take the guided tour. Be on time. Pretty much amazing to get to know Singapore better, the past and how it developed at faster pace to it's present condition. Lots to learn and take home"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This is the absolute, must-see museum about  Singapore or Singapura and this region. You have to spend at least 3-4 hours to totally enjoy and learn all the facts about this amazing tiny nation and it's resourceful people. You will be moved when you see the country's founder cried."
National Museum of Singapore,4,I have been to National Museum a couple of times but this Story of the Forest is new for me. This was created by Team Lab and it is a nice break from the other galleries. It utilizes cutting-edge technology to transform 68 drawings which comes to life and interact with visitors as they make their way down the Glass Rotunda. Fun for the younger kids if they are bored from the other galleries which are more serious and informative.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Today's event at the National Museum. Fun place for the family.
National Museum of Singapore,5,The museum is very designed and interactive. Very impressed. Brought my toddler (16months) to visit. Even though she could not really understand but she enjoyed herself. Will come back again when she is older.
National Museum of Singapore,5,This place is a must for visitors.  Singapore does a lot of things really well and this museum is no exception.  Super high tech exhibitions with tons of detail and sensory stimulation.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Nice place to chill and relax if time allows..

Very near to dohby ghuat"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"free entrance for singapore citizens and pr,

National Museum of Singapore,4,An interesting place to learn more about Singapore history
National Museum of Singapore,5,Noting to say much. Great place to visit as a tourist. History of Singapore and how they become 1 of the best country in the world. Nice restaurant at entrance as well.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"National Museum is the place to go to understand Singapore’s rich heritage and history.

In a quaint beautifully conserved building, the exhibitions inside elegantly narrate the Singapore story and journey from its discovery by the British empire in 1819, through the Japanese occupation in World War 2, independence from British, merger with Malaya, all through til modern day independent Singapore.

More than that, it also does great in portraying the life and culture of everyday Singaporeans. Until Mar 2020, they are also having ‘An Old New World’  exhibition covering the 700 years of history leading up to Britain’s discovery.

Definitely recommend this for all history and culture buffs out there :)"
National Museum of Singapore,4,Lotsa history to see. And currently there's doraemon too!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Awesome and very exploring experience.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the latest interactive displays and immersive experiences offered by the current exhibits. Good for a couple of hours stroll to learn about Singapore history and experiences through the years past. Also included exhibits through modern Singapore growing years, which would connect well with those seeking nostalgia."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Arrangement of the exhibits was great given that it was an old building with nooks and corners. We'll done folks at the National Museum.
National Museum of Singapore,5,A must visit museum. Entrance fee is a bit expensive but it was worth the experience. An amazing exhibitions. kudos to the curator.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Lighting of National museum. Beware of $4 parking entry rate
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Nice place. Good place to learn about the Singapore Story. 700 years of history in one place is something a textbook cannot hope to achieve. A look into the history of Singapore like no other, except when some grandfathers start telling their stories. Hope to be one of the exhibits next time."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Great experience learning many histories of Singapore but ticket price is expensive else I would had rate it a 5 stars
National Museum of Singapore,4,Spacious and well thought out. Though if the exhibition changed more frequently will be ideal.
National Museum of Singapore,5,We went there during Children Biennale and we had lots of fun there. They created spaces for children to explore and be curious. Good for itchy little hands. The staff there are really good and they explain the meaning and the story of the installation arts.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Wonderful museum that is perfectly curated. Ticketing staff suggested starting in the second floor galleries for Singaporean history and then continuing to the first floor gallery. I would have preferred the other way round so some chronology is maintained. The packaging exhibition was stunning but felt more information on the future of packaging was needed.
National Museum of Singapore,4,Interesting place to visit.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Well curated. A great introduction to the history of Singapore
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Brought the kids to the national museum as it’s part of Singapore night festival light-up.

Very interesting light shows that not only the kids found them interesting, but we as adults loved them too."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Great place to learn about the history of Singapore. And there's a amazing cafe in the museum. The explanation by the docent was absolutely fantastic. I didn't regret waiting for the guided tour.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Great story telling that i can say for this wonderful museum. Galleries are thoroughly engrossing, having set pieces that brought that nostalgic sentiment from all of us . The Paul Revere bell  blew us away, though! Nice touch for the numbers on each label to guide you where to go next. However, the areas of interest are not physically sequential hence you would have to find your way to see label 1005 coming from label 1004 for example. A humble suggestion perhaps on  identifying the  sequence of galleries to go next like in Malaysia. Overall, a splendid experience if you ask me!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very nice exhibits. For good eating, go to the tea party express across the street for some affordable pasta!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Amazing museum. I wasn't expecting much. Initially planned to spend no more than
2 hours but ended up spending over 4 hours. The exhibits were engaging and educational. I particularly enjoyed the Syonan period exhibit and post-independence exhibition. A wonderful
Place to learn about Singapore especially if you are not interested in superficial attractions."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Probably the most amazing ""national museum"" I've been, and I've traveled quite a bit. The mix between a tradicional museum and modem technology features makes the visiting experience extremely enjoyable and fluid. Definitely a must-visit in Singapore!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"2019 Singapore night festival is awesome.
Free admission from 7pm till 31st August. Visiting museum at midnight with lights is a spectacular experience!"

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Super fantastic experiences. A place to learn about Singapore History. There’s many room and each room represent an era of Singapore History. The interior, audio, and artifacts makes you really feel like in that era (you can also smell the aroma of plants here). Spending 2-3 hours to explore this museum and it’s worth your time. The entry fee for student is 10SGD (non Singaporean)."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great works done to our historical facts.
National Museum of Singapore,5,A beautiful structure and a wonderfully curated museum
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very nice building

Do check those out!"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"My sister artwork is there in the exhibition, ""Picture The Pandemic"". Very cool, go check it out. Adar Ng"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The National Museum is just a classy place to hang out and take in a bit of Singapore and its heritage. Ultra modern decor greets you as you enter this place, from the glass bottom water roof to the beautifully done wood interiors. Too many things to see and do here. It has to be on your list of places to visit in Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very nice place
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice museum. But i came here late so i couldn't focus on the whole exhibition. The glass rotunda exhibition really gave me a goosebumps. It's soooo pretty. And the staffs are so kind.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Visit doraemon. Inside museum also have doraemon. Don't miss out.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"This museum presents the natural, cultural, and political history of Singapore, with a particular emphasis on the country’s economic success after it gained independence in 1965. The narrative is nostalgic and optimistic, turning matter-of-factly when it’s convenient.

I particularly enjoyed ‘Story of the Forest’, an enchanting presentation of the flora and fauna of the region. You can check it out at the museum’s Glass Rotunda.

The museum is housed in a modern and spacious building in downtown Singapore. We stayed for three hours until closing, and would have stayed longer if there was more time."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Engaging. Thank you for being so thoughtful on the activities and exhibits.
National Museum of Singapore,5,A lot of historical and interesting things about Singapore can be learned here. Museum architecture is very beautiful. Normally there's admission fee here for foreigners but when we went here last CNY holiday it was free! So awesome.

Its exhibition is also very educational."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Must go to place!
The National Museum of Singapore is not one of the biggest in the world but it captures the transition from old to present very well. For a non Singaporean, this gives an exciting summary of how Singapore was a few decades ago and how quickly it had been transformed into a leading first world country. It is very well maintained, clean and the staff are courteous and helpful!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I love to visit national museum of Singapore,  last visit was went to see the doreamon, convenient and accessible place."
National Museum of Singapore,5,beautiful place. spent hours here checking out with the family before the phase 2 lockdown
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Truly a must see place while in Singapore.  Learned a lot from the exhibition ""An Old New World""."

National Museum of Singapore,5,Beautiful Museum I can't ask for more just excellent.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Its a really nice place with free admission for singapore residents. Even if ure not into history/art you can always come here to admire the architecture and certain aesthetic places to take pictures at. Would recommend for a museum date for couples of all ages. Heres some photos of artefacts that i took!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Amazing place to visit, spent few hours easily learning about Singapore history. Recommend you visit on a rainy day."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Enjoyed this place. Had some good history right from the start of Singapore to modern day. Including wars, colonial times and the development of what Singapore has become today.

Worth a visit on a warm day. Good air con (was too cold even)

Very close to a food court one block down, so can leave for lunch.

Entrance is 15$S for and adult, 10 for students"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Quite small but interesting museum. The art exhibits are worth it alone. It would be a shame to be in Singapore and miss this, even though it wont take you more than a couple of hours. Dont expect UK levels of stewardship."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Fabulous museum. History of Singapore is really amazing. Friendly staff and great location. Make sure you allocate 4-6 hours so you can see the entire place. Very close to Chiymes so lots of food options as well!
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Words don't do justice for how brilliant this museum is. If you're in Singapore, this is a must visit just so you can realize how well the Singaporeans immortalized the history of their country, including the modern history (1920 upward), which is a rare sight to behold in most museums I have been in my life. Exploring the whole museum in detail (since they provide a description of all objects on display, a recording relevant to the era on exhibition, and the various items up for the museum-goers to interact with) would take you more than 3 hours; but it's a three hour well-spent. The museum's architecture is a beautiful mixture of modernity and history - a balance that is apparent even in Singapore's society now."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Educational trip down the history of Singapore.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"1st time here...trip was fruitful. But unfortunately, duration was short so didnt get to explore everything.Might visit again😁A very informative place to visit.I went for the history of NTUC exhibition.👍"
National Museum of Singapore,5,I feel that we as Singaporean we should visit our National Museum at least once. If we have friends or relatives from oversea we should bring them there to let them know our history of nation building.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"I learnt a lot the modern history of Singapore. The demonstrative materials are well organized in both words and videos, even with some game."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great family outing spot

I appreciate this country so much. I hope to back there again. I totally recommend this place to my friends. Remember to enjoy Art Gallery there."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Jz felt like travel to the past, get free entrance coz meet national dy of Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Enjoyed my time at the Museum, the exhibits were numerous, with plenty to see and do..."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Singapore’s oldest museum is a progressive showcase of the country’s history and culture.

If you have time to visit only one place to learn about the history and culture of Singapore, this is probably it. The National Museum of Singapore tells you the intriguing story of this country in a manner that is both fun and rewarding.

With its history dating back to 1887, the National Museum is the nation’s oldest, and one of the city’s architectural icons. Its permanent offerings, the Singapore History and Living Galleries, piece together the past and present in a compelling narrative."
National Museum of Singapore,4,A nice place to learn more about Singapore🇸🇬. I loved this place💖.

Honestly, I learned so much about Singapore’s history and culture from the well-crafted exhibits. Who wouldn’t want to discover how Singapore grew from a small dot of a trading hub into one of the world’s top business hubs? It’s definitely not a place to miss for a tourist and local alike."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"A museum that is worth watching! It entails all the important historical facts about Singapore. With reasonable ticket price, you can wander in this place for the whole
day!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Singaporeans get free access. Make sure you have whole day available and slowly venture through the galleries to learn and understand more about Singapore and other nations in relation. No worries as there are resting points. All ages are welcomed.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"A museum with plenty of interactive install and booth, very informative and creative. Prepare to spend up to 3 hrs if you wish to visit all exhibition halls."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The National museum is simply an amazing experience, it shows the whole history of a rocky island that was once part of the malayan kingdom, a british colony and nowadays singapore.

You'll find the whole history of singapore through a timeline that goes from 1299 to 2015."
National Museum of Singapore,5,One of the best history museums I've ever been to. The multimedia really brings this place to life and I learned a ton about the history of Singapore in an afternoon which put the whole country into context. The street names starting making sense!
National Museum of Singapore,5,Second picture is taken at the entrance of fort canning while the other two was taken on our way back to school. Had a fun time there and it's a good place to visit when coming for a vacation to singapore! Credits to my friend for taking this picture.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Definitely a place to visit if you’re in town. We enjoyed learning about the history of Singapore and how it came to be such a culturally diverse hub in Asia. Additionally, the Story of the Forest  exhibition was a wonderful sensory experience."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great experience of Singapore. Easy to come by bus and the MRT systems. Thanks to the location,the space around the building is green and relaxable. The relics is     abundant, from a great deal of period of times, I felt the museum was a time machine which starting from the First century to the 21st one. With a perfect way of arrangement, you can enjoy the best in just 3 and a half hours. Attentions are that the opening time is a little bit late but the closing time is too early, also the temperature of the air-con is a little cold."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"In about an hour I got a good overview of Singapore history in word, photos and documents.  Lots more to see but ran out of time."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Was there for the home, truly exhibition. It was very enriching and can see the efforts made. It is worth a trip to go down the memory lane and perhaps it can bring new light to whatever you have in mind...and what is there not to like if there is aircon in such a hot country haha"
National Museum of Singapore,5,nice doraemon expo...all time favorite
National Museum of Singapore,5,Superb combination of historic artifacts and audio-visual presentations. Really impressed with the presentation inside the glass rotunda. Nice contemporary interiors for displays within a stately structure. Well worth your time for an understanding how the city/nation of Singapore you see today came to be.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Didn't regret taking my leave to spend time at this place
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Essential to visit for a look at Singapore history. Lots of interesting exhibits, including an interesting panoramic digital display based on WWII. I thought the price was a little steep for what is on offer compared to other museums I have visited around the world, but still consider this an essential stop, particularly for history buffs."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I didn't get to go into many of the exhibits because of time but I'd definitely recommend a visit and make a day of it.

Will definitely be returning but for what I did say I can say it seemed truly fascinating."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"One of the best museums in SE Asia. Well curated, extraordinary artefacts, detailed descriptions and perfectly competent staff. Please plan in at least 5 hours if you want to see all exhibitions. The cafe in the museum is one of the best casual food places in Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great place to discover the history and facts of Singapore. From Malay kingdom to British colony and Singapore independence  ; worth the visit
National Museum of Singapore,4,Nice upkeep. Maybe the myth and magic segment is a bit too small ^^” I like the insight to Japanese colonization.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The museum is divided into distinct stages of Singapore's, from when it was Singapura, then a British Colony, through Japanese occupation and until the present day. The museum does a good job documenting experiences of multiple ethnic groups throughout the nation's history.

As for the exhibits themselves, they are sometimes interactive, and they tell the story of Singapore through written plaques, artifacts, replicas, film, etc. The history is high quality. I paid the student discount, price S$10"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Big place
Comfortable and cool 😎😊"
National Museum of Singapore,2,"First visit to the museum and found all displays well planned out, educational and informative, save for one poor mannered female staff. We barely sat to watch an video exhibit n she asked us to leave with no good reason.  We did not want to create a scene n left. I wanted to get her name for reporting but she disappeared quickly..  My experience was ruined by this person n I wish the museum management can look into better training n impart courteousness to the staffs. After all, the museum represents Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Besides knowing more about the history of Singapore, the National Museum of Singapore organises many fringe activities. It's not uncommon to see huge crowds of families during public or school holidays. Parents will appreciate the activities available to keep the kids engaged."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"A must visit if you like to know about the history of Singapore.

I usually like visiting museums, but I never thought that I would enjoy this one this much.

The museum was structured in a way to give information about Singapore's history in simple and easy way to follow. I especially enjoyed accounts of the people who had to endure the Japanese occupation. There are many lessons to be learned from Singapore's  history even if you are not a citizen of this country.

The museum also has exhibition called ""Story of the Forest"" which is beautiful.

It is obvious to me that a lot of love and attention went to this museum and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Learn a lot of history about Singapore. Will go again one day. Do not miss Doreamon exhibition.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Always impressed by the multimedia experiences that the National Museum curates. Currently on: Growing up in Singapore through sounds, pictures, elaborate settings, Story of the forest in stunning visual and sound multimedia experience, and an interesting  exhibit of Lucy Lu's art"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The National Museum of Singapore, Singapore’s oldest existing museum (currently devoted to the general history of Singapore), seeks to inspire with stories of Singapore and the world. Its history dates back to 1849, when it opened on Stamford Road as the Raffles Library and Museum.

Designed by Colonial Engineer Sir Henry E. McCallum, the original structure (the front block of the present building) is largely Neo-Palladian in style. This architectural style is characterised by a highly symmetrical façade and the use of pediments above the windows. The large triangular pediments capping each end of the front block are adorned with the coat of arms of Queen Victoria, most likely to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the monarch’s reign in 1887 – the same year the building was declared open.

Other Neoclassical features are also incorporated into the building’s façade, such as Doric columns and pilasters on the ground level and Ionic pilasters on the second level. Neat rows of large windows ensured ample ventilation, which was very much needed in tropical Singapore before air-conditioners were installed.

One of the building’s most outstanding features is its rotunda, which is crowned with a dome covered with fish-scale tiles. Coloured glass panels and arched windows on the dome allowed the interior space to be naturally illuminated.

The Museum was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992, and subsequently renamed the Singapore History Museum from 1993 to 2006. When the museum building began redevelopment and renovation in 2003, the museum was temporarily moved to Riverside Point at Clarke Quay.

In 2006, the museum returned to its home on Stamford Road and became officially known as the National Museum of Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I really loved this museum so much!

The best museum in Singapore. So important for our history. Really enjoyed my trip there."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Anyone who wants to learn as much about the history of Singapore as quickly as possible should spend a few hours in this museum. It has something for everyone, and it is well worth the ticket price."
National Museum of Singapore,5,I had a grand time learning about Singapore's history. I came at around 10AM on a Wednesday and I found myself alone in exhibit rooms most of the time. The staff are nice. I especially liked their exhibit about the Japanese conquest as Singapore and the Philippines share that event in history.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Lovely museum - could spend hours there

National Museum of Singapore,4,"A beautiful building. And exhibitions that really go in depth into the history of Singapore and the world.

Only criticism - perhaps there's too much of an emphasis on Covid 19 related themes. The horror of the pandemic is still raw and ongoing, not too many people would like to be continuously reminded of the worst times (eg circuit breaker period)"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Attended #SgNightFest which was an awesome experience. Love it very much.
National Museum of Singapore,4,Went to the museum for the bicentennial exhibition that is on till the end of the year. Exhibition was about Singapore before 1819 and how raffles came to Singapore. This exhibition is rather intresting as it shows personal recounts of raffles and Fahrquar's sightings about Singapore and it shows how they found Singapore.
National Museum of Singapore,1,The Doreamon Adventure was a let down. There are just 2 Doreamon figures inside the museum....
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice decoration for national day
National Museum of Singapore,5,Be sure to visit National Museum to experience a new way for interaction during this COVID pandemic.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"National Museums is currently having a cute robot cat is invading the National Museum of Singapore until Dec 27.
Doraemon might not seem an obvious programming choice for a history museum, but director Chung May Khuen points out that the Japanese cartoon character is a beloved pop culture icon in Singapore.
Noting that the show has been dubbed into Malay and is still broadcast on television today, the self-confessed Doraemon fan says: ""Singaporeans have been watching Doraemon from the 1980s. It does play a part in our growing up years."" Besides a line of Doraemon figures marching across the museum's front lawn, fans of the cartoon character can snap Instagrammy selfies at booths scattered through the building. There will be, of course, an Anywhere Door for fans to imagine themselves transported to a destination of their choice. Devotees can also pick up limited edition merchandise designed by local lifestyle brand Supermama.
Admission: Is free for Singaporeans and permanent residents"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Such a gorgeously curated museum.

Silly fact for those of you with kids who want to add some mystery...

SPOOKY SINGAPORE TRAIL FACT
The spiral staircase that leads up onto the roof of the museum isn’t open to visitors anymore, but even if it was, it is said that a mysterious force would stop you when you tried and would trip you up.

Some claim to have seen a priest-like figure or museum director on the stairs and so now these stairs are only cleaned twice a week!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I always love to learn from history. The national museum tells a lot stories of the past, with all the exhibits, photos and videos. It requires $15SGD to get into the gallery but most part of the museum is free. Highly recommended for tourists."

National Museum of Singapore,2,"THE MUSEUM, OUTSIDE IS ELEGANT, BUT INSIDE NOT GOOD SERVICE, TO IMPROVE. LOCAL STAFF NOT VERY JUDICIOUS. SINGAPORE IS MORE BEAUTIFUL IN ITS ANCIENT BRITISH ARCHITECTURE. (JB 1841)"
National Museum of Singapore,5,My first week in Singapore so wanted to know about the history and it's culture and must admit it's very impressive work done inside the museum. I really started appreciating how visionaries have put in a lot of hard work in making what Singapore is today. One must make this their 1st in the list of things to do in Singapore.

National Museum of Singapore,4,"I only walked through the history gallery and sought and succeeded to know the Citystate's history as it sees it.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Had a great time learning about history of Singapore. All exhibitions were well thoughtout
National Museum of Singapore,4,"There are huge amount of information in the exhibition of history of the city and that didn't interest me to look further other than taking some shots. The most interesting part of the museum may be the digital flower animation at the top floor. But it's a rich exhibition with various resources some of which you would find interesting overall. If paying SD15 or the long time you would spend would make you feel something, you may think about skipping this attraction for the Asian Civilization Museum which might have a better value for less."
National Museum of Singapore,5,The place was great to visit . You can spend your time here with your friends or family. You guys should come 😀

National Museum of Singapore,5,Interesting & Informative
National Museum of Singapore,5,"You would think that Singapore is a modern place and therefore does not have a long history? So the national history museum will not be that interesting, right? WRONG! This museum narrates Singapores' history in a really interesting and engaging way. Of course most of the emphasis is on the 20th century. There are also some nice temporary art exhibitions. Like other museums in Singapore, tickets aren't cheap but it's certainly worth it. If you want to see everything expect to spend at least three hours here."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This Meseum is beautiful and very well maintained. If your interest is about Singapore history, this is an awesome place to spend your time. Great job!"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Awesome Galleries, very friendly staff from the greeter at the door, ticketing, security within the galleries, but alas the Museum Shop staff are disappointing. All engrossed in their own world. And yes, the merchandises are underwhelming compared to what is what I feel an awesome work done for the galleries. Museum merchandise are so vital to visitors, make it well and you'd have the likes of the British Museum world class standard forever ingrained in the minds of the visitors.

Just saying..."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Elegant building with some interesting bits of history and installations, if a little sparse on actual content. You need to pay $18 to see most of the exhibitions. Some interesting free bits in the communal areas."

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Singapore National Museum.

This is one of the most important museums in Singapore since 1849, which collects historical documents and acts as a museum.

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Very nice building, went for an amazing temporary exhibition called “An old new World”"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Definitely one place for you to go if you're interested more in the history of Singapore and the development of the nation and Singapore people itself. There are several different areas of the museum themed by the development era, not to mention the majestic architectural and interior design of the museum itself.

Inside the museum you will find a tremendous amount of historical artifacts and stories. Starting from as early as 15th century up until today. From the era of Raffles up to its independence back in the sixties. All of the aspects are presented in a manner that can be perceived as highly experiential for me as a first timer. For you that sharing the same taste of knowledgeable traveling, this is one of the most important destination in Singapore."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Intetesting place to learn about singapore!
Wish the place is brighter for the kids as my kid feel quite eerie at certain area."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Museum tells the story & history of Singapore.  Tours in English at 11am and 2 pm on Weekdays in every 1 hour for one hour and  20 participants only. Must go place. Next visit
When raining and weather not good you can utilize the time."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Really informative and well designed museum. The displays were nicely spaced out to not be overwhelming, and the general low lighting but highlighted artefacts helped guide you through the rooms. Occasionally, felt a little lost as we weren't sure which way to turn but most rooms met up."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Staggering to see what a nation has achieved in 53 years of independence - fantastic exhibits, particularly enjoyed the rain forest exhibit"
National Museum of Singapore,4,A place is worth to visit. Book ticket by klook application would be cheaper a little bit. There are 2 floors to visit. I'm really suprised for the 2ndF. Sure that you should not miss any room in here. Time for visiting around 2 hours is minimum for me.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"The National Museum of Singapore is the oldest museum in Singapore. Its history dates back to 1849, when it was started as a section of a library at Singapore Institutionand called the Raffles Library and Museum. After several relocations, in 1887 it moved to its permanent site at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area.

The museum focuses on exhibits related to the history of Singapore. It is one of four national museums in the country, the other three being the two Asian Civilisations Museums at Empress Place Building and Old Tao Nan School, and the Singapore Art Museum. It was named the National Museum of Singapore in 1965; between 1993 and March 2006, it was known as the Singapore History Museum.

The National Museum of Singapore underwent a three-and-a-half-year restoration and reopened on 2 December 2006, with the official reopening by former President of Singapore S. R. Nathan and the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts taking place on 7 December 2006.[1] The Singapore History Gallery opened on 8 December of the same year."

National Museum of Singapore,4,Doraemon fans rejoice. Complete the event missions and get a free gift! Also take a leisure stroll through the place and enjoy the ambience with your loved ones.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Beautiful museum and well worth the $15 entry fee. Definitely worth checking out the History gallery, the Very Old Tree exhibit, and the Story of the Forest exhibit. There's a lot to the history gallery so I'd suggest checking out the free tours the museum offers, which provide a comprehensive walk-through in only about 75 minutes (11 am and 2 pm). The Story of the Forest is a visually stunning and immersive video display of the Singaporean Flora and Fauna - amazing to look at, but not much substance."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Beautiful building.  Very interested display.  Not much history
National Museum of Singapore,5,If you were interested how singapore progress till today and what happens during the Japanese occupation. Come to the museum. You will surely love it.you can learn any other than history. Like doremon cartoon exhibition.kids really like the character.

If you're hungry, there's a restaurant inside or if you want something cheap then go outside, cross the street and find Bencolen station, from there you can see a food court in a near building.

Tips for travelers: You can fill your water bottle here after a walk from Fort Canning Park."

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Not many Singaporeans go to the museums anymore. I pop in occasionally to check out the exhibits.

A good place to know a bit about Singapore first hand if you have the time. Free entrance only for locals and permanent residents"

We took pass for permanent Galleries which was for SG$15. All access pass was for SG$25. With our pass we were allowed to visit level 1 and 2. History of Singapore and in level 2, five Galleries focussing on humble beginning to present day metropolis. Despite its rich historic background the museum adopts the cutting edge display techniques redefining traditional museum experience.
Open 10 am to 7 pm. Flash photography and videography is prohibited."
National Museum of Singapore,5,A beautiful museum in Singapore. Visited the museum for the Singapore night festival..
National Museum of Singapore,2,"To be frank, I have never heard of this museum until my girlfriend brought me here.

There's no wow factor and attractions are very limited and pretty boring despite being someone that really enjoys history.

There are better museums out there, don't waste your time. It is pretty inaccessible as well."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Really interesting museum detailing with all kinds of multimedia how Singapore came to be what it is today. Highly recommended for anyone with a vague interest in Singapore's somewhat short history.

National Museum of Singapore,4,The National Museum building celebrated its 130 years birthday this weekend. It is an iconic building which marks the Orchard Road stretch from Dhoby Ghaut MRT. I love visiting it from time to time for the exhibitions that they bring in but also great to remind myself of the history of Singapore too. Worth a visit!

National Museum of Singapore,5,Very good space to bring families. It shares a lot of culture of Singapore. The space is huge.
National Museum of Singapore,3,"Located in the vicinity of the Istana, the National Museum can easily be accessed by public transport. There are limited parking spots, so if you drive, go early to secure a lot. Otherwise, there are other parking alternatives such as Fort Canning Park or YMCA.

There are always something going on at the National Museum. Piano performances, art work display and Doraemon exhibitions.

The venue is wheelchair friendly and it has a restaurant and a souvenir shop. Just avoid weekends and public holidays due to overwhelming crowds."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The National Museum of Singapore is the oldest museum in Singapore. Its history dates back to 1849, when it was started as a section of a library at Singapore Institution and called the Raffles Library and Museum"

National Museum of Singapore,3,"The museum is ok. It didn't tell me as much about the history of Singapore as I would have liked and is a little confusing in its layout. There are typical artifacts like recovered pottery parts and old paintings.

If you're in town a few days and/or really love history and museums it may be worth visiting. If your time in the city is short skip the museum and save your money."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Good to get a glimpse into Singapore's history. Some exhibits are closed due though.

National Museum of Singapore,4,"The entrance fee was $10 (special price because I'm regarded as a foreign student in which I had to show my uni id card). The museum is very well maintained, the staff were welcoming, the toilet are also clean. They do have a maintenance on one side of the escalator the whole time I was in the museum (4hrs), but it's fine because there's an elevator on site.

I was lucky to join the Friday 11.00 am tour by the wonderful Florence for the Singapore History Gallery. But sadly the gallery was a bit crowded at the time (a lot of school groups and tourist groups making a lot of noises) and were blocking some of the already-narrow hallways. There is (I assume) a crowd control staff but he is only stationed at the front part of the gallery.

Recommended for Singapore first timers to get a glimpse of how this nation was conceived, or to just escape from the hot Singaporean sun :) This is actually my second visit in 2 years and I still find my visit enjoyable."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"If you want to learn about Singapore Story, the Gallery inside the museum is really great !"

National Museum of Singapore,5,Good for young children..less crowded coz of covid-19..
National Museum of Singapore,5,I really enjoyed the National Museum a lot. Got to see a photo exhibition which is about story matters and all these photos speaks a lot to me and touches my heart.

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Nice great exhibits, especially for those who love old artifacts, friendly security staff, but can't say the same for their temporary staff, especially those managing the queue at indoor Doraemon exhibit. If you go at the wrong time you'll encounter one young male with curly hair who is rude and sarcastic to the visitors as though they shouldn't be in the museum. Visited thrice this month, experience was spoilt by the rude young chap today."
National Museum of Singapore,5,The staff are polite and informative
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The museum is a great place!
However, visitors should take note that the whole area in front of the museum is actually roads for cars.
I was almost knocked down by this taxi when entering the museum."

National Museum of Singapore,5,Great leisure and educational place for the family. Wife was absorbed by the Syonan-To era shared by the museum. Can have a nice walk at the Peranakan museum stretch nearby too. The whole experience is heartening as a local. My only grouse is the terrible exposed warped raised floors that are the National Museum exhibition floor. What happened there???

National Museum of Singapore,4,"I went there because my student whom I was teaching English wanted to learn about the history of Singapore and our founder, Stamford Raffles.
The museum guide was really good as she spoke slowly and clearly. I took notes and photos for the benefit of my student.
I would like to go there again as I didn't get to see the other gallery as my student had to leave."
National Museum of Singapore,3,"Came for the Old New World exhibits, had lunch at Food for Thought, and continue to see other exhibits on Lv 2, on Thur.  My toddler was not ready for the dark environment. My older boy got bored and started playing pokemon on his mobile.  For the Old New World exhibits, there was a booklet for my older boy to fill in the space and keep the book which is useful. I also took another booklet to guide us through the exhibit but I could hardly read anything inside and trying to look after my toddler."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very nice especially after they renovated the entire place. Should really check out the museum during the night festival if possible too.
National Museum of Singapore,4,Went to Old New World Exhibition. Didn't know the history of the past. Good info.
National Museum of Singapore,5,It's really good place to visit.  You will know the history of Singapore and how's special of this country.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Each exhibition was informative and engaging as the displays matched the era it was depicting. Would recommend at least 4 hours to appreciate everything in store in this museum. The history of Singapore exhibition is a must for tourists.
National Museum of Singapore,5,The doraemon campaign certainly boost up the visitorship :) it was nice and sufficient crowd management process is in place.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"This is a small museum detailing the birth of Singapore. Please don’t try to compare this museum with the “old” and venerable museums of Europe. You will not see Van Gogh or Picasso, but you got to give it credit for what it attempts to bring to the public. They did a great job on their war era collection that is interactive."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I personally feel that it always good to visit the museums if possible as you can always learn about the culture and be exposed to the country's history. The pictures are taken by me when I visited today and I was amazed by how much I missed out. The place has rich history  and artefacts that were not shown / thought in history classes. If you would like a more in depth introduction, it is possible to join a guided tour or download the app which has pre-recorded guides (you can use the in-house wifi). This is definately a place you should visit. I suggest leaving one day to explore the place as it is quite big."

They have free group tours at certain hours, a good way to learn more from the very knowledgeable tour guides and get to meet other tourist. Tip: the moment you enter the hall, look up. The dome is beautiful. Save money: Ticket at the counter is $15 for tourist. I got mine via Klook app at $14. Use coupon code 2GUMQW to get $5 off when you sign up."

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Pretty good exhibits overall, I particularly enjoyed the early Singapore/maritime trade exhibit at B1, the highlight of which was the embryo of a manatee in a jar. But the glass rotunda was a miss for me, maybe children and tree enthusiasts would enjoy it more.The police exhibit at level 1 was alright as well. The exit of the museum was pretty confusing though, you can’t leave through the entrance."
National Museum of Singapore,5,loved the hunt for doraemon and getting the collectible after answering the questions at every station
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Well worth a visit. Huge musuem near the bustling orchard road. It has intricate designs from a view. How spectacular!

Clean air condition museum. On the top level, there was a garden with towering trees, skilfully trimmed bushes and beautiful flowers that offer flora and fauna.

In addition to existing building itself, the basement was added and the structure was strengthened. And new bridge was built to connect the third level of old and new constructions. Also, another glass ceilings were added to make shelter to the (previous) outdoor parts of buildings.

The outdoor stone wall is always clean, which gives clarity to superb maintenance.

No wonder lately Singapore is chosen as the best city in Asia."

My mistake, I guess.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"This museum should be on the checklist of every tourists visiting Singapore, especially history-goers. For a reasonable fee of $15 per adult, you can enjoy all permanent galleries in the museum. An extra fee and ticket is available for those who wish to visit the museum exhibition. Get an entrance fee discount if you're a student simply by showing your student ID, even if you're a non-Singaporean and/or studying outside Singapore. My Indonesian university student card can be used to get such concession.

The permanent galleries showcases the history of Singapore from ancient times, European colonization, Japanese colonization, until modern Singapore. As the galleries are quite extensive, prepare yourself at least 3 hours to explore the whole museum.

The museum can be reached from two nearby MRT stations: Bras Basah or Bencoolen."

National Museum of Singapore,3,"Went there because of the Doraemon’s Time-Travelling Adventures which was super disappointing!

I was guided to book the tickets online, thinking it is for the crowd-control especially during this Covid-19 situation yet only to know that it is not necessary. Of course, it was packed with people on Saturday.

All I got to see was a few different Doraemon standing outside and 1 Doraemon with his time traveling machine and his sister.

On the other hand, there are exhibits of stuff of Singapore’s history that was much more interesting than Doraemon. I suspect Doraemon is just a bait to get people go check out on Singapore’s history, haha!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Very interesting to see Singapore’s evolution.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Beautiful place to visit and learn about our local history. Also a great place for dates :)

National Museum of Singapore,5,Best place to learn about the history of Singapore
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This is officially my favourite museum now and the best part of my trip to Singapore. The building is gorgeous and the people who work there are very friendly. Upstairs they have different rooms each depicting a period in Singapore's history and it's done so well, with music and decorations! It really makes you appreciate this young country's history and the progress they have achieved so quickly. There is also a round ''tower'' kind of room with music and interactive video projections, it's wonderful to see. Downstairs they have the main exhibition which is super interesting. One small negative point is that the AC is very strong downstairs and it's get really cold. Also there was a VR mask but it had no batteries. Otherwise outstanding!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Quite good exhibits
National Museum of Singapore,5,Interesting. Take the tour.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Good place to see exhibitions. Clean and cool, well organized. There are also some places for coffee and foods inside"

National Museum of Singapore,4,"I haven't visited the museum for decades. Because we were invited to a wedding luncheon at Food for Thought in the museum, I took the opportunity to look at the exhibits. The sections on old Singapore was very nostalgic. Love the school collection, the party clothes, photos, toys, personal items... My childhood came to life again :)"
National Museum of Singapore,4,It's nice to visit once in a while when they have different exhibition.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great place to revise and know more about the history of Singapore.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"If you are really interested in learning how Singapore has evolved and flourished, why it embraces rich culture and progressive ideas, be prepared to spend around 5 - 6 hrs here.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"The museum is really big with many exhibitions and interesting light displays. I spent over 3hours there and couldn't finish it all (that is if you read every single information board). I reckon another hour or so would suffice to see everything in detail. The museum is extremely clean , hand sanitizer provided at every door during covid 19."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Brought my kid to the latest Children's Season and thought that it was really well crafted; the exhibits were a fun distraction and we especially​ liked GosTan Back.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place..!
National Museum of Singapore,5,I could learn Singapore history
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Loved it! I would recommend this museum to everyone. The temporary exhibit of ""packaging matters"" is what I saw and I really liked how well researched it was. I would love to go back to see the main museum collection. The building is also very well maintained from the colonial times. It can be a full day activity to explore around and see everything inside. The museum shop has some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Singapore, it's worth a visit. If you have a good budget then this shop is worth buying stuff from."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Lovely, fun filled place for me. The memories... Do not recommend it for children though..."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Really enjoy this museum.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Extremely well-curated museum that gives you a great overview of Singaporean history as viewed by Singaporeans.

National Museum of Singapore,5,I really like how they presents the timeline of singapore. Some are very important for not only Singapore but the rest of the regions. Some are not too important but they know how to make it look very important. 😁😁😁. I like the display btw. Very informatif.
National Museum of Singapore,4,Escape the crowds and the heat at the National Museum of  Singapore. It's A nice quiet place to chill and learn about Singapore's history. Not my favourite museum as the exhibits rarely change and is pretty much all of the same theme... The building is huge with lots of good spots to take photos at. Great for photo buffs and instagramers. Entry is free for locals so bring along your IC if you go.

National Museum of Singapore,5,The past is the key to the future.
National Museum of Singapore,4,"A modern museum focused on the history of Singapore. The exhibits we visited (An Old New World, Surviving Syonan, Singapore History Gallery) are informative and are deep dives into the specific themes. While the exhibits had interesting snippets and offer glimpses into life in historic Singapore, parts of the galleries can feel repetitive after a while.

If you need a break from the history deep dives, check out the “Singapore, Old Tree” and “Story of the Forest” art exhibits in the same facilities.

Admission is free for Singapore residents."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great place to be at, beautiful campus and occasionally nice events going on in the museum."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"It is good to know history of singapore. It shows how it was before, how they survive during war, how much they overcome..... Singapore today view didn't come easily. Everything is hard work. Salute to SG government"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Amaxing..very inspiring..we are learning a lot
National Museum of Singapore,5,We visited this museum for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. It is housed in a magnificent white colonial style building and has a number of exciting and informative exhibitions. As my father-in-law was captured by the Japanese in Singapore in WW2 we were particularly interested in the story of Singapore and its subsequent capture. We thought the exhibitions were very well thought out and the artefacts displayed were extremely interesting.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I have never studied singaporean history. This museum does a good job of sharing important people from all cultures who had a hand in influencing the city, not just the political figures, but also, the businessmen, school teachers, philantropists, workers, etc. It has a good balance of projection displays with artifacts, pictures, diagrams, and short, clear descriptions so it was like reading a picture book. It even has a replica of a Japanese tank used by Speilberg for a world war two movie. From a huge ship and pirate weapons to a projection of forest animals in the dome, it is well worth the price of admission. After 3 hours, you can walk away with a good overview of the city's history from women's rights to wwii hisotory to how sinaporeans lived through the decades. It isnt overwhelming like some museums that has way too much stuff and info like the curator just dumped it all in."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Interesting exhibits. Food in cafeteria is too expensive, though."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great place to come, but the food in the cafeteria FOOD FOR THOUGHT is too expensive to consume, each/individual opinion no obligation."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Enjoy the gallery with 3D effect and the section with mirrors
National Museum of Singapore,5,Have a nice cafe with SGD 10.70 can have nice chocolate Lava cake with Ice Cream!! Have a wonderful afternoon.

National Museum of Singapore,5,nice place. nice service
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Pretty central.
Good to add to a trip."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Wonderful illumination during Singapore night lights experience.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I love museums and Singapore has once again shown how delightful experience a museum can be. Very engaging, entertaining and enriching displays. Kids loved the ship set up inside, the displays had sensory experiences built in and Singapore and Malay history just came alive!

They have a lovely brunch cafe inside aptly named ""Food for thought"" which had a awesome food and great coffee... Would surely recommend it"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I would recommend the Singapore History guided tour. It lasts for around 1 hour and given such a short time you will be able to learn a lot about the country's history and obtain a deep appreciation of how Singapore came to be.
The tour will quickly go through the different exhibits so if you're the type who wants to take your time looking at the displays, it would be better to go around the exhibits on your own first then join the tour right after. They have a lot of audiovisual materials that you will be missing out if you only go for the tour."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great photo spot 😍.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"There is a lot of Aircon, my favourite this this one :)"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Reduced price for students - S$10
Great experience, got to explore the history of Singapore via a guided tour"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"A great place to know about the history of Singapore. There are various permanent exhibitions in the Museum whereby you get to know how Singapore has transformed over the years.

There are also modern growth since the 1920s and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers.  If you like to know how life was like during the Japanese Occupation, this is definitely a place where you get to see how Singaporeans survived through the ordeal.

If you're a Singaporean or Permanent Residents, admission is free, otherwise, it's not too much to pay either."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Study the SG history
National Museum of Singapore,5,The exhibits are interactive and one can learn a lot of Singapore's history from the museum. The architecture of the national museum is also amazing.

National Museum of Singapore,4,"Guided tours are highly recommended. Crowd could be intense on the weekends.
Some exhibits are not suitable for young children.
-Sad to observe how parents are not reminded to mind their kids when they are restless and cranky. Hope security and staff could improve on that."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Good place to visit and photography

National Museum of Singapore,5,"As Singapore's oldest museum, the National Museum of Singapore has a rather contemporary interior in a stunning colonial building. The museum is well-curated and has plenty of interactive, informative and exciting exhibits. It also houses 3 restaurants/cafes - Flutes, Food for Thought and Janice Wong. An awesome place to learn about the history of Singapore back in 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. #localguides #singapore #sg #museums"
National Museum of Singapore,3,The building itself is good but the stuff inside is not really my cup of tea.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Good opportunity to learn more about Singapore culture and history
National Museum of Singapore,5,Peace town
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very nice museum to learn more about Singapore. I had the luck to be able to see the temporary/special exhibition ""an old new world:from the east indies to the founding of Singapore, 1600s-1819"",it was fantastic! It really should be part of the permanent exhibition."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great gallery that accurately depicts the history of Singapore and the challenge it faces. Historical pieces are all around!
National Museum of Singapore,4,"I went on a weekday, lots of families with little kids visited on the same day. It was very noisy. If you don't mind the noise, and just want to have a great museum experience, you'll enjoy this place. It's a huge museum with lots of different themed rooms you can explore."
National Museum of Singapore,4,A must see for all residents and tourists!! Inexpensive and gives visitors a frame of reference and knowledge of the culture and evolution of the city state. Bring your student IDs for discounts. They honor local and international student IDs!!

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Five stars because I was lucky to take a very, very good and informative tour through the History Gallery (by Imam (?) - cannot remember the guide's name, it was a Thursday 2 pm tour, available as part of the museum entry ticket). If I didn't take the tour, then I would have given 3.5 stars for this museum, but the tour made a big difference."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Clean place, great exhibits!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The museum is very modern and pretty. Several things to see besides Singapore's past history, also modern growth since the 1920s onward in the upstairs area and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers. I found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Excellently organised displays, staff are very friendly and welcoming."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The size of the museum is just right, not too big that gets overwhelmed. A hour or two spent here would give you a nice overview of the modern history of Singapore especially on the post WWII era. The yearly World Press Photo Exhibition is also held here."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Night festival 2017 - light show
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great way to spend a few hours, very interesting history."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"There is air conditioning and the washrooms are quite clean. There are lockers to store belongings.

National Museum of Singapore,4,Nostalgic place
National Museum of Singapore,5,The museum has embark it's digital journey to allow visitors to redefine art and heritage thru technological exploitation.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This is a detailed and fascinating museum of Singapore’s history, starting with the earliest settlements through the colonial era, WWII and independence. The exhibits are thoughtfully curated and interactive, giving visitors a real glimpse into life in Singapore at various times. Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time - I would recommend two hours at least."
National Museum of Singapore,4,If you have time I would recommend the visit. Not only does it go through the history of the first settlers and then the colonial past. But what I found more interesting was how the country was transformed after the hardships of war to the current position as a major hub in asia.
National Museum of Singapore,4,Great museum to find out what Singapore is all about. They also gave a great cafe with very enjoyable food.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Absolutely loved visiting here... both the permanent exhibitions showing the history of Singapore  from its foundation ( brought to life in some brilliant immersive experiences ) and also the temporary exhibitions , which were also worth a visit"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Getting to know all about the history of Singapore through lovely displays, photos. From the start to modern day. A day well spent gaining the knowledge.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Brilliant museum! The Level 1 exposition gives a great explanation of Singapore creation, mixed culture and key historical facts. Level 2 is also a nice focus on Singaporean lifestyle during key historical events."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"The Doraemon exhibition isn't much (I'd recommend if you have children), but the museum is still worth the visit :)"

National Museum of Singapore,5,"Amazing. They had a huge (3 levels) room with projections of nature at walls and ceiling. And calming ""esoteric"" music. My kids and I layed on the ground and listened and watched for 30 minutes.
Cool
The rest was great too, but workers unions for older kids 🤣"
National Museum of Singapore,5,I really enjoyed this museum.  It covered a lot of topics on Singapore's history.  I particularly found the women's history and the industrialization exhibits interesting.  Definitely worth a visit.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very tastefully presented with interesting information from the dawn of Singapore till it's present state. It has a thorough depiction of Singapore's trade and union history, as well as a beautifully crafted exhibit called  'Rotunda of glass'. Would recommend for anyone trying to learn more about Singapore culture and history, as well as the government's focus on the future."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Lovely Colonial building with a great art display inside. Will take a fair time to go around the whole building. Fantastic water garden on top of building with a bar and great view. Great visit.

National Museum of Singapore,5,Beautiful floral rain
National Museum of Singapore,5,Excellent museum covering a wide range of topics in Singapores history - starting from perhaps 15th Century to today. Used in conjunction with the nearby 'Battlebox' (2 mins walk away) you will have everything you would want to know. Allow up to 2 hours.

National Museum of Singapore,5,absolutely prestigeous
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The best museum I've ever been too. It is beautiful and so artistically done!! There are multiple galleries as a part of the museum, each one having a beautiful theme. One could easily spend 5 to 7 hours exploring everything the museum has to offer. Lot of voice recordings and a few video recordings are present. I personally loved the history of Singapore. Wish I could have spent more time here"
National Museum of Singapore,4,Please visit it when it less crowed time.. You will manage to enjoy the time over there..
National Museum of Singapore,5,Has being coming here regularly
National Museum of Singapore,5,Good place to gain knowledge

National Museum of Singapore,5,Truly one of the best museums I've ever visited. The exhibits are all highly interactive and diverse with great detail about the history of Singapore. Would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in Singapore's past.
National Museum of Singapore,3,Superhero me at National Museum of Singapore
National Museum of Singapore,5,Worth a visit if your there for a couple of days. Nice to learn the history of Singapore. Purchased ticket off the Klook app no issues with entry.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This place is so awesome! You get to see and experience the country's history. There are also some Innovations that will surely make you say ""Wow!"". If you guys will go to Singapore, this is one of the best place to visit!😉"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Located near to the city area and besides the Singapore Management University. There's always exhibitions all year round featuring art works, immersive art installations. A great place to learn and know more about the history or culture of Singapore. It is also one the oldest architecture icons in Singapore. There are also some cafes and restaurants within the museum. 😊"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great exhibits. One of the best museums I've ever been to thanks to it's variety. Plenty to appeal to various age groups and even has some interactivity thrown in. Great to find connection with my ancestors.
Pay extra attention to the role of women in Singapore and history. They were the real backbone to it all."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Good place to visit and learn, take advantage  when there are special events and you get to have free admission at times! 🤓"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I personally am not a huge fan of museums and skip most of them but this one was absolutely fantastic. It wad very beautifully laid out with each room having it's own aesthetic theme and telling it's own theme.  If you're interested in learning about Singapore and how it came to be, then this is the place for you!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Excellent presentation of the history of Singapore. A must do to understand the city state. Nice touch that they make the entrance free to citizens. Everyone needs an understanding of the history of their homeland. The insistance on the multicultural and multiracial foundation of modern Singapore is inspiring in an age of rising intolerance, Even if we know the everyday reality can fall short of the ideal, it is important to keep our eyes on the aspiration."
National Museum of Singapore,5,"The place to be for the history of Singapore.  A guide gives you a very good overview and details are to read along the artifacts. Great to spend a whole day, if you like to."
National Museum of Singapore,4,It is nice place
National Museum of Singapore,5,"A great place. They even had what was named ‘Quiet Mondays’; As per what I understood, if you go there early morning on Mondays, your visit will be quiet and peaceful as there won’t be guided tours. The ‘Syonan’ exhibition (Japanese annexation of Singapore) is in my view… A must!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Really well as setup and I enjoyed very much the immersive experiences at each section. The walk to wall screens that wrap around you, the drive in cinematic exhibit with various cars to sit in, stepping into a HDB flat from the past ..... Amongst many more! Loved it!"
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place for family.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very child friendly with pram parking lots, lots of exhibits and activities for kids, understanding volunteers and staff, and big spacious (and clean) toilets! We also enjoyed the rotunda. It was fantastoc. Went with a fellow mom and we were 2 adults to 6 kids aged 3-11 and all enjoyed ourselves. I wish I could stay behind myself to check out more details of the other exhibits and the rich information. The museum's close to affordable eating places such as the food court across the street too."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great place to spend your day!!!
National Museum of Singapore,5,The glass rotunda is beautiful
National Museum of Singapore,5,Definitely recommend to any tourist of Singapore to visit this museum and get to know a little bit more on its history. There are free guided tours at 11am and 2pm (only need to buy the regular entry ticket)

National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place to visit.
National Museum of Singapore,5,We had a fun time watching the light show
National Museum of Singapore,5,Nice place to learn a out Singapore history
National Museum of Singapore,3,"The exhibitions were so so. I guess the natural exhibits of yesteryear were moved to the lee Kong chian natural history museum. Last week I was at the National Gallery. I think there has to be sharper distinction in the offering by national museum, national gallery and Asian civilisation. Not to mention the  art museum at St Joseph and the war museum at siloso and built chandu."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Beautiful
National Museum of Singapore,5,"This place is a must visit, .  this museum is well done, in a old colonial building.  Super high tech exhibitions with tons of detail and sensory stimulation."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Loved this place. Has alot of historical information about Singapore which as a Singaporean I didn't know
National Museum of Singapore,4,I love this place cause they're telling us bout Singapore's history. The ticket price for student is 10 sgd. Worth to try!
National Museum of Singapore,3,I visited this place when I came to Singapore the first time as a tourist. This museum covers the history of Singapore and it is very interesting to see all the places in its original form. It just shows how Singapore has come from a long long way. There is a nominal charge for entry but toally worth it.
National Museum of Singapore,5,A place to learn about history of singapore.. Good for young kids n family outing.. Also Good for tourists🙂👍
National Museum of Singapore,5,It' s a must to visit
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I had a great time at this gallery. I learned so much. Everything was very well laid out and organized and is air conditioned, a wonderful fun thing to do to escape the humidity"
National Museum of Singapore,4,"👍🏼 A good way to get to know the history of Singapore; artifacts, letters, replicas on display. Very thorough. I liked it.

👎🏼 The information displayed had a unusual small font size causing some difficulty, because my sight is not so well, when trying to read about the item being displayed."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Amazing exhibition of Singapore timeline. Free for singaooreans.
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great Museum to tell Singapores History
National Museum of Singapore,3,"The museum seems focused mainly on schools and towards locals. To be fair, we didn't explore it thoroughly. The building itself is worth a look at and the Fort Cannings Gardens behind it are well done and worth a walk around. If rating the whole area, it would get 4 stars."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Good place for learning history of Singapore
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Great place for kids to explore. Especially loved the Glass Rotary exhibition. I think it's a seasonal one, so go quick if you haven't seen it yet! Also, the kids I brought loved the Growing Up exhibit. The museum curator was fun, and actively engaged them in one of the interactive exhibits."
National Museum of Singapore,4,Cozy place
National Museum of Singapore,5,It always has an interesting line up of ancient artefacts.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Don't miss this great museum. If one think of museums as presentations of the past that serves to construct the current nation state, then this is a surprise. It is unusually factual and informative."
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Quieter side of Clarke Quay. Great service, very helpful staff. Prices are reasonable for the area. Only issue was that my meal was served to me about 10 mins before my wife got hers."
National Museum of Singapore,5,The national museum doesn't ever disappoint you. There's something for everyone. All exhibitions had free entry on national day and the kids enjoyed the entire experience ❤️
National Museum of Singapore,5,Went there to celebrate Children Festival. It was a worthwhile trip. All the kids enjoyed themselves so much that they want to bring back the exhibits😲😁Please have us back next year!!!
National Museum of Singapore,4,Came here as invited by my uncle who is a volunteer tour guide.  Is an eye opening experience to know the history of Singapore.  Sadly. majority of the people are tourists... Hope the locals to come and learn about the history and survival of Singapore.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Very nicely curated and gives visitors a good timeline view of Singapore, from pre-colonial times to modern Singapore. Could easily spend a day here if you are a history buff and enjoy exploring what the older Singapore was like."
National Museum of Singapore,5,Great place to visit.
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I initially thought that museums were old dusty places. Boy, am I in for a surprise! Visit Singapore's National Museum and you will be thrilled. :)"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"A tranquil cemetery park located in a private housing estate.   The park isn't big but is quite well-kept.

The place is not accessible by public transport.   Be prepared for a 5 to 10-min walk from the nearby bus-stop."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,"Quaint and tranquil little cemetery park nestled within a private housing district. Nice place for a stroll. There were several groups of domestic helpers there on a weekend afternoon. Unfortunately, some of them were a tad noisy, dancing to their loud music and breaking the tranquility of the place."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Although I don't know much about the history of this place but it was here since when I visited here as a young boy.
Today, after my lunch at one of the coffee shop nearby, I decided to go and take a look. I was surprised by the number of visitors coming here, and they were having a great time there taking pictures of themselves with the surroundings. The flowers are blooming, remind me of Sakura flowers blooming this time April 2021 in Japan."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Quiet Cemetery Park far from city side. Need to walk bit far from Kovan MRT station.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"Visited this cemetery park with a group of friends for a school project and we learned a lot about the history of the Japanese society and people here in Singapore before and after WW2. It's indeed a place filled with a whole collection of Japanese cultural and historical artefacts, buildings and tombstones. Also, very interesting experience to see groups of domestic helpers just laying a mat to picnic among the graves and tombstones amidst other groups of people recording videos and taking photos to post on Instagram. It makes you reflect a lot on the significance of such a place in Singapore right now."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"Over the years, other Japanese civilians were buried here, mostly during the pre-war years. The cemetery was a burial ground until 1947, and became a memorial park in 1987. The Japanese Association of Singapore oversees its upkeep."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Love it! Very tranquil and zen, never knew such a gem existed. Felt like I have been taken back to Japan."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,A small and peaceful little park that it's unique to it's origin! There's a small Japanese style temple in it and beside it there's a tiny zen garden too! Overall a beautiful park with some pretty sceneries!
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,A small quiet Japanese cemetery that contains many informative signages. It can be really beautiful when the bougainvillea blooms.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"Beautiful and serene park. Besides the famed bougainvillea, there is also a saga seed tree at a corner where one can pick up its distinctive red seeds. Apply mosquito repellent before visiting!"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Nice short stroll...
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"quiet, peaceful and a neighbourhood gem 👏"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Peaceful and beautiful place
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Looks dope from outside. But for everybody to take note.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Quiet place with flower arch :) seems like August is a good month to visit
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,Seems like pets are allowed.. just need to be considerate and remember to clean up the pets’ waste.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,A place to meditate whilst paying respect for the departed. Excellent location for photography. The venue is well. Maintained and its quiet. So many foliage and flowers which is constantly kept on point.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Well maintained with resident cat! Nice peace calm place for me after delivery ride with bicycle in neighborhood.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"Very beautiful Cemetery, kept very well and also nice for photo shoot!"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"The place is so full of history and really pretty! I came here for a school project and was so inspired by the place. It was really difficult to find the place and it was hot the day we went, but I think it was worth the long walk!"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Doesn't seem right to be reviewing a cemetery but I just wanted to say that there are some really adorable resident cats here! Most of them are more comfortable with the dead than the living though.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,"It's temporarily closed on Sundays and Public Holidays until further notice, with effect from 5 May. Hope this post saves people a wasted trip down!"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Very peaceful cemetery set a beautifully kept park. The Japanese Cemetery is a very respectful commemoration to the members of the Japanese community throughout the history in Singapore. Some information is in English, obviously graves and most other signs are in Japanese. Just go armed with a full phone battery to take pictures and Google the fascinating history."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Quiet, unique, and historical. Lived around this area for the last 20 years, and I like going to this park."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Nice peaceful beautiful flower and well maintained...
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,"Beautiful, clean and quiet place for photoshoot too."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,"27 June 21
... closed on SUNDAYS from 5 May 21 till further notice.."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,3,"Went on a warm Sunday late morning. Rather deserted. A trio and a dog, a pair of elderly, myself make up the entire population in the park.

Controversial place no less. A cemetery park with remains of our war enemies sitting on prime land while our own ancestors are sent far into mandai and Lim chu kang.

Controversy aside. This place lacks real Japanese design. Bougainvillea lines the arterial paths and stone slabs leads you into the tombstones. The main hall is closed. Could do with more informative reads though some are available.

A good place to get out of the noise."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Excellent place for photos :)
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Beautiful place though people doing instagram photoshoots ruin the atmosphere
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Its more like a garden than a cemetery to be really honest and you can see the planes fly by. (i was lucky)
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"This is probably the most beautiful cemetery in Singapore. It's quiet and quaint, flora and fauna are properly maintained. It also provides some information about the cemetery in English. The best place to take photograph is probably the pink flowers located at the shelter walkways. Definitely worth a trip down here. Do remember to keep your volume down to respect the dead."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Quiet peaceful place... has a small temple where one can sit down..beautiful with all the blooming flowers...
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Beautiful park with lots of history.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"The place is a bit hard to locate but not exceedingly so. It is also not a highly hyped spot unlike some other WWII related spots. During my visit with some other like minded photography enthusiasts, the only other people there were maintenance personnel. The place is very well maintained. Everything was neat and tidy, the lawns were well kept. The only sounds were those of birds and the winds rustling through the branches in a quiet afternoon. The place is not huge, so an hour or two should suffice."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,This cemetery has been around for more than a century.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,A quiet and serene spot hidden in an estate. Small Japanese stylings everywhere. Place well taken of by Japanese caretakers.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Interesting, quiet and not well known place in Singapore. I learnt a lot about the history of the country and the people burried there. There are lot of infos to read and they take a good care of the cemetery too. An interesting experience."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,1,Went for house viewing yesterday only to find this cemetery right beside. Its bizarre there is a cemetery in the middle of a housing estate...since when is a cemetery considered a 'park'!
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Quiet park with history
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Peaceful and beautiful place!
Don’t mind the “beware of dogs” sign, more like “beware of cute cats”, and a cat that will stare you down but actually completely harmless."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"Very peaceful cemetery park indeed. The walkway is slightly run down, but otherwise the place is well maintained. The place contains the rich heritage of Japanese culture that has been in Singapore since the pre-independence era. It is a wonderful place to visit to learn more about the first few Japanese who visited Singapore."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Interesting place. You'll learn a bit about the Japanese people living in Singapore during the olden days. There's nothing scary about the place, in fact quite peaceful and garden-like. It is quite a walk from the nearest bus stop and is hidden among the private houses. Be careful to walk on the correct road or you will have to make detours."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Not a sᴏᴜʟ in sight 😅
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Very quite place with beautiful bougainvilla arches that you can stroll through. Explanatory signs for historical points can be found as well as places to sit and reflect.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,2,"The place might be the most Japanese feel corner in any part of Singapore, as the tombstones and stuff are all following the Japanese standard. It is a rather controvertial place where it symbolize the Japan people’s advocating those criminals who did bad things during the war. I only visited it after I moved out the area for four five years."
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,A peaceful park where you can also learn about the history of Japanese presence in Singapore other than the war. Do respect the place as it is a cemetery.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"Very well maintained, draws a steady trickle of visitors. Most signage in Japanese so don't understand most if what i saw but it is peaceful and reverential"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Very serene and tranquil.  Peaceful afternoon walk
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Beautiful cemetery park. It's kept in great condition by Japanese school children as part of their education and respect for the dead.
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,Historical value
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Surprising hidden treasure in the midst of private housing. Well kept gardens and peaceful
The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,Nice clean place with some history attached.

The Japanese Cemetery Park,4,"(Translated by Google) There are tombs and monuments of those who died in Singapore from the early Meiji era to the postwar period.
The site is quite large, and the temples, Jizo, and flower arches are easy for Singaporeans to understand.
There are also explanations in Japanese in various places, and I am deeply moved when I visit the tomb of Futabatei Shimei and the monument of Yutaka Tani, also known as Harimao.
This is a facility that Japanese people working in Singapore should definitely visit.

The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"(Translated by Google) Before the war there was a Japanese settlement in Singapore. When she was still poor, many daughters crossed the sea as “Karayuki-san” to reduce their mouths. It was a time when it was a virtue to go out to the home for the home and feed parents and brothers. Even in the Kashiwakan, they worked hard and sent money to their hometown.
However, many daughters died of illness. I can't go home. Moreover, there is no one who crawls a widow who died from illness, and he was thrown into a hole like a garbage dump.
A monk who had it erected, built a hall here and made their graves. A small tombstone in the back of the cemetery is a sad footprint of Karayuki, who died in the hope of Noboru.

In addition, since becoming a cemetery, Japanese settlements and soldiers who died in the war were buried.

If you are Japanese as well as sightseeing and shopping, please visit here and join hands quietly.

戦前にシンガポールには日本人居留地がありました。まだ貧しかった時代、口減らしのために、多くの娘さんが「からゆきさん」として海を渡りました。家のために奉公に出て親や兄弟を養うことが美徳だった時代です。たとえ娼館であっても、彼女たちは一生懸命働き、故郷に送金しました。
しかし、多くの娘さんが、病気で亡くなりました。故郷に帰れず。しかも病気で死んだ娼婦の弔いをしてくれる人はなく、ゴミ捨て場のように穴に投げ込まれたそうです。
それを、不憫にお持ったお坊さんが、この地にお堂を建立して、彼女たちのお墓を作りました。墓地の奥にある小さな墓石は、望郷の思いで亡くなった、からゆきさんの悲しい足跡です。

また、墓地となってからは、居留地の日本人、戦争で亡くなった軍人さんも葬られました。

The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"(Translated by Google) Japanese cemeteries also exist in Singapore. Located at 825B, Chuang Hou Avenue, Serangoon. Not exactly a Japanese cemetery, but a Japanese cemetery park. In 1974, the government of Singapore issued a cemetery ban order, so it was applied for and approved as a cemetery park. The history of this cemetery began when Futaki Tagaro Jiro, who ran a barber shop, a rubber garden, and a general store, built a cemetery in a corner of his own rubber garden. There are 910 tombs in the park, and during the occupation of the Japanese, including Karayuki-san, and the Japanese army, many memorials were erected immediately after the war ended. Currently, the Japanese Association of Singapore is in charge of maintenance. The Japanese Cemetery Ceremony is held every year from 6:00 pm on March 14, and all attendees offer flowers and silent prayers. I have participated once, but the hard work of the predecessors made me feel thankful that we Japanese are now living in Singapore.

(Original)
シンガポールにも日本人墓地が存在しています。セラングーンのチュアン・ホウ・アベニュー825Bにあります。正確には日本人墓地ではなく、日本人墓地公園。1974年にシンガポール政府から墓地使用禁止命令が出たため、墓地公園として申請し、許可されたという経緯があります。この墓地の歴史は、娼館・ゴム園・雑貨商などを経営していた二木（ふたき）多賀次郎が、自己所有のゴム園の一角に墓地を作ったのが始まりです。公園内には910基の墓標があり、からゆきさんをはじめとする在留日本人、そして日本軍の占領中、終戦直後には多くの戦没者の慰霊碑が建立されました。現在は、シンガポール日本人会が、維持管理を行っています。毎年3月14日の午後6時から、日本人墓地慰霊祭が行われ、出席者全員による献花、黙祷が行われます。私も一度参加したことがありますが、先人の方々のご苦労があったからこそ、現在私たち日本人がシンガポールで生活できていることに感謝しなければならないという気持ちになりました。"
The Japanese Cemetery Park,5,"(Translated by Google) The Japanese Cemetery in Singapore has an idiosyncratic history that should be taken with respect. In 1891, three brothel owners jointly founded this cemetery as a burial place for Karayuki-san, women who earned their living with prostitution. Many of these women died poor and destitute.
Over the years, other Japanese were buried here too, especially in the pre-war period. The well-kept, 30,000 square meter cemetery park also contains the ashes of thousands of Japanese soldiers who were in the service of the Navy or who perished as aviators during the Second World War. But the remains of 135 Japanese people who were executed for war crimes in Changi Prison are also buried here.
Among the graves is also that of the chief warden of the Japanese expeditionary forces in the southern region, Hisaichi Terauchi. Due to serious illness, he could not surrender himself to Lord Mountbatten when he surrendered.
Tani Yutaka, known as Harimau or the tiger of Malaya, is one of the famous people who found their final resting place here. He worked as a secret agent for the Japanese military. He was later portrayed idealized in Japanese novels and films.
The complex was used as a burial site until 1947 and was elevated to a memorial park in 1987.
In the park there are also a number of Shinto priest sculptures and Buddhist sacred sculptures.
The tombstones in front of the steles, but also other shapes, only have Japanese characters.
The Friedhofpark is a gracefully contemplative place that blends in well with the surrounding residential area.

(Original)
Der Japanische Friedhof in Singapore hat eine eigenwillige Gründungsgeschichte, die man respektvoll zur Kenntnis nehmen sollte. 1891 gründeten drei Bordellbesitzer gemeinsam diesen Friedhof als Begräbnisstätte für Karayuki-san, das sind Frauen, die mit Prostitution ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienten. Viele dieser Frauen waren arm und mittellos gestorben.
Im Laufe der Jahre wurden dann auch andere Japaner hier begraben, insbesondere in der Vorkriegszeit. Der gepflegte, 30'000 qm grosse Friedhofpark enthält auch die Asche von tausenden japanischen Soldaten, die im Dienste der Marine standen oder als Flieger während des zweiten Weltkriegs umkamen. Doch auch die Überreste von 135 Japanern, die wegen Kriegsverbrechen im Changi-Gefängnis hingerichtet wurden, sind hier bestattet.
Unter den Gräbern findet sich auch das des Oberbefelshabers der Japanischen Expeditionskräfte in der südlichen Region, Hisaichi Terauchi. Infolge schwerer Krankheit konnte er bei der Kapitulation sich nicht selbst gegenüber Lord Mountbatten ergeben.
Zu den renomierten Personen die hier ihren letzte Ruhestätte fanden, ist auch Tani Yutaka, bekannt als Harimau oder der Tiger von Malaya. Er betätigte sich als Geheimagent für das japanische Militär. Später wurde er in japanischen Romanen und Filmen idealisiert dargestellt.
Bis 1947 wurde die Anlage als Begräbnisstätte genutzt und wurde 1987 zu einem Gedenkpark erhoben.
im Park sind auch eine Reihe Shinto-Priester-Skulpturen als auch buddhistisch-sakrale Skulpturen aufgestellt.
Die Grabsteine vorab Stelen, jedoch auch andere Formem, tragen ausschliesslich japanische Schriftzeichen.
Der Friedhofpark ist ein anmutig besinnlicher Ort, der sich im umgebenden Wohnviertel gut einfügt."

"Dalhousie Obelisk, a Singapore Landmark",3,"Saw this in March before the Singapore Shutdown. This monument was raised to mark the visit of James Andrew Broun-Ramsay. A colonial administrator in British India who rose to become Governor-General of India. This obelisk was raised by the Chinese and Malay citizens of Singapore to mark his visit in 1850, so it's called the Dalhousie Obelisk as he was also the 1st Marquess Dalhousie. Not a must see, but it’s a of a landmark in Boat Quay."

Lim Bo Seng Memorial,4,"Memorial of Lim Bo Seng who was one of the war heroes during the Japanese Occupation, one who sacrificed his life for others."
Lim Bo Seng Memorial,5,"Lim Bo Seng Memorial - A dedicated tribute to Lim Bo Seng, who died during the Japanese Occupation period in 1944. He was held captive by the Japanese Secret Police in Ipoh after a spy identified him as a member of the resistance army.

Designed by Ng Keng Siang, one of Singapore's pioneer local architects to graduate from London, the memorial occupies a site measuring 100 ft by 80 ft (30 m by 24 m), which was donated by the government.

The construction cost of $50,000 was funded by donations from the Chinese community. The memorial takes the form of a 3.6-metre-high octagonal pagoda made of bronze, concrete and marble. A bronze three-tier roof caps the pagoda, while four bronze lions stand guard at the base. Four bronze plaques placed around the pagoda give an account of Lim’s life in English, Chinese, Tamil and Jawi (Malay). On 28 December 2010, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was gazetted as a national monument.

In 1946, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial Committee, which included representatives from the Chinese Nationalist government, was established to raise funds for the construction of a public memorial dedicated to Lim. The colonial government rejected the committee’s proposal to build a memorial park around his grave, but granted permission for a memorial to be built at the Esplanade. The British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia at the time, Malcolm MacDonald, laid the foundation stone for the structure on 3 November 1953. The completed memorial was unveiled on 29 June 1954 by Charles Loewen, then commander-in-chief of the Far East Land Forces.

To note: After the war, Lim’s remains were disinterred from the jail in December 1945 and reburied in Singapore on 13 January 1946, on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir. In February 1946, the Chinese Nationalist government posthumously awarded him the rank of major-general."

Kranji War Memorial Landmark in Singapore,5,"Although not the most uplifting of places, I believe that we should all visit war cemeteries, to remind ourselves that our freedom is as a result of the sacrifices of others.

As you enter the cemetery you will see the Stone of Remembrance near the entrance to the Cross of Sacrifice, leading to a terrace with four memorials. The largest of these is the Singapore Memorial, engraved with the names of 25,000 soldiers and airmen.  This memorial looks like a plane with a star at the top of a single pylon.  It was unveiled in 1957 and overlooks the Johor straits where the Japanese first landed in Singapore.

The cemetery is beautifully maintained and is definitely worth a visit."

Kranji War Memorial Landmark in Singapore,5,"Kranji War Memorial, honours men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II. The Memorials, is made up of these three cemeteries: the Kranji War Cemetery, the Kranji Military Cemetery and the State Cemetery.

Kranji War Cemetery
Before World War II, Kranji was an ammunition dumping ground for the British military. It was not far from here, by the mouth of the Kranji River, that the Japanese Imperial Guards landed on 9 February 1942. The Kranji War Cemetery began as a small cemetery started by the prisoners, which was later endorsed by the Army Graves Service after the re-occupation of Singapore in 1946. The cemetery was designed by Colin St Clair Oakes, and built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Every year, on the Sunday closest to Remembrance Day on 11 November, a memorial service is held to pay tribute to those who gave their lives.

Kranji Military Cemetery
The Kranji Military Cemetery is predominantly a non-world war site that adjoins Kranji War Cemetery. The cemetery was built in 1975, when graves from the Pasir Panjang and Ulu Pandan cemeteries had to be relocated there. The Kranji Military Cemetery comprises 1,422 burials of servicemen and their families.

State Cemetery
The State Cemetery has two graves. Yusof bin Ishak, who served as Singapore's president from August 1965 to November 1970, and died on 23 November 1970, was buried here. Benjamin Henry Sheares, who succeeded Yusof bin Ishak as the second president of Singapore on 2 January 1971, was also buried here after he died on 12 May 1981."

Headstones of various people from UK, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, etc. who died defending Singapore & Malaysia against the Japanese forces are neatly laid out throughout the whole area.

The gentle rolling hills and manicured grounds provided a very serene and tranquil  environment for people paying respects and remembering these heroes.

Visit this memorial as early as 8am to avoid the heat of Singapore's weather and make sure you used bug spray and have bottled water to stay hydrated.

Located just south of Singapore Turf Club, the memorial is a 10 to 15 min walk from Kranji MRT Station. There will be signs at the station pointing you to the general direction and you may also hop on bus number 170 for a 5min ride to a stop outside the memorial.

Kranji War Memorial Landmark in Singapore,5,"Kranji War Cemetery, Singapore 🇸🇬 Kranji War Cemetery is the final resting place of over 4400 casualties of the Second World War, 850 of whom remain unidentified.
The cemetery also contains 64 First World War burials and commemorations, including special memorials to casualties known to have buried in civil cemeteries in Saigon and Singapore, but whose graves could not be located.
Within the cemetery stands the Singapore Memorial which bears the names of 24,000 casualties of the Commonwealth land and air forces who died during the campaigns in Malaya and Indonesia or in subsequent captivity but have no known grave.
Before 1939, the Kranji area was a military camp and at the time of Japanese invasion of Malaya, it was the site of a large ammunition magazine.
On 8 Feb 1942, the Japanese crossed the Johore Straits in strength, landing at the mouth of the Kranji River within two miles of the place where this cemetery now stands. During the next few days fierce fighting ensued, in many cases hand to hand, until their greatly superior numbers and air strength necessitated a withdrawal.
Behind the Singapore Memorial stands the Singapore Cremation Memorial, which commemorates almost 800 casualties, mostly of the Indian Forces, whose remains were cremated in accordance with their religious beliefs.

Keep going until you get to a crossroads intersection controlled by traffic lights. Cross over (turning neither left or right) and take the next left up a small road.

Area pemakaman ini sangat luas. kamu bisa mengexplore sejarah jika berada disini meski pun tidak ada pemandu khusus yang menemani kamu berkeliling area pemakaman"

The Cenotaph - a Singapore War Memorial Landmark,5,"Nice i love it..
The memorial was completed in 1922, and was unveiled on 31 March that year by the young Prince Edward of Wales, later King Edward VIII then Duke of Windsor, during his Asia-Pacific tour. During the unveiling ceremony, a chaplain blessed the Cenotaph with the words, ""The stone is well laid and truly laid to the Glory of God and the memory of the illustrious dead."" Against the backdrop of the sea then fronting Queen Elizabeth Walk, Governor Guillemard awarded medals of courage to those who had served in the war...
Thank you"

Designed by architect Denis Santry of Swan & McLaren, the Cenotaph was modelled after the 1920 Sir Edwin Lutyens Whitehall Cenotaph in London.

The Cenotaph was unveiled on 31 March 1922 by the Prince of Wales, who became King Edward VIII and later, Duke of Windsor.

On 28 December 2010, it was gazetted as a National Monument collectively with two other structures in Esplanade Park, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial and the Tan Kim Seng Fountain."

Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"Most beloved place for me in Singapore, it’s always pleasure to be there, beautiful artistic work with wonderful azan (prayer call) being there always soothes the heart and mind"
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"Among the famous masjids of Singapore is Sultan !

Sultan is located near the iconic Arab Street of singapore which is full of hustle and bustle till late night hours. In the area of food and commotion is the The Sultan, a place of peace and tranquillity.

Masjid sultan is a spacious, partially two storey mosque with an iconic dome and minaret architecture.

Masjid Sultan has a very high touristic appeal and hence is a must go for visitors and moreover the Arab street offers lip smacking food in the neighbourhood😇😋"
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"Beautiful masterpiece of a building, great scenery, good for a long walk around. And for anyone's that's trying to go all in, exploring all nearby attraction is worth every second. Maybe after a long shopping walk at bugis mall, bugis junction etc.

Just right in front of it is Bussorah street, a lot of Authentic Arabic restaurant and try to go a little early because it's always filled with people. Tried a few restaurant there, it's a little on a pricey side but still worth the taste, on average of 25$ per meals. And if you on a budget, there's a Malay Restaurant called Kampong Glam but still a decent place, and probably better than any other in Singapore.

If you go to the right crossing the Arab street, you'll find Haji Lane. Well for my muslim friends, it's not really ""Haji"" like as it called, because it's full of bars, place for people hanging out with friends and colleagues after a long day at work. But still worth checking out, beautiful place, the surrounding filled with colourful lighting, giving it a chilly vibes. Uusually there's buskers solo singing entertaining the customers, and you'll see a few talented musician too.

The North Bridge road just behind you'll find Indian muslim restaurant called Zam Zam which is quite famous in Singapore, should check it out too.

Along North Bridge Road, look out on your right for Kandahar Street. Once you turn in to the street, you will find the Malay Heritage Centre on your left. For those who want to learn more about Malay's history and culture, you may want to pay a visit to the centre.

P/S All photos was taken throughout 2020"
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,4,Get a chance to pray here. Very clam and nicely maintain mosque in the city.
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"Visited the mosque in 2017.  Located in the Arab town Its a beautiful walk through the town.  New custom I saw and appreciated here was that they read all of the musnoon after salah dua's out loud with the Imam after Magrib, Isha ...."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"A place of worship. All are welcome.

Fun fact: Did you know that the bottle-ends are used as decorations?

They are painted and placed under the main dome of the mosque. This was done to signify that everyone regardless of monetary status, regardless of their wealth or power, can actually contribute in the reconstruction of the mosque."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"Masya Allah. Does anything else need to be said about this mosque which has not already been done so? Masjid Sultan exudes a calmness I’ve not seen anywhere else in spite of the fact that it welcomes so many congregants and is located in the middle of a busy junction. To pray here is iconic, and to have the ability to perform your prayers is simply a blessing. Would recommend all Muslim brothers & sisters to at least perform solat here once.

In view of the SafeEntry measures, do note that the different zones have different entrances (some along North Bridge Rd, others along Bussorah St). Be mindful of these as it can be crowded along the streets in the day."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,It's really beautiful! Rich history over here
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"This mosque reminds me of Asma bint Alvi mosque in Muscat Oman which is also very beautiful with same orange dome and yellow theme. This one however has slightly different architecture but equally subtle green colour.
It's named after Sultan Hussein Shah who was the first sultan of Singapore. It was first built in 1824 when Sultan and his family moved and settled in next door. It was rebuilt 100 years later in 1928 in current shape and form due to original being just bricks and wood.

Currently its a national monument and very famous cultural landmark other than just a place of worship."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,The Sultan Mosque is gorgeous. The area surrounding the mosque is also quite interesting with many types of eateries. It’s a gorgeous day to be exploring this side of town on a clear blue sky.

However, there's an improper tiny lane called Haji Lane which is a place of drinking and it is full with people drinking at night. Mind your business at night."

Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,I can't adequately give this place a review bc I didn't get to go inside.  I visited in the wee hours of the morning.

Also near to arab street which is full of cafes and marvellous restaurants with tasty dishes 😍"
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,4,"One of the major landmarks of Kampong Glam, this mosque has been around since the turn of the 20th century. It appears to have been built in the Neo-Indo-Islamic style with some Malay influences, evident in the onion domes and facades respectively. Even though I visited back in early March (before the shutdown began), the building was closed to visitors because of the Covid outbreak. It’s still open to worshippers though. I'd love to come back and see the inside."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"One of the most unique and nicest mosque in Singapore. Plus point is that they allow tourists, regardless of race, religion or nationalities to enter the mosque and experience what it is like to be inside. Not only that, inside the mosque itself, there are a few exhibitions and informative that allows people to understand and learn more about the history of the mosque, as well as Islam as a religion.

Masjid Sultan is also located in a strategic location with countless of good restaurants and activities surrounding it. It is definitely one of the must visit landmarks for tourists. Even as a local, I am always mesmerised by it every time I visit the mosque."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,The most peaceful place i hve ever reached.
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"The Sultan Mosque is located at 3 Muscat Street, where it is the focal point of the historic Kampong Glam area. Also known as Masjid Sultan, it was named for Sultan Hussein Shah. The mosque was first built in 1824. However the original structure was demolished about a century later to make way for the current building, which was completed in 1932. The mosque holds great significance for the Muslim community and is considered the national mosque of Singapore. It was designated a national monument in 1975.

Standing on a site of 4,109 sq m, the mosque is oriented in the direction of Mecca instead of being aligned with the urban planning grid. The compound is enclosed by a boundary wall of cast-iron railings. Designed by Denis Santry of Swan & Maclaren, the architecture of the mosque is influenced by the Indo-Saracenic style.

The most striking features of the mosque are its two gold onion domes above the east and west facades, each topped by a crescent moon and star. The base of each dome is adorned with glass bottle ends that the sultan collected as donations from poor Muslims. He wanted all Muslims, not just wealthy ones, to contribute to the building of the mosque. The roof parapet is edged with merlon cresting. At each corner of the mosque are minarets with staircases leading up to calling towers with balconies.

The west facade of the mosque facing North Bridge Road is also the entrance to the mausoleum of Tunku Alam, who died in 1891 and whose remains lie in an honoured position beneath the dome. Two eight-storey minarets flank the east facade, where four Doric columns support the entrance foyer.

Within the mosque, the rectangular prayer hall is defined by 12 octagonal columns. Two storeys high and large enough to hold 5,000 worshippers, the central atrium of the hall is enclosed by a second-storey gallery. The mihrab, or pulpit, is framed by a lancet arch with gold-plated floral motifs, topped with a panel of calligraphy.

Separated from the mosque by a courtyard and an old bunga tanjung tree is the comparatively modern annexe. While its façade was designed to be similar to that of the main mosque, its interior houses more modern amenities. The building has a 425-seat auditorium equipped with simultaneous translation facilities, a 200-seat conference room and two multipurpose halls."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"One of the most inconic sites in Singapore. The mosque is more than 100 years old and is very well maintained. The hall can hold a congreation of more than 5 thousand worshippers. Surrounding the temple is Arab street where there are many colourful stalls which somewhat has Arabic or Middle East origins. The shops sells textiles, Middle East artifacts, Persian carpets and many middle East restaurants. Definitely not a place to be missed when stopping over to visit Singapore."
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,4,One iconic venue to go when in Singapore. Visitors need to adhere to regulations.
Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"A beautiful mosques in the middle of town, if you are non-muslim you still can visit it and come inside of mosque and you can learn about islam.

Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) Singapore,5,"The mosque was built in 1824 for Sultan Hussein Shah, the first sultan of Singapore. Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, gave S$3,000 to the construction of a single-storey building with a double-tiered roof.

A hundred years later, the old mosque was in desperate need of repair. The present mosque as you see it today was designed by Denis Santry from Swan and Maclaren, Singapore’s oldest architectural firm, and rebuilt in 1932.

A little-known fact about the mosque’s reconstruction—North Bridge Road was actually forced to bend around the mosque as it was extended beyond Arab Street.

Glass base

While you’re there, inspect the onion-shaped domes. Each dome base is decorated with glass bottle ends, donated by lower-income Muslims during its construction so that all Muslims, not just the rich, could contribute.

Gazetted as a national monument in 1975, the mosque has long been a focal point for the Muslim community. If you’re there during Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, check out the night market in the area and its many food stalls.

And do hop on the mosque’s informative guided tours—guides can speak English, Malay, Chinese, and even Japanese."

We talked about the state of Islam in our own countries and held the same interests in mind. During my trip in Singapore, I noticed the intense diversity of all people and religions and how everyone seemed to coexist nevertheless. I noted that point to the officer and he said to me ""we will all die and we all have our own beliefs, people make too much of a fuss about it, lets just live in peace"" or something along those lines.

Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"many times visit this temple. need to take off your shoes and put on rack but recommend to carry along with you to avoided be stolen (happened to my friends). before join the area need to remove all socks and walk around with your bare foot. casual find cooked food, yellow bread *not sure for name but all tasty. all non-tourist really friendly and love to advise you to make sure you can pay respect correctly. pagoda decorated by god/goddess which give you strong and peaceful vibe."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,It's very nice Mariamman temple in china town Singapore. Very spacious and looks good.
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"We visited this Sacred Temple which is situated on South Bridge Road in the heart of Chinatown. It is rather difficult to miss with its ornate tower and it's tall street wall with statues of cows and a lion on top. Before entering the Temple, visitors are asked to remove their shoes. On entering the Temple we were struck by the vibrant coloured pillars and floral hanging decorations.The ceiling has been painted with colourful religious images and figures. Small, colourful, and beautiful worth a visit."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,Ok singaporean checkinf
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"I really liked this temple, it was my first ever visit in hindu and I am very happy I went inside, its beautiful.
Dont forget you need to take your shoes of and be quiet.
There is the wow factor so dont skip it when in Singapore!"
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,Beautiful place that gives you serenity and tranquility. Remember to wear clothes with sleeves and longer pants so that you don’t show too much skin when you visit the temple. This is a show of respect to the religion. The visit is free.
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"One of the oldest temple and since the day I was born it had been here. Over the years I had continuously taken photographs of it. I had went in to see the interiors. It is classic like most Hindu Temple. Once every year, there will be a celebration with procession and the highlight is walking over the fire. I guess that really challenge the faith in the individual and their commitment to their faith. The same fire walking is also the highlight of Antony Robins's motivational course held in huge auditorium good for thousands of people."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,An interesting temple to visit both from a cultural and visual sense. Very active with prays and rituals happening at many different locations. Significant from a historical perspective being one of the oldest Singapore Hindu temples.
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,Great place to visit!
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,Historical place. Pity did not get to visit the temple but was honoured to be invited to attend a wedding blessing and dinner there.
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"Even on a rainy day is a nice,  cost effective way to enjoy some sights in Singapore.  I was surprised to see the tower which is vibrant in the cover photo has lightened and tarnished due to pollution,  sun and rain exposure.  Still a must see to walk by and look in."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,"Singapore’s oldest (1827's) Hindu temple is also one of the most popular temple to its proximity to Chinatown and its colorful exterior. Admission is free, though a donation is requested of those taking photographs. An annual fire-walking ceremony is held here every October or November."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"#SriMariammanTemple - Singapore : I love this temple, I got powerful and positive vibes here, very near to Chinatown MRT Station."

Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,"Im not familiar with their culture or religious beliefs i just found it interesting to visit because of those printed ceiling, very unique design of the temple. Other than that i would be giving it 5 stars if i know the story behind those relics over the temples entrance door"
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,3,"Visited the Sri Mariamman Temple back in March before the lockdown. This  Hindu Temple located on Temple street in the heart of Chinatown. The outside is fairly typical South Indian style temple with a gopuram. It wasn’t that busy when I visited, which gave me an opportunity to wander around and take a good look inside. There isn’t much to see and it’s less decorated than say the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in Little India."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,"One of the more relaxed place to visit. As a camera person, come in early hours for a nice backdrop of Singapore skyline. At noon, less opportunities to take great pictures.

They have a dress code here so don't wear shorts or dresses which exposes shoulders as they reserve the right to entry if the dress code isn't matching. Tbh I found them pretty relaxed but you don't want to go back from gate so."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,4,Very nice place for an exotic experience of a different region which may not be very popular in some of your cities. Beautiful decorations and special atmosphere with warm welcome by the religious. They may offer you free rice and food at dinner time. You may look apparently special if you're Asian or white among the other religious who are mostly Indians here. Good experience if you're very open-minded to engage in a difference culture.

Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,"*Why of late, Pongal falls on 15th of January every year, as against the usual 14th of January in the earlier years? *
••••••••••••••••••••••••

*Know a small Time calculation process*.

Normally, Makar Sankrant or Pongal Festival should fall on 14th of January every year. Most of us, since childhood, were observing it on 14th of January every year. Isn't it? In fact, from the year 1935 onwards, till 2007, Pongal was falling on 14th January only every year. (Prior to that, know that, from 1862 to 1934, it was falling on 13th of January every year.) But from 2008 onwards, Pongal has been falling on 15th of January every year. Till the Year 2080, it will fall on 15th of January only every year. From the year 2081 onwards, it will fall on 16th of January every year for the next 72 years, that is, till 2153.

*Why this happens?*

*As per the Indian Almanac Time calculation, Sun enters the Zodiac sign of Makara Raasi (from Dhanur Raasi), 20 Minutes late every year, as compared to the English time or the World Time. Thus, once in 3 years, Sun enters the Makar Raasi late by one hour. That means, in every cycle of 72 years, Sun enters Makar Raasi late by one day. Got it?*

(Also know that Indian Almanac Time is so accurate that our Pandits can accurately tell you today when exactly Solar or Lunar eclipse will take place after 5000 years. That also means that Universe works strictly as per precision timings which is why we can confidently calculate today when exactly will eclipse occur after 5000 years.)"

A selfie stick is a bonus here allowing better photos of the roof top atatues.
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,Nice decorated Hindu temple. Love it!
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,1,"I give this a 1 star for the guy whose in charge of storing your shoes. No shoes are allowed and you can't carry them either. I was wearing a longyi (Burmese men's clothing) that you can say is like a long skirt. The guy kept telling me I couldn't wear it inside, I'm a man I shouldn't be wearing it that's for women, etc etc. Although I was wearing it for me, he wouldn't budge in his stance so I removed my longyi.

I walk inside and I immediately see 2 Indian men shirtless wearing India's equivalent of Longyis and immediately felt disrespected. When I showed him the pictures of the men genuinely curious why I wasn't allowed but they were, he turned grabbed my shoes and plopped them on the desk.

Truthfully there isn't much to see at these temples. If you're not of the religion, then the temple just looks like a miniature action figure from the front."
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,Nice place as no castism no race all welcome here free food for all Sikh are great
Sri Mariamman Temple: Hindu Temple in Singapore,5,A lovely temple housing various deities other than the main deity Mariamman.  The temple is well maintained .Devotees can also buy prasadam at the counter.  The tamil month 'Aadi' (Mid July to Mid August) is a special month here and a large number of people come on the Fridays of this month for offering prayers.  Since it is situated in China town you can also get to experience what China town has to offer.  It is also conveniently located  since  the metro is just a walking distance ( about 6-7 minutes away).  If you are a practising Hindu do visit the temple for a good religious experience.

CHIJMES Singapore,5,"It is one of the historical places to visit specially for history buff people. My friends suggested that we come here at night because the place looks better with lights.
I loved everything about the place, you can dine in the bubble dome, lots other restaurants and bars, stroll around and of course take pictures.
Worth an hour travel to this beautiful site❤️"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Just a wonderful spot for a wander about .
A beautiful effort at ""mishing and mashing"" heritage building with modernisation.

With the current restrictions, it was quiet but definitely not short of people taking pictures about, appreciating the setting.

Nice 'bared down' boutique-ish cafes, and a lovely mix of flora.

Gorgeous."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Love love love! So much that came here 4 days in a row for dinner for different restaurants. The ambiance the food at every place I tried ( glasshouse, tapas wine bar, Anglo Indian & Coriander leaf ) all memorable. The place is so romantic & charming very insta - grammable!"

I tried explaining to the staff that I was confident the group of 4 before me were friends because I saw them chatting at the traffic light and heard one of them telling the rest to pretend not to know each other. Staff refused to believe me at all."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,This use to be the Convent of Holy Infant Jesus  premises but has since been restored to its historical glory with lots of eateries and pubs. An excellent place to chill and relax.  Nice 👌
CHIJMES Singapore,5,One of my favourites places in Singapore. Beautiful colonial vibes and Victorian architecture.

There’s some restaurants, bars/pubs, cafes and the Lawn area for chilling."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Came in March to visit the old church. This place used to be the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, but better known as the wedding scene from Crazy Rich Asians. The hall wasn’t actually open when I was there, but I don’t think it’s normally open to the public anyway. It’s a pretty looking Neo-Gothic church and the area still retains the Gothic architecture of the former grounds of the church, especially the cloisters. The area is no longer a church, having been turned into a food and beverage complex. Unless you’re a fan of the film or intend to eat there, I wouldn’t go out of the way to see this."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Fantastic place to visit at night. Lot's of food, drinks and places to take photos."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"We have visited in the evening, it was very colourful and nicely decorated with beautiful lightings. There are lot of restaurants available over there like Mexican, Korean, Indian etc... Must try place in Singapore"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Chijmes used to be the convent of the Holy Infant Jesus and therefore has a large history to it's existence.. but now the place is restored with many F&B restaurants, wineries and recreational areas.. There are eateries that serve japanese, chinese, indian, mexican cuisine and many other delicious food items..however all restaurants close by 10.30pm and the last order is taken around 10.00pm..there is a place for kids to play, so they too don't feel bored..The nearest Mrt stations are Bras Basah and City Hall mrt. The place is very busy during weekends and Friday nights and can take upto 20 mins to be seated in some restaurants.. A perfect place to bring your family and friends and even your date.. many Instagrammable photo spots are also available and definitely a place worth of going.. at the floors below, there is a spa and gym aswell. But overall, chijmes is a place for everyone...the ambiance and atmosphere is beyond amazing!! Much prettier at nights.. Will definitely return here to hang out and take more pictures ❤️"

CHIJMES Singapore,4,A good mix of dining options (quite a number of Japanese restaurants) including some nice cafes to hang out at. Toilets are also surprisingly clean!
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Chijmes with a silent J is a mouthful word to say unless you wanna spell and spread out the whole ""Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School Singapore"".

And with that gothic architecture and spire it can only be an European designed Catholic Church. Except it's not but it did used to be the nun run sister act girls school as well as orphanage where people would leave their unwanted infant girls for nuns to raise. Now this glittering, glamours shopping and dining complex is serving the community in much more modest way by providing a wedding venue and allows leaving only tips and good reviews behind.

It's still a national monument and heritage landmark though and very distinctive among all other modern buildings."

There is also a huge garden/lawn area in the middle of the courtyard with lots of comfy chairs and beanbags for a relaxed, casual experience.

I visited Paprika and Cumin Bar, ordered Big Fat Burger dan Colossal Burger. Personally didn't like the taste of meat inside the burger because of too much pepper and spices. But for the ambience, it is very nice."

CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful and Grand Place for a marriage or any private event! Wonderful restoration so much so that an old convent is now a hotspot for weddings for cocktails n drinks....they even have a drinking hole called Tipsy!! Urban legend has it that it is haunted (what do you expect from an old building). Supposedly by a Sister who probably was disappointed of the heavy drinking going on in the premises TODAY.... Second Urban legend has it that there is a secret tunnel from CHIJMES to St Joseph Institution where there could be rendezvous.....hm. Verdict: MUST COME AND VISIT!!!
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"@Giardino Pizza Bar & Grill at Chijmes.. seafood pizza and pasta really good.. grilled steak burger.. so juicy and nice!!

Visited again.. burger so good.."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,It was such a beautiful place with lots of things to do. Very picturisque. With wide variety of restaurants that caters different types of foods.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Nice, historic building complex with some grest restaurants and event spaces. It's a convenient location in the central part of the city, too. Definitely worth a look around. If it's your first time going there, I would try to arrive a bit early as it can sometimes be hard to find places there."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Historic Catholic Convent located within the city centre now turned into a popular night spot filled with restaurants and bars.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Much more eateries now than before, lots of choices, bad is one toilet and very far away"
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Very nice place for clubbing and chilling out except not cheap.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Nice place with lots of open space and string of restaurants & pubs.
Sunday afternoons are lazy fun with kids playing in the open spaces while parents drink and dine with friends .
Evenings on the other hand are very lively"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Nice place at night.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Excellent place with good food and good vibes if you have the budget. Highly recommended!
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Historical girls school and religious site changed into magnificent place of excellent dining experience, you have to come here to enjoy the atmosphere and ambience. Lots of good food and drinks here, definitely can find a place to suit you, unless you're those loner and prefers to stay home type."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Had a relaxing lunch gathering with friends...  It was a beautiful Saturday and I recommend to come here once a while to enjoy lunch in the natural environment...
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Love the square on top with all the restaurants!
CHIJMES Singapore,5,This is a must go place for couple
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Wonderful place to chill out.. very relaxing and perfect for everybody..
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"This is an absolute gem in the city. Love the place, tastefully designed.  Lots of restaurants in that square, you're spoilt for choice. There's a Michelin star Japanese restaurant  too.

We had lunch at Lei Garden.  They serve very delicate dim sum.
It was a good meal.

Walked from Bencoolen Street.
Truly enjoyed the walk with so much to see."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"In the midst of the city, tranquility.  Very good selection of restaurants and bars"
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Good place for #FOMO folk to chill at or take photos, and enjoy over-priced matcha <3"
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Full of heritage. Nice to visit for a cold beer but not when it’s hot and there’s no air conditioning.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"A wonderful place with the cheapest beers in chijmes. In case you're wondering where I am referring to, it's Anglo Chinese. Indian restaurant. I'm Chinese but this place is simply the best restaurant here.

I do not get paid for this review.

Here, the cheapest paulaner beers are served on tap at all day happy hour, and a good selection of authentic Indian food too."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Beautiful place, lot of restaurants woth plenty of western options. Great setting. Very pleasant"
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Not really a good place to get an early dinner. Almost all the placez were closed at 4pm. Some were not open until 5:30-6pm. We were going to get New Ubin but it wasn't open until 5:30 pm. Even if places were open, most of the seatings are outside and it can get very hot and humid in Singapore. I suggest coming here at night time. Maybe I'll give this another try when I'm in the area. I'm sure this place is beautiful at night time to enjoy a meal and light drinking."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Nice view, nice dinner place!"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Wonderful ambiance and very delicious food. Very friendly service offered. Loved the whole experience
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"It's always a struggle to ignore the very expatriate oriented feel of the place.
However, as their spending plummeted, the recent shift to tenant restaurants pandering to a less beer-garden stereotype (i.e. pseudo-Western food and supermarket beer at ""restaurant"" prices) makes the alcoves cosier and more welcoming.
The new spate of Asian cuisine places and a craft beer dive look positively inviting."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Very cute and nice eatery complex! Lots of coffee shops and restaurants, with nice park and surroundings!"
CHIJMES Singapore,3,Nice place for photoshoots. You can occasionally find some roaches in the toilet.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Almost Famous Craft Beer Bar is a must go! It's like the Apple store of craft beer bars, amazing experience and impressive decor!"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Good fun place to hang out with friends. But a lil pricey
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Former girl's school and church. Bar and restaurant inside. Good vibe. Worth visiting :)
CHIJMES Singapore,5,A place to dine and wine with huge variety to select from.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,A Great relax location for spending quality time with friends after work. Price is high but it's a nice environment.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Great place to go for dates
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Serving was really slow, and orders that came was half served. It is better you head to other outlet. the price for the meat etc was good. but getting slow serving of food your waste the time. We waited a few times for more than 10min to have our orders served. Supposedly to give 2stars but the meat was good."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Very good breakfast options and cool place for coffee ans hangout!
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Very nice place. A lot of food options, avoid Mexican food, pricey and no taste. Live music on Saturday nights if weather helps, also places just to seat and relax. Worth the trip, go and you will be surprised 😳"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Beautiful cosy space to go for date nights, lots of choices for bars and restaurants but prices will be equally expensive.

There are free seats and a new synthetic grass spot with bean bags and cabanas qnd nice lights for dates or friends to just chill and relax.

Definitely visit for sure! Feels out of this place!"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,A great place for some photography and food!
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Great gothic architecture. But rather sadden that the grounds that was once a holy place has been turned into a capitalist wonderland.... At the very least, let it be reused as a museum..."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Lunch business is returning.  Free parking from many restaurants.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Charming former school, the CHIJMES hall is popular for functions. They recently renovated, it's quite spacious and welcoming. It's super chill on weekday evenings."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful and relaxing place to chill on a rainy monsoon evening. We drank beer and ate Mexican food with friends. 😎
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"A great place for an evening of chillex with friends. Drink, chat unwind with friends while listening to live music in a historical venue. You'll love it."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,A wonderful place to chill. So many good cafes and restaurants to choose from.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Be sure to visit the Michelin star ramen place!
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Packed dinner from Anglo Indian; Michelin bib award winnee
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Little cozy space in the Centre of the city.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"I love coming here to read a book(although I wouldn’t suggest sitting under a tree if it rained in the last 2 hours) They have some really nice restaurants like Lei Garden and cafe like Glasshouse here. It’s a great place to relax, get some work done or just take some pictures.
It’s next to Raffles Mall (City Hall MRT Station which is also linked to the Esplanade MRT Station) and there’s usually parking unless there’s a wedding in the church."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,There are people vaping during work and I  find it very distracting and unprofessional as vaporisers are supposedly banned in Singapore since 2018 due to health concerns. Staff meal was average and could be improved.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,A great place to hang out with friends and loved ones. Great selection of food and bars that'll satisfy a wide range of preferences.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Good environment.
Many food establishment to choose from."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"A nice place to visit if you are bringing friends. But I find the place overly packed with eateries. Too close for comfort.

But overall still a nice place to chill. Wish there are more child friendly features for families. Currently, it seems it's more adult friendly."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"A rich mens' playground"", chimes is a compound of restaurants and bars located at the back of a Gothic church. It has sunken portion of dining open air concept, wide screen all around usually playing sports matches, and concerts performances using the church as a background stage. It has an overall great vibes but with mostly White or rich local patrons, the place is a no no for regular poor folks."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Massive church with expansive grounds, filled with cosy restaurants with outdoor garden seatings and some bars and a nice Japanese tea and desserts place called Hvala. Nice ambience in the evening. A lot of people got married in the church which is beautiful and also the setting for Crazy Rich Asian’s movie. There’s parking available at the basement, entrance from the front of the church."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Love it, but there is too many restaurant and cafes inside."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful lightings!
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Attended a wedding here. Beautiful place, romantic and elegant vibes. Perfect for that whimsical theme and insta-worthy shots. The only gripe is the audio system. Probably due to the high ceiling and the interior structure, there was so much echo that we couldn't hear the emcees, the wedding couple's speeches, etc. Quite a dampener to an otherwise lovely wedding venue."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Great place to go for drinks or dinner with a very nice atmosphere and enough options to find something you are craving.

During weekdays is a bit less busy and much more nicer to enjoy."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Lovely setting here. Lots of choices for food outlets. Went for a brunch and was not dissapointed. Has a nice vibe about the place and seems popular with the locals. A wonderful white church in the middle was a great photo opportunity too. The film setting for the wedding in 'crazy rich asians '. On two levels with easy access. It was a place i would go to again if in singapore.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Amazing place! I never thought Singapore had anything like this. This is really a heritage building and maintained beautifully. The stained glasses are really something. I attended a marketing event in the Chijmes Hall. There are a lot eateries there.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,No other place like this in Singapore. Heritage Building preserved remodelled into premier F & B location. Pictures tell you the story. A Must See on any itinerary here !
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Famous place with lots of good F&B businesses.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Beautiful.place with lots of restaurants.   Busy, buzzling chic place to hang out."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Had meal there it was poor quality and food not very nice at all.
The place has been renovated and a number of the best restaurants have either moved or closed down."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"No ample parking, no linkway to Raffles Place MRT. When it rains, you know what I mean."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful church with great restaurants and cafes. Recommended.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,What a beautiful historic tale.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,We pass by here coming from Plaza Singapura upto Suntec everytime we feel like walking at night. So many cozy bars to hang out here. Best part of this place is chilling out with friends without the noise pollution as compared to other bars in the city.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"A good place to have coffee, hanging out with friends.. atas poser hangout ..visual candy location."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Nice place, different types of cafe/ bars, enjoyable atmosphere. Good for both eat & drinks.
Be ready not all the places are opened during the day, better to visit after 17:00"
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"There is a lot of wonderful restaurants, bars, pubs, café to explore"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Let me share with you more about this beautiful place! Especially if you just want a place to chill or hang out with your friends and family then go for it. Full of flavour. There are also some bars in here too if that's what you're after. I didn't go to the bars here but they were popular. The bars look better at Clarke Quay though. I ate at a few resteraunts here and all were good. But I particularly recommend Carnivore, it's a Brazilian BBQ all you can eat buffet. The meats are delicious, and actually the salads are good too. You won't regret it. However, I only have one concern; I couldn't really find a direction guide over there and that is why it was a but difficult for me to find a restaurant or even washroom.Inside Chijmes are many different restaurants to chose from. Mexica, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Brazilian."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Nice food
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Great places for the evening dinning.
Limited parking space.
Mostly mid to high ended restaurant"
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"Nice place, but in between 3pm-5pm, the place is dead, 90% of the restaurants are closed for rest."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Love the place which I usually won't step Into this place as a busy mom.

Really enjoy this place as it is so pretty and take my breathe away.  A good TGIF to spend time at the area.

Make sure you explore and make bookings for the restaurants as mostly booked out by the time you are there.
Ate at ma maison for the tonkatsu pork cutlet and booked a dome to spend time with friends .  A chillax night for us."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Great building compound with a great selection of cuisines and restaurants
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Many overseas cusine restuarant...

CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Many choices for food and drinks here. If you like some interesting food and drinks, do drop by Anglo Indian there and look for Tasha."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,A must try in Singapore! Good court in the backyard of a beautiful old church.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,It's such a beautiful and romantic place to go visit and have a nice meal. The building it's in top condition well taken care of. Worth the visit.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,The place is really beautiful to take pictures and walk around but the restaurants and the eating places are quite expensive and not worth the deal at all. Unfortunately the church is still closed so one cannot go inside but a meditative walk around the compound is a good way to spend a half an hour.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Awesome place with great ambiance
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"CHIJMES is located right in the city centre, jus opposite Raffles City Shopping Centre. It’s the place to go to in the evening to chill out. Many restaurants, bistro & pubs. During the World Cup, there will be a big screen to live telecast the matches & fans gather here to support their teams. The colonial architect adds to the romantic vibes. It used to be an orphanage, then a girls’ Sch & now an entertainment area. There is a chapel available for rental for private functions. The movie ‘Crazy Rich Asian’, the wedding scene was filmed at this chapel. You don’t need to be rich but you still can experience the ‘richness’ of the historical culture here at CHIJMES!!"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"The place us so good to hang out at...

So many choices of restaurants.... and nice ambiance..."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,can’t get enough of this place. live
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful chapel and around chapel have other  spot for  photo ... if want to go there u must stop at city hall mrt and walk about 350 meter.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"For Crazy Rich Asian Fans, this was the location of Colin and Araminta's wedding. But even if you're not a fan, its still a beautiful structure nonetheless. If you happen to be wandering by, why not stop for a couple of selfies and explore the grounds a little?

Our full review is on Instagram (@monk3yseendo)"
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Natureland massage is great there. Always crowded so make sure you book.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Chimes is a historic building complex that used to be the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus and is well known where the wedding scene from Crazy Rich Asians took place in its church.

The former church has been restored and still retains its Gothic architecture of the former grounds of the church.

This is really beautiful and well worth a visit especially at night and a good place to chill and dine-in with friends as there are quite a few restaurants/bars options with most have outdoor seating."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Historical place with lots of great dining options. However, the number of male toilets is very limited."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Pronounced “chimes”, the name incorporates the initials of the original school and echoes its history as the site of a chapel and schools.

The original name proposed by the developer was The Cloisters, on account of the links with the chapel.

The CHIJMES was originally known as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ), which was a premier girls’ school established in 1854 by an order of the French Catholic nuns.

It was originally located within a self-contained city block bound by Victoria Street, Bras Basah Road, North Bridge Road and Stamford Road, and encompassed the English-language primary and secondary schools of CHIJ, a Chinese-medium school called St Nicholas Girls’ School, an orphanage, nuns’ quarters, and a chapel.

In 1983, the CHIJ schools relocated to their current premises at 626 and 628 Lorong 1, Toa Payoh respectively. The Victoria Street site was redeveloped and partially demolished to build the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) headquarters.

The remaining complex includes Caldwell House, the chapel now known as CHIJMES Hall, and the orphanage building, as well as a number of retail and food and beverage outlets. The complex was gazetted as a national monument on 26 October 1990."
CHIJMES Singapore,4,Nice environment. Many choices of restaurants and bars.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Beautiful Place.
CHIJMES Singapore,5,Great night life spot to hang out with friends or colleagues. Plenty of food choice with upscale selection.
CHIJMES Singapore,4,"With a wide plethora of dining and nightlife options, CHIJMES stands as a preserved cultural attraction that caters to the modernised Singapore.

Restaurants within this area can be pricey, but are largely reputed joints, such as Michelin Star restaurant, Lei Garden."
CHIJMES Singapore,3,"Beautiful building in the heart of Singapore. A converted convent, it features stunning stain glass windows on the main hall. At night, the hall is illuminated from the interior, making the windows truly glow from the outside. Stunning. Unfortunately, the restaurants here are not particularly great, and seem to be aimed squarely at tourists. Inflated pricing and sub par quality in some of the venues. I haven't tried all, so some may be okay. Worth just visiting to see the building, however."
CHIJMES Singapore,5,"Really well maintained and clean, feels like an out of singapore experience everytime I'm here. The bakery called dough has some really amazing breads"

CHIJMES Singapore,5,Very historical-photogenic place.  Recommended

During daytime everything is closed and some restaurants open. This place is a nightlife place which is a good location. It is worth visiting for both tourists and locan people.

During day time it's definitely a beautiful church while at night it's a beautiful drinking place with fancy lightings to liven up the place. Interesting concept showing the contrast of a church and turning it to a fun and leisure destination.
St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,5,I've been attending this church (Mandarin congregation) since late 2015. It's a beautiful church with interesting history behind it.
St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,5,"As an architecture designer and urban planner, one of my past time is to visit religious buildings, cities, and obscure buildings so as to expand my understanding of people's needs and learn from the past masters and also some mistakes perhaps other had made as I would not like to repeat them. Here is one cathedral that really impressed. The serenity and peace fill me whenever I stepped into the church. All other life challenges vanish in a single moment. I love to sit quietly watching and observing. Not really sure what I was seeing, perhaps just space out."
St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,5,"From outside I like this cathedral a lot. Special is  the green park location in between skyscrapers and nearby the MRT station ,  City Hall. I intend to pay another visit as soon as the renovation works are finished. In the meantime I visited the New Sanctuary with the chapel,  nice amphitheater and the café."

Sincerely hope it would be a cathedral relevant to all walks of lives even in 10, 50 or 100 years time (unlike some parts of the world). Seems to observe more older folks, elderlies around during the weekend as compared to children and young adults. SAC is exceptionally busy with walk in crowds, tourists during Easter and Christmas celebrations."
St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,5,"Was back here for my daughter's wedding on Oct 10, 2020 morning but under very strict restriction due to covid-19 safe distancing measures set by the church so as to comply with the government's ruling of gatherings for religious groups. We even had to comply to timing i.e. only 1 hour of solemnization, wearing of masks, and photo taking was only restricted to immediate and extended family only.
There was no buffet served after the wedding solemnization.
We were only allowed 100 pax and the rest we arranged for a Youtube live feed of the whole ceremony from the start. Fortunately, the government relaxed the rules so my husband was allowed to walk her down the aisle.
This to me was the most memorable part of a church wedding ceremony.
I'm really grateful for this really."

Interestingly, the St Andrew's Cathedral is not only both Singapore's largest cathedral and oldest Anglican house of worship, but also is gazetted as a national monument in 1973.

However, the restrooms have seen better days. Some of the cubicle doors are not working properly, just like some of the hand dryers, and sinks.

Huge waste of paper for registration, or to sign up anything in general, and even providing feedback."

St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,1,"We came here today at St. Andrew's Cathedral as part of our itinerary for our SG escapade with my parents and plans to hear mass since today is my mum's 67th birthday. When we are about to get inside the cathedral the lady approach and said that mass is a Chinese mass and we are not allowed to go inside. I ask the lady nicely is it alright if we just stay on the side just to observe the mass for a while since we are already in the cathedral and i dont know where is the other church nearby since we are just here for a short vacay but the lady didnt let us in. At that moment i felt discriminated, why is it that we are not allowed to come in since it is a catholic church. All Catholic Churches should open their church to public regardless on what the race or culture is since church means ""people"" and we are people who seek blessing from church.😢"

St Andrew’s Cathedral- Singapore Architecture Landmark,5,"(Translated by Google) St. Andrew’s Church, today this church was built in 1856 by Colonel Ronald MacPherson, an engineer of the Public Works Bureau at the time. He adopted the British Gothic architecture and replaced it in 1852. The chapel struck by lightning twice. The early building of the church was built with donations from Scottish merchants, so the church was named after the patron saint of Scotland, Saint Andrew. Those who participated in the construction of the church included some Indian prisoners and laborers who had received construction training. Before the fall of Singapore in 1942, this church was used as an emergency hospital during frequent air raids. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the church was reopened for worship. During the Japanese colonial period, John Leonard Wilson, the bishop of St. Andrew's Church, was accused of being a spy and was tortured and tortured by the Japanese. However, Bishop Wilson still forgave their crimes. After the war, he returned to England and was named Bishop of Birmingham in 1953 until 1969.

聖安德烈教堂，現今這座教堂建於 1856 年由當時的公共工程局的工程師隆納德·麥克佛遜上校 (Colonel Ronald MacPherson) 設計，他採用英國哥德式建築結構，取代在 1852 年兩次遭雷擊的禮拜堂。教堂建築早期建築由蘇格蘭商人捐資建成，因此該教堂以蘇格蘭的守護聖人聖安德烈命名。當年參與教堂建設的還包括一些接受過建築培訓的印度囚犯勞工。1942 年新加坡淪陷之前，這座教堂在頻繁的空襲期間被用作急救醫院。1945 年日軍投降之後，教堂才重新開放供教徒禮拜。日本殖民時期，當時聖安德烈教堂的主教約翰·李奧納·威爾遜因被指控為間諜而遭受到日本人的虐待與拷問。然而威爾遜主教依然饒恕他們的罪行，戰後他回到英國並於1953年被命名為伯明翰的主教直到1969年。"

Tapi pada umumnya wisatawan yang masuk ke dalam gereja untuk berdoa dan berswafoto, ada juga yang duduk istirahat. Dekat dengan coffee shop dan national gallery singapore.

The exhibits were interactive as it takes you through different characters' stories and visitors can use the wristbands to find out what character they can be.

The artifacts were in good condition and offer pleasurable photo ops.

Recommended for visiting!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The museum is rather small, but it has multiple sections and stories. I wish that the exhibits are swapped a little more often. Getting in is a bit confusing, it’s not via the bridge at the middle of the lotus ponds, but from the opposite of it. The staff are mostly older people but they are all nice."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star Wars exhibition is a unique experience. It is interactive and lots of photo options.  The museum is well maintained and very clean. Keep up the great work.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Visited the Starwars Identities exhibition. Overall had a pleasant experience at the museum.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,We avail to visit the Future World Exhibition in Art & Science Museum and its amazing. Both kids and adults can enjoy the place. There you'll experience being like in a magical world and outer space. Kids (and adults too) can make a piece of art and be projected in a large screen.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good place to chill & learn esp for children.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"The place is nice with clever projections of light and interactive displays. It is suitable for families with small children. However, there are very limited displays or exhibits to actually spend more time there."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A beautiful place to see Singapore skyline admist countless beautiful lotus flowers around. One has to be mindful of the weather. It's not sheltered. A good place to just get some open space and pleasant landscape to be in. An enjoyable time for me. 👌👍❣️😊
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Art and science museum often came with interesting exhibition to visit. Great for families.
This time we checked out the Star Wars Identities. A must visit if you're a fan!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Such pretty exhibits! Definitely worth coming
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went here on Friday evening to take advantage of the Family Friday offer.  We visited the Star Wars identities exhibition and had a great time.  We booked tickets online earlier that day for 19.30.  On arrival we had to check in and were sent to level three via a huge lift.  On level three we were given temperature checks and given clear instructions on safety.  It is refreshing to be somewhere where it is clear and precise.

The exhibition was fantastic.  Lots to see and read.  There are also many short videos to watch with sound pods above where you have to stand.  The sound isn’t great and you have to stand on a very specific spot, many of which were not very clear.  I think the spots just need renewing.

The interactive parts were fun for the children, although some were a little tricky for my six year old to understand the questions.

I really loved the art work, outfits, props and models.

We spent 1.5 hours here from 19.30-21.00 when it closed! I think we could’ve taken slightly longer but in my opinion, 1.5 hours was about right.

At the end there is a small gift shop.  Not a huge variety and I did expect a bit more, but some good posters, books and t-shirts.  The lady at the gift shop was very friendly and helpful.

I would highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan!  Don’t miss out as it is only in Singapore until June!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Nice place if you have kids, I wouldn't recommend adults only. Staff is nice and friendly. Overall experience is perfect, specially star wars"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,First time visiting this place.. Museum is nice n big. Star Wars was on display. Was awesome looking at all the wares... They also sell the souvenirs..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Went to ArtScience Museum on 4th of May (Star Wars Day) to visit Star Wars exhibition. Well kept museum just within MBS compound. Don't mind going again.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Visited Art & Science Museum Building on weekend and was very impressed with the interactive exhibition. Great place for kids and families to spend the weekend. Check in process was easy and smooth. My kids having a fun time there.  Nice place and nice building. An enjoyable time for us.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Not bad if you got complimentary entry.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always a pleasure to visit the ASM. We especially love the free movie screenings and special art exhibits here.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Museum space that constantly curates new exhibitions that are interesting and multimedia focused. Examples include the permanent teamLab art space, the past Disney animation display, and the current Star Wars Identity showcase.

Great museum cafe on the ground floor with panoramic views to Marina Bay. Colourful lotus pool that will certainly catch your attention.

The building is not huge, so don't expect expansive exhibitions!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"I love this place so much, we can enjoy a lot with our friends and family. I really want to go once again with my family to enjoy the nice views."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Sweetspot cafe is good spot to have some tea and coffee. Museum staffs are all super friendly. Thumb ups for the staffs. Star wars identities Exhibition were fun and engaging.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It's a beautiful place with multiple attractions at one location
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Went to check out the Star Wars: Identities exhibition. Rocked up when they open at 10am but there was already a queue. I didn’t mind because I had a feeling it won’t take long. I took about 30-40 minutes for the whole exhibition. It was good but of course if I didn’t use the SG rediscover vouchers I wouldn’t pay for it. Overall, still a nice time."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Nice place for kids. Thought it would be bigger but it is fine. Very nice museum to chill. Finished it in one hour!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World-Where arts meet science.

."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"First time visit. Nice layout, friendly event staff. They even provided complimentary tickets for a separate event. 👍🏻"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,I visited in December 2018. Exhibition MINIMALISM: SPACE. LIGHT. OBJECT was definitely worth visiting. 👍
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Cozy and quiet on a weekday noon.
Had a pleasant and quiet day here. Would recommend to come by to relax and visit an interesting exhibition or two."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A great experience at the interactive exhibition with artefacts from the Star Wars universe. It's a once in a lifetime experience as the exhibit is here for a limited time. For Star Wars fans a visit here is a must!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Went to the star wars exhibition and it's fantastic
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Basic LED light and projector to create the theme. but with limited content.
Good for children."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Really enjoyed the visit but only for kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Starwars!!!! For all starwars lover do make your booking of tickets online due to covid sales of tickets on site will be limited.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The StarWars exhibition is stunning
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great museum with great exhibitions
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Museum with a difference as it is interactive in the Future World exibits. Kids get to doodle & play exercise balls.
Both adults & kids will love this experience for a change."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"At the time that I visited, they were featuring Theo Jansen's Strandbeests which I'd always hear about and see videos of online. Amazing seeing it up close and it was presented in an interactive, fun way. The layout of the museum itself is very easy to navigate and there are signs, as well as helpful staff. Always a great time when visiting this place."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Interesting architecture. Nice and clean public attraction. Paid exhibits that are optional. Art Movie  screenings at specific hours. The current screening is rated M18. It is titled ""Horror, Expressionism and the Movie Image"" and will be on from 10 Oct to 6 Nov 2020. As we were with kids, we had to skip, even though it looks interesting! Why not give yourself a scare?"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing pictures! must seeing destinations in SG! great experience!

I love that place since Im a big art fan!  And i like to take a good looking pictures!  I always will recommend this place to my friends!

Dont forget to check it out the indoor place at marina bay sands. Somehow  most of my friends didnt do it!

You have a huge discount  if you are staying in Singapore so ask one of your local friends!

enjoy!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very beautiful exhibits with many instagram worthy backdrops. Highly recommend if you want to brighten up your instagram feed. Future World also displayed many interesting and interactive exhibits. Had an enjoyable experience there.

Would be back for new exhibitions.

(Some pictures are from the Magic of Animation exhibit which is no longer available)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"Not quite worth the price, felt it was a bit gimmicky. There were 6 exhibits or so, with some family areas where children can have fun, ie draw some pictures, scan them and they already in the digital art display on the wall."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"So beautiful! Never expected to be so nice, thought I will come out within 10 mins but spent more than 1 hour there. Recommended!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Digital Light Canvas : Futuristic exhibition.  Located at The Shoppes North Promenade B2.  Open daily 11am - 9pm.  Could be good if they allow visitors to use SRV for the entrance fees which is rather expensive at $13.30.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The Star Wars interactive exhibition was surprisingly engaging. Thought it would just showcase some artifacts but there was a full interactive storyline where you can choose your species and character and design it along the way (and choose to join the Sith Lord at the end- or not). Lots of concept art and fun facts you will learn about Star Wars’ early character development that even as fan I did not know (Yoda was inspired by the Dalai Lama?!?)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Had a great time at the Museum! Beyond the quality of the exhibition space (creativity of placement, ample ventilation), the staff on hand that day were young, motivated and loved their jobs. Yet, at the same time, oozed the professionalism the Sands group entities are known for.

Thank you!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing Museum! The place overall architectural design is great.The exhibit is a great chance to expose yourself to current technologies. You can interact with the various shows inside the room. Inside Future World is relatively dark so if you want to snap pictures, make sure that your camera are capable of capturing great photos in low light mode."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Highly recommend the Future World exhibit for young kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place to spend your time here. Star Wars exhibition is on and lots to explore.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Stunning architecture, amazing night scene"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"sw identities exhibition was average content n at da sametjme they get your survey result with elaborated stations for activity, ur personality survey. merchandise was one dimensional. it was raining at the end of d exhibitions there was no offer of assistance to cross back to the shoppes. this can be improved. and last part is using singapore rediscovery voucher, basically u hv limited time slots using that voucher. n then we paid for 245pm slots still queue formed at exhibition entrance. whats da point of timeslots then?"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Love this place, exhibits get changed and updated over time. This place doesn’t get boring. A good place to visit on a date or with family. Perfect for any weather! Conveniently located at Marina Bay Sands, easy to get to and visit with plenty of grand restaurants nearby. Pretty water lilies decorating the entrance to the musuem."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A must visit with kids. To see the octopus coloured by you swimming (on the digital screen) is something even adults will enjoy (I did). But more than anything combining arts with science &  transforming it digitally to behave just like real life is interesting.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Our first time visiting the arts science museum and really enjoyed two out of the three exhibitions, planet or plastic is fantastic and has a mas reliance to the area and the issue of single use plastic."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The Future World exhibition is great for families with babies and toddlers. Lots of interactive elements, even in COVID-19 times. And as it is with Marina Bay Sands, the family rooms and nursing rooms are 💯💯💯"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The Star Wars Identities exhibition is interactive and fun for my grandson and we love it..worth a visit to all star wars fan
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It's a wonderfully designed building structure that looks like an open palm. It was hard to imagine which finger the evelvator brought me to. I suppose it is meant to stretch our imagination since this fancy architecture is not like any other  conventional building.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very nice experience with lots of fanciful lighting and images.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful place to spend the whole day. Saw the plastics display there.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Somewhat expensive exhibition, good for fans."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great experiences here. They have a nice little cage on level 1. And they have free exhibits too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always have exciting events or exhibition. Went there for the star wars one. Was not disappointed. Friendly staff. Cool place.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very interesting way of educating the public on the detrimental effects of plastic waste and the importance of plastic recycling. Lots of pictures and videos to watch, there are some interactive stations which are nice too. Overall an eye opener to how much plastic the human population is consuming."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,An excellent mix of art and science at its very best.. Highly interactive and pleasing to the senses.. Amazingly awesome for all age groups especially for children.. We enjoyed a lot.. 💖👌
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Art meets Science. Fantastic exhibition to visit to find out more.
Interesting and well worth the visit for my very first time at this place.
Have areas to draw for all ages, and fun filled for the whole family"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Highly recommended to go to the Star Wars Identities exhibit. Outside the obvious Star Wars props, models and costumes, they did a great job incorporating technology and lessons on how people's identities are shaped."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"We only visit one exhibition, which is Future World: Where Art meets Science. It's a short visit with lots of pictures shot onto the walls and lots of images to take photo with. It's not as interesting as I thought so we are a bit disappointed but took quite a number of photos in the end."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very interactive and sufficient precautions in times. Exhibition is quite little and will take around 2h maximum for both exhibits (2219 Futures Imagined and Future World where Art Meets Science). The latter exhibit is more for camwhores and basic pics while the former is more thought provoking.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,very informative and cheap. learned a lot about dinosaur here ~!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Quite a beautiful structure, across several floors.  We were there for the Star Wars: Identities exhibition on the top floor.  There are lovely ponds and water lilies outside.

Park at the North carpark and take the lift to Level 1.  Btw, you can join the Sands Rewards Lifestyle programme for free, and a minimum spend of $50 will get yiu up to 3 hours’ free parking worth up to $12.50.  This is for Mondays to Thursdays."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great day out. The star wars exhibition is brilliant and the interaction great. Fascinating use of VR too. Great for all ages.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Uniquely designed museum with exhibitions focusing on the art in science, or the science in art"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice place to visit for the while family. Came here during Phase 2. MBS did well in maintaining social distancing. Sanitisers station in every corner.
Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Had so much fun here."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,My husband and I has a lovely time. We learned a lot in the plastic exhibit and had fun in the art meets science.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Its easily accessible as its part of Marina Bay Sands. Hands down, of one of the best Museum in Singapore. I went for the all access so that I can enjoy all the exhibition.
The Disney exhibition was surprisingly very interesting with all the interactive kiosk. So was the future world exhibit.
I wouldn’t mind paying again to visit this Museum in the future."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"went to the Future World with my family. price was acceptable. was not expecting much and honestly prepared to be disappointed, but the exhibits with lights amazed us and unknowingly we spent 2hrs there. staffs were polite and friendly. places were clean. but parking would be abit costly at mbs or far at marina square."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great museum with an interesting array of rotating exhibitions. Some exhibitions are much better than others, so consider this before getting the combination ticket. Tickets can easily bought on the day, as they have both automated and in person ticket purchasing options. Visited several times, and would recommend to tourists and locals alike."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great place for kids and adults.
Art is for everyone, every age.
A must to visit, my kids and I love it."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Kids friendly small size museum. Comfortable setting, friendly staffs. Park at the North Wing of the convention center for the convenience, stop by at the sweet spot for a red velvet cake if u need a bite."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went for Star Wars exhibition, was very interactive and engaging. Staff was very friendly, helpful and even gave us free tickets for another exhibition at the basement. Brochures were not only given to us, but explained by the staff too. Even at the end of the exhibition, in the retail area, the staff recommended us what we should get and what was 'limited release'."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good place for those who are IG Fanatics and would wanna shoot videos with lighting effects. Ticket price quite reasonable.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"This museum is so cool! Very photo worthy. Aesthetically pleasing for all the instagram lovers who wanna come for a good pic.
It’s art + science concepts combined but really just a pretty place in my opinion.
Lots of children and kids around.
Must see if in Singapore.
You can spend around an hour here."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World exhibition has numerous fun and interactive activities for visitors, ranging from colouring with crayons, playing with colourful balls and enjoying the scintillating crystal universe"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star Wars identity exhibit at Arts science museum was a blast. Very interactive and fun.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Nice place! Finished visiting in 30 minutes
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star Wars exhibition was very cool. My kids loved it. Wished it was longer with more exhibits and clips from the movies. Cheers
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,lovely place and interesting exhibits
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Slightly small but still adequate to display all exhibits. Scenery outside is beautiful and you can find some quiet corner for a break.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It was awesome. We enjoyed a lot. My son loved it.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice view....
Pictures 2017"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting mix of art and technology.. Great for kids! Architecture of building and landscaping outside are already  testimonies to the beautiful synergy of art and science.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"I think I expected more :-/
Thought it would be a few floors of awesomeness, but the experience really depends on what exhibitions are on at the time. Outside architecture is grander than inside."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A very unique experience for a museum. The sort of place you'd be happy to go to if you're not typically into museums. They always have interesting exhibits that do exactly what the name implies... find the intersection of art and science.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing😲🥰😍
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Lights exhibitions are pretty but however due to COVID, it seems like one cannot stay very long at one place you take photos as it will block the whole passage way. However, a great place for those with families and children as it has activities to help bond."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"It's a great for young kids and adults alike. Time well spent on a holiday, with so many interactive areas where kids can explore. The highlight was their interactive colouring area where you could colour in your sealife sheets/ vehicle sheets (sheets and crayons provided) , scan them on the scanner and watch them appear on the large screen in front of you.
The screening of the star wars movie is a great idea too, to relax after all the excitement of the interactive art space.
Their cafe could definitely do with more variety like sandwiches etc. But overall it is a great place to visit with the family."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"#2219 future imagined is an amazing exhibition at the ArtScience Museum in Marina Bay Sands.

They collaborated with artists, architect firms to imagine how Singapore will be like in 200 years. It’s terrifying and yet educational at the same time.

We signed up for the Marina Bay Sands rewards and got 2 for 1 pricing. Singapore citizens also get some discounts!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Future world exhibition is informational and fun for kids. The staffs are polite and safety measures well planned. Hand sanitizer is available at every common areas.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Such an amazing place for both adults and kids. I can see why this is situated here in the posh place of Singapore.

Easy access for prams and wheelchairs. Lifts are huge and easily accessible. For exhibitions you will need to leave your prams outside but it's for good reason.

The entire place is clean and the staff are all extremely helpful.

Superb place. I highly recommend it for all.
Amazing"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great place especially for kids.
Good place for adults as well."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great range of exhibitions. Currently running a Disney Animation one which is great! I would recommend starting with future worlds 2219 as we finished with this and left the museum on a bit of a down note. It was very interesting, an important message but it was quite depressing."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Fantastic museum with most helpful staff on hand to explain exhibitions - comfortable and spacious place!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Disney Animation exhibit was great, a lot of original hand sketches, colored drawings, and animation, was really impressed with the show.

Also saw the future world exhibit, it was pretty nice for the kids as well. Fun activities for kids to get some energy out while keeping them entertained."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A beautiful September morning scenery of Marina Bay while strolling pass the ArtScience Museum.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Worth visiting. Exhibitions marry technology and visual arts
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Love the exhibitions. Always something new to see and explore
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It is the best museum I had ever seen in Singapore. It is very wide and full of innovative design and content. This week is art and science exhibition and 2219 future world exhibition. Worth the ticket for enjoying the process.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Memorable visit.  A great variety of exhibitions.  Engaging for all ages.  The cafe was also a great pit stop for a busy day.  Will definitely sign up for emails on future events.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,For refreshing. I recommend this for you
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"When to the future world exhibit, pretty cool some are a little trippy. Overall cool experience, great for kids"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Incredible.  I loved it and didn't want to leave .  It purely blew my mind
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Beautiful place along Marina Bay Sands. Fantastic place for a date if your partner prefers a non outdoor activity for the day. I've always wanted to come visit the exibitions here despite passing by multiple times before and I'm glad I finally did! The Light exhibition is by far my favourite one as it's just so pretty. Photography is allowed but without flash. There are other galleries as well so do check em out via the MBS website. Lastly, because of Covid-19, you'll need to set the time in which you'll be arriving; this is to allow the venue to keep track of the amount of people to prevent overcrowding. Tickets are for an entire day so don't worry about duration. If you like this review, give a like and follow me to see others! :)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Depends on the exhibition, great for kids and couples to go on a date! Bring a sweater as it may get cold."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went to see the star wars identities exhibition. Amazing exhibits.
Located right in heart of the city at marina bay sands.
Must visit for everyone"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Highly entertaining and educational especially for kids 12 and below! The lights and sounds are spectacular! Will definitely come back.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The Art & Science Museum Building is quite unique and artistic. The location is amazing and the sights from outside and inside are both lovely. We had visited an Art show which was well Organized. The check in process was quite smooth and it was nice to walk around inside. The building is well designed and well ventilated. The cafe inside is also nice. The views of the museum from outside look amazing.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The exhibitions here are definitely worth your money and worth visiting during this covid period
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Wife suprises me and our boy to a Starwars event
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Should visit if you're a star wars fan.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Gd interactive place for kids below 12 yrs (bonding time with kids) & reasonable price for their tickets if u hv MBS card.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The exhibition is awesome. Definitely must go for star wars fans.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Visiting the Star Wars Identities exhibition at the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Not bad for to get some new interesting pictures and new knowledge of Disney history and the process of making the movies.
Place is clean and well organized. It's better if you come in the morning before place to crowded so, you can take great pictures freely.
My favorite is when art meets science. You can coloring the picture it depends the season and scan it.. voila your pictures is showing up on the screen.
I saw many children were having fun.
Place is easy to find just fine direction.. it's outside of the mall but, still you need entering the shopping center."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Went for Star Wars exhibition. 👍
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Beautiful decour, efficient entry (even during covid-19). Operating hours a little limited (last entry is at like 5.45, whole thing closes at 7pm). Best to do dinner after, not before."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Great for the kids, not so much for adults. Went  to the future worlds exhibition with my boyfriend. All the exhibits were innovative and different, but not much to do for us - only spent 15 minutes or so there."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Iconic building. If anything, at least come here to take pictures with the water lily. Good at night and in the day.

Take the lift for free to enjoy a short and. Nice view of the bay."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"I went for Star Wars Exhibition and it was amazing in terms of the arrangement.

Ticket purchased online didn't received email is one small flaw. But you can just mentioned your phone number or member card to redeem ticket at counter.

Queue at entrance is handled very well. Inside exhibition the slots and space is handle well too."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Fun place for kids to play and interact with the exhibits. Well crowd control and good time spent inside. Kids could play color balls that changes color as they spin, color and scan sea animals into the giant wall display. Color and scan cars to the giant wall to see them transported by alien spaceship to the roads. Definitely full of fun for children."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting and great place for families with kids.A very entertaining place as there's always fantastic exhibition going on.Almost every show is worth to watch.The museum is so artistic and very modern contemporary outlook.The lotus pond is very beautiful with varieties of fishes underneath.Nice for phototaking. There's a cafe in the museum to have a quick bites.The museum is surrounded with lots of branded boutique and restaurants.Nice place to chill with friends and families.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Different angle of ArtScience Musuem
🇸🇬
These amazing structure on tiny red dot
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Shape of a lotus .. beautiful architecture
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Exciting and thrilling, good fun for locals and tourist alike. Families with children will enjoy the museum.

The first photo, the maze of lights has been on feature for about two to three years, still amazes me."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I went here seeing Floating Utopias Exhibition this July, 2019. It is amazing. I saw a lot of installations that made of balloons. The history of this exhibition is marvelous and the flow of the exhibition is great. It's not that complicated to see the installations and understand it, but it gave me another unique experience, especially when I see the ""moon"" installation, it's so got me.

Overall, the building's so beautiful and the signage is crystal clear, you won't be lost there. And, there are a lot of staff who were really helpful and have a great anticipation to greet me first!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Went there for a Disney exhibition recently, nice and spacious place but enjoyment will of course depends heavily on the exhibition you are going for. Anyway it is near to Marina Bay sand and the area is also with nice walk path with sea view (popular place for joggers) plus some cafe and restaurants. A good place to go for a date."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,So much fun! The future works is targeted to kiss and half the size of the one in Tokyo but still getting my moneys worth of Instagram pics! 😂😂😂 Don't go alone and make sure you have a dependable camera man. Remember no Flash as well or else you'll run the experience for everyone. Also suggested to bring wardrobe changes.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"There was this exhibit where visitors were given a sea creature to color and then the scanned image instantly popped onto the huge screen of a virtual aquarium full of sea animals swimming.  I was entranced seeing my creation coming alive on the screen.  The message was powerful, we can work together to create a better world, one sea creature at a time.

It was wonderful to see kids engaged and interacting with exhibits. There was laughter and cheer all around.

So glad to see how a museum can  be exciting and fun so far from the traditional museum that I grew up with."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Really enjoy the Sweet Spot Cafe here !!!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"One of my absolute favorite museums. I hadn't been back for a while and appreciate that it now has the most stunning lavender colored water lilies in the vast pond around the entrance. While the space itself already thought provoking, the well curated exhibitions tend to have playful twists which makes it a superb ""play and learn"" destination for the whole family."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"This wonderful museum should be a standalone attraction somewhere far away in quiet area where you can give it the attention that it deserves. The current location maybe central and convenient but there are just way too many glamourous distractions around that make this educational venue bit out of place and less appealing.

The lotus flower shaped building itself is a work of art that is symbol of an open hand and each finger has a gallery showing its own exhibition. It's not only fascinating to look at but practically functional too. They have installed the cutting edge air conditioning technology under the floors to keep visitors cool in hot humid weather. They also store and reuse the rainwater for its kitchens/toilets so its environment friendly too. So basically you don't really have to be an art lover to love this place."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Visited this museum during our visit to Singapore and it did not disappoint. Iconic looking building from the outside and just as interesting on the inside with several exhibition rooms. I believe this changes according to each exhibitions times etc. (Might want to check out their website first)
We had a blast at the Alice in Wonderland exhibition and the interactive displays were excellent. Kids and I had so much fun.

Suitable to visit whether you are an adult or young child. Facilities are great, there are wheel chair accessible entrances and lift to go to all floors. Tickets can be purchased in advance online, or via self serve ticket machines or over the counter. You can choose between going to only one exhibition or visiting all the others too.

There is a cafe in the building but we did not try this."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A place for photography. Kids friendly.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,An excellent place for kids and very good exhibitions
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Stunner by the day and stunner by the night too. I did not go inside but marvelled at the beauty and the architecture of the museum. Quiet a happening place by the night yet so peaceful. Many eating options are available too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Before I visited this museum, I had seen ‘Bunker of  Lumieres’. I expect this exhibition would be as good as that. But this museum focused on the children and I was a bit disappointed. However children might love it."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Another great attraction in Singapore. The beauty is that it is not only a place to visit but also provides an indirect education to young people. It makes learning fun and with an interactive learning tools, it is stimulating even the youngest learners and ensuring that the knowledge stay inside them for a long time. 2219 - The Future exhibition is indeed mind boggling as it encourages people to think out of box and be creative while being aware of the current challenges that the population is facing; both in Singapore and also globally. ""Disney"" exhibition is really informative and interesting and it is not boring at all. Be early to come to this hall as the queue is already very long today (which is the first Saturday in 2020 and also just after school term started). Imagine the normal weekend after this and the next school holidays?? Definitely worth the visit to all tourists and also to all students and residents."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We loved the ArtScience museum and would definitely go back. They have 4 different exhibits that you can now go and visit but we went and saw the original one. You have to buy tickets for a session but once you're inside there is no time constraint. Take your time as it isn't huge, but definitely enjoyable if you take the time to participate in each exhibit. We felt like children playing around with interactive art, making our own fish and watching it pop up in the digital aquarium, playing hopscotch on a run that we created, exploring the light maze, interacting with butterflies on the wall and watching them float down at your touch! Heaps of fun and worth it if you are visiting."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star wars exhibition a arts and science museum
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"It's ok, especially nice with kids. Layout is interesting, needed to see once...no need to go back.
A true mixture of Art blended with Science."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star Wars exhibit was great!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Really enjoyed this. However if you visit do visit the current ongoing future and Disney exhibition. I had a lot more fun in those 2 parts than in the main museum.

The main museum had a lot of nice interactive ways to experience everything. Especially for kids this makes the museum feel like a full adventure. You can for example draw a car and scan it and have it then drive around on a huge animated city full of the creations from other people.

The future part looked at possibilities on how the future might play out and how Singapore would react. Highly interesting thoughts and underlined by nice exhibitions and realistic explanations

The Disney exhibition had a huge amount of concept art going through the full history of Disney and how it came to be what it is today"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very good for being children to visit.  There have three different The exhibition hall. Recently about Recent topics have been about Singapore's history and protecting the ocean and reducing the use of plastic.

There have change topics sometimes.  Very worth be there visit.  Recommend"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"ArtScience Museum was great experience. My most favorite activity was when uploading our drawing then we can see them life in big screen. It's a good place to entertain you and your kids.

The exhibit is a bit smaller than I expected, but still worth the price."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Future world is great fun for the kids and enough fun for adults
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Loads of fun!

Great exhibits :) Definitely worth spending a few hours exploring the Art Science museum.

We got to see the Alice in Wonderland exhibit which was appropriately psychedelic (and educational!)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great place to take photos. Instagrammable spot. The museum is a very nice place to relax and take photos. There is also a cafe inside the museum. The museum is in the shape of a lotus. The lotus pond outside the museum is very beautiful.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very good, fun place to visit. You can take great photos. It's a very kids friendly place, kids can have too much fun with the interactive boards"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went for their disney exhibition! It was an eye opening experience! We got to see works from decades ago and how the characters came about. Had lots of fun at the activity table too. The staffs were pretty helpful as well, despite the crowd. Would definitely go back again for the next exhibition! 🤪"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The star wars identifies exhibition was definitely a treat and well worth the price, offering more than you expect"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great museum, this place has several exhibition. I visited 2 exhibition, Future World : where art meets science and Disney : magic of animation. On Saturday, you can expected a lot of people, but not too crowded. You can buy the ticket on the spot but also on their website. On this building you can also buy gifts on the ground floor (the same floor with future world : where art meets science exhibition)."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place to spend time with the kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Shockingly very little science, but a fantastic way to spend a morning. Good to go there early to avoid the crowd. Best to do all 3 attractions. The Alice in wonderland was actually quite fun, though most of the “puzzles” were a little redundant. Otherwise, beautiful. Look out for the section on the main floor where you can draw something and have it projected on the screen."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A very nice building with great architectural features. Has a lot of interesting programmes too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,Too few people around. The cakes at Sweet Spot were too expensive. Imagine paying $9 for a thin slice of cake(only 3 choices) in order to get a soft serve with voucher. I'll ignore the vouchers next time!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"My kids love this museum, will go there again nother time"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We brought our young kids to the Art Science Museum and we thoroughly enjoyed the Future World Exhibit. They used light in creative and interactive ways to engage you. It was impressive and I believe it was stimulating for the kids. There is also a new Marvel Studios exhibit. It was fun but if you're not into Marvel, it may not appeal. It's a big plus as well that all of this inside such great architecture."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing place
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Star Wars Exhibition and there are some nice cafes around .
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place for kids to discover lighting effects show n have lots of fun.. too bad the slides is close..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Went here for their future world exhibition. I was satisfied with the exhibition since it’s interactive and well-provided. Though I would say it’s too short for a SGD 19 ticket price. But you can get more tickets to visit another exhibition.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting not-your-typical museum. Regularly hosts exhibitions of varying themes and content. Good place for dates with your S.O.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The exhibitions were great especially the Disney one
Plenty to see and do
Cafe a little expensive.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Definitely worth a visit"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"What a beautiful museum and such thought provoking and engaging exhibits.

We visited this museum on a rainy Sunday and really enjoyed all 3 exhibits that we visited. The Plastics one was probably my favourite as was the photography/Art one.

Really recommended and worth a visit!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"A very cool museum, there's lots to see and do in here! I enjoy the interactive art installations. You could easily spend a whole day here. There's plenty for children to get involved in too. I would say it is a little pricey, but it is worth it if you're looking for a whole day activity."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We went for FUTURE WORLD - WHERE ART MEETS SCIENCE.

5 stars for children and 3 stars for adults. I am awed by the presentation, the level of advanced smart technology and how interactive the setting was. The price was a little steep but it was worth it.

The place however is more like a child’s world. For an adult, it is like a scratch of curiosity. Nonetheless, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR A FAMILY OUTING."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It is a museum within the integrated resort of Marina Bay Sands.
The architecture is a reminiscent of a lotus flower.
The welcoming hand of Singapore with 10 extentions like fingers.
It is for future world where Art meets science."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Visited the star War exhibition but was disappointed
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Unique experience. Must visit at least once.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Attractions were super enjoyable. Reasonable prices and had many opportunities for pictures.

Went to the Future World exhibition and had a blast with my companions. Although, the exhibition was quite small and we finished in less than an hour.

Interesting concepts such as drawing and then scanning said drawing to showcase in front of others on a large screen. Very creative pieces overall and would definitely be back."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It's interesting, loved it."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Many nice exhibitions and just see the Star Wars Identities! Very nice!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"All the yeses for the ArtScience Museum. Caught three exhibits, namely, Floating Utopias, Wonderland, and the reason why I just had to go to the museum after work hours, Team Lab's Future World.

We had an hour and a half to explore before closing time but we could have stayed longer. We.played hopscotch,  went down a slide, played in a giant ball pit, and just marveled at the immersive exhibits. So worth the 30 dollars, and the trek, being so near the Marina."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Finally I got to visit the iconic white flower shaped building of Singapore, that is the ArtScience Museum. The exterior is beautifully designed with a large pond filled with lotus flowers. It is big inside, and not so obvious on the directions, but the tickets booth is at level B2.
I went to see the Future World and Alice in Wonderland exhibitions. Both are quite good. If you got on a weekend, I recommend to go early morning.
Note that the Aircon is cool/cold inside, so wear appropriately."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,One can always find something exciting here. Try coming on workdays to enjoy the crowdless exhibitions.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Most magical experience ever! 🔮
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,One of the best touristic attraction in Singapore.  It's at Marina bay and close to many other amazing attractions. Its impressive architecture is itself a big attraction. Inside there are many interesting exhibition to all ages. Enjoy!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Went for the star wars exhibition..was simple but cool
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Good place which displays art in way that you could have never thought before. It has different exhibits throughout the year, you can check the schedule before going. Friendly staff with easy and efficient ticketing options. Plus they have a cafe and a beautiful lily pond around. Must go."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"My first visit to Marina Bay Sands and AstScience Museum, and not disappointed! We were there mainly for the Richard Feynman's exhibition. Such a beautiful building."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The museum is in very good hand(s). Fantastic outing I had. Friendly staff. Intuitive. Hassle free. Located near MBS and Helix Bridge. Will definitely visit again.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Its a modern concept museum located in front of the MBS plaza. A lot of exhibitions, also a very instagramable place. Entry tickets cost around 18$"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful and unique museum nearby a lot of Singapore landmarks and attractions. Visited the Disney Animation exhibit they had and it was fantastic.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"A museum where art and science meet. There's exhibits that cover interactive creativity, futurism, disney animation, and more. I had an interesting time, but did not feel myself compelled to stay and meander for hours. The Singapore 2219 was intriguing, but not much more. Worth a visit as it's a unique museum, much more fun if visiting with others."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went Disney : Magic of Animation
SC bank card and Plus member got 15% off,
Lifestyle member card 1 for 1
All these information can check from Website.
Enjoy the Disney childhood =D"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"ArtScience Museum Marina Bay Sands which is inside a building with a very iconic architectural design in the form of a lotus flower.  This museum presents a blend of art, lighting and science attractions.  Inside are several games and galleries such as glowing balls, a room full of lights and interactive sensors that follow our motion, a drawing arena that can be scanned and then our images will appear on a super large screen, and the hallway  full of led lights that make us feel like in another world 😍"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Excellent venue! Iconic building. Interesting programs. It is part of the Marina Bay Sands. Can easily look for meals after the programs at the building next door. Very convenient when traveling with family like we did. Had a good program that suitable for my kid.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"It’s very busy. But well
Located. The exhibitions are changing we got to see a really fun light and playing installation. I’d suggest going there early in the day and often your ticket will also get you into whatever they have in the central atrium of the next door food court.  The views from outside are excellent as well."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great exhibitions and kids enjoyed it tremendously.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"We typically love the exhibitions at the ArtScience Museums. But my feedback is not about the exhibition which I just attended today (Virtual Realms: Videogames Transformed), but the management and implementation of the exhibition passes.

We purchased tickets online and included the Fast Pass. This feedback is about the Fast Pass. When we arrived, we were pretty surprised that there was no wristband given for the Fast Pass. The usher at the entrance explained that the FP is only for exhibits 1 and 4, which is okay, but when we went to those areas, we found that there was no separate queue for FP holders. So we have to go up to the staff in-charge and tell them that we have a FP, and then they will let us jump the queue. The problem is that whenever they did that, we felt like real a-holes as there was no clear explanation to other waiting folks that there's a Fast Pass lane / queue. We simply looked like we jumped the queue by asking the staff in-charge.

If ArtScience Museum wants to sell Fast Passes for exhibitions, then they better make it OBVIOUS to everyone that there's a Fast Pass. We ended up feeling like we paid for expedited experience but we were looked at by all other exhibition-goers like we were pariahs. We felt really bad for using the Fast Pass."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Had a disappointing experience at Synesthesia in Virtual Realms exhibition. Experience was supposed to be in groups of 4 each time (including combining different groups). When we reached our turn after waiting for 30 min, the group before us selfishly requested for an exclusive experience for just 2 of them, despite all other groups before joining into 4 pax so as to maximise capacity and make the queue shorter. This meant that after queuing for long, we needed to wait for an additional session to be over. Upon asking the staff what is the rule, they said each session can take 4 pax, but are willing to let the group of 2 do their exclusive session and make the rest of us wait. Staff should not accomodate such a selfish request and stand by their policy to have 4 pax capacity to ensure fair gameplay and waiting times.

Everything else in the exhibition was good, but ended off on a disappointing note. Hope the staff can improve on their communication to the visitors."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"This museum holds amazing exhibitions... always a great place to visit. Increase your knowledge and appreciation of the arts and technology. Naturally, it offers amazing opportunities to do some photography. Make it a point to visit, you’ll never regret it."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Impressive! Eye opening experience. Only managed to visit Future World only. It was fun and suitable for kids as well.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World - where art meets science

We arrived early this morning, before 11, and it was still relatively quiet. No line up for tickets and the exhibit was easy to navigate with our 2 young children.

The price for a family of 4 was reasonable, especially considering the 3D printing you get to do! Lifts/elevators were large and very fast. They are also centrally located so not looking for it in a corner somewhere.

Toilets were outside the exhibit before you go it. Clean and good size plus baby/family change room.

The bird flight exhibit caused us a bit of sea-sickness but we were easily able to escape. They have limited size groups which was great.

Our 2 children really enjoyed themselves. We could have stayed longer easily.

What we saw: moving waves, the bird flight, slide with moving art, a tunnel, colouring & 3D printing (scan your coloured work and watch for it on the wall in the moving city), a light/ball play area, hopscotch path designed by YOU, coloured squares to arrange that change colours, an interactive wall where you tough the shape at it becomes part a new wilderness scene.

Good for all ages if you like to have fun."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A great exhibition full of fun and knowledge, letting us know more about technology and being friendly to children. Will come again to explore more✨"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Love this place, very special place to combine Science and Art together. Got confused when first entering to the main level because we already have tickets purchased online. The staff standing close to the escalator ( think he's Security ) was friendly and helpful. I only visited When Art meets Science, lots sections are good for kids and family, but you could also have fun with the light effects, amazing actually."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went there for the Disney: Magic of Animation. Very cool. Many different characters from different movies and each section has very different styles. Some are more interactive than others. Some parts are more visual, others more for photo taking. Very fun!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It is one of the must go places in Singapore. This particular exhibit: the Future World is best for children. They have 2 interactive exhibit that the kids would surely love. The most breathtaking exhibit for me is the Crystal Galaxy, it really is a must see. It is like you're taken to another dimension."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing landmark around Marina Bay.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,My second time here at the ArtScience Museum. The future world is absolutely stunning..you can spend hours and hours inside and you won’t get bored.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"What a great place! So many new experiences for me. The first thing I admire is its architecture. It has a unique shape with a simple color and design. This place has so many attraction especially for kids. There are coloring and it could turn into a 3d moving object on the big screen, an interactive slide, colorful balls (a big ball), and for adults there is a good spot for capture a moment in the room full of lights and many more that involves visitor interactions."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Really love with this place, you will get amazed how they combine art and science and the most favorite from this place is crystal universe."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"After 10 years since it's inception, I finally got to set my feet here. Nice, clean, friendly staff, near the city. Accessibility is great via public transport. Just Google it. Looking forward to other interesting events!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It was very interesting and enjoying the arts at the art museum and Star wars exhibition. My husband was so exciting about Star wars exhibition.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It's an amazing place where you will immerse yourself into the world of Arts and Science. It's a must visit place with your kids. They love it. I was amazed when your crayon drawing gets converted into 3D art and gets displayed on the wall. The light and sound effects are top class.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,It is fun! So may colors and lighting. And it also turns to a relaxing museum! I really enjoy my time but didn have enough time to explore the other exhibition. They're have 3 different exhibition. Enjoy!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Designed as a symbolic gesture of welcome to guests from across the globe, the lotus-inspired ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands is the premier museum destination in Singapore for major international touring exhibitions from the most renowned collections in the world."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very educational.
A good places for both kids and adults."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Amazing museum that hosts various world-class exhibits! Very well organized spaces. It allows all levels of art enthusiasts to appreciate and breathe-in the beauty of the works of the artist.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Nice Museum to visit. Fun for childern and also adult.

2-3 hours spent here."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"It is kind of a more sophisticated kindergarten. Only the best""space"" room was for very adults - and an amazing sight."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Disney animation was underwhelming. Art meets Science exhibition was fun and interactive for kids. Best suited for kids aged between 4-10yrs old.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great place if you are an any kind of art lover
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Some very cool exhibits and displays. I particularly enjoyed the minimalist and the Richard Feynman exhibits. The architecture of the museum itself was a plus especially in the minimalist exhibit.

There are lots of spaces and activities for children, so it's great for families.

The line to buy tickets was pretty long and though it moved consistently it was still pretty slow. I went ahead and bought my tickets online which made entry into all exhibits super smooth with a QR code on my phone.

The whole museum is fairly minimalist itself. There is a nice walkway outside near the lily pad garden. Not much to speak of in the way of a cafe and of course the obligatory gift store is there although it's sort of spread out rather than in one spot.

The elevators are slow and in demand, but are necessary to get to the upper floors. It would have been nice to have stairs or additional escalators. It felt like I spent a lot of time waiting for elevators.

Would definitely recommend a visit if you like museums. It's small and easy to see everything in a couple of hours."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Awesome place, super interactive for kids!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Nice building to look at from the outside. Recommend not going in.

Re: the Future World exhibit
1. There were “17” different things to see, the first 16 were extremely basic in terms of technology, and felt uninspired. In reality there were only 7 truly distinct things to see, two being variants of the same thing (Sketch Town and Aquarium: Colouring in an outline of a drawing - scanning these images such that they could be projected into a screen was as advanced as the ‘science’ gets here). The Crystal Universe was a cool concept and were it much larger would’ve been a positive experience.
2. Exhibition smells strongly like nail polish.
3. The space would have to be exceptional to justify the $19 entry fee. It was laughable.

There were also only 2 exhibits in the museum.
The Into The Wild screening was free but there was nothing to it.

Recommended only to those who are not yet aware of man’s ability to project light onto surfaces."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Really interesting exhibits.  From kid friendly interactive to abstract and minimalist there are exhibits to keep you occupied and make you think a bit too.  On the top level they have free art movies.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Very beautiful, and very interesting exhibit. Would have preferred if there was more installations but overall it was a great experience. Highly recommend to bring your student ID if you have one."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"It's a modern museum. Located just outside the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall, that lotus flower shaped building.  It's a bit boring for the kids. My kids only loved the section where they sketched and made drawings and then scanned up and saw them come alive on the projector."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice place for adult and children, want to be back there again. I spent sooo much time in Future World"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Visiting with my family at art and science exhibition. Using Friday as family day (free for kids below 6 y.o) we had so much fun. Really good atmosphere, clean, and artsy feel in every corner."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Unique museum. Your kids will love it
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It's quite an experience, a visual one. Most rooms are connected by dark corridors and light seeps through curtains that separated the room from the corridors. The room is bright, colorful and mesmerizing. Light is the main attraction of Art Science Museum of Singapore, if don't have any light sensitive conditions, this is a place to go."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"One of the most beautiful and inspiring places I have ever been . Plan on spending at least half a day there . Beautiful art peaceful environment amazing interactive inspiring art . I loved it . I would highly
Recommend ."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I'm not a fan of museums but I loved every exhibit here since it opened. There's always something new to learn in the Art Science Museum. Perfect for people with no background or interest in history or conventional art / photography. Examples of exhibits (with consistently extensive explanations provided) are: Harry Potter movie props, the making and background story of characters in the Avengers, windwalkers (an invention to redistribute sand and slow coastal erosion), and interactive digital light displays. You won't regret going for sure!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always a fun experience despite repeated visits. Looking forward to many more exhibits in the future.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Dont go during holidays time. It got super long queue! Great exhibition though
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Interesting place, I defineyely recommend visiting the ""Disney experience""! We've been growing up with all their movies and it was great going back to those times, being children :) there was also a lot of information about the drawing technics and animation evolution. As for the ""Future world"", it was good as well, although it would have been better, if it was mentioned somewhere that its mostly for children - playing with toys, drawing and running around :)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Is one of the worst museums I've ever been. The expositions are really boring (it's a very mediocre art mixed with some technology).

People go there just because one site is very instagrammable.

Prices are very high for such a poor museum.

The only thing worth is the architecture which you can see from outside.

There are better places to waste your money"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing museum! They offer various exhibitions. If you bring kids, they will love it. When we went there (January 11th 2019), there was Disney Animations, and Future World which definitely combine the art with the future!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"We’ve been to future world for the famous spot on instagram.
Last part of the museum with the led lights was amazing!
19 SGD per person.
I thought it will be more interactive!
Kids have more fun"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Visited for the disney exhibition show. Was very pleasant and enjoyable. Prices are different depending if you're resident or not, also buying a bundle of multiple exhibition ticket is cheaper then buying singles. I suggest you sign up for membership. I bought the ticket for the next day because I can late and the ticket was sold out. I recommend coming earlier for secure entry."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It is so beautiful and we went on the bout
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The lines may be long but it's actually handled properly by the people. It won't take too long for you to queue.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great place for all to interact with the arts. Visited the much hyped exhibition by team lab from Japan and I had a great time there. The interactive displays made if possible for everyone to immerse themselves in art and it was heartwarming to see both old and young enjoying the elements in different ways.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Pretty overrated, the exhibits are small and not really worth the time or price. However, they are still interesting, especially the light one."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing museum. A must visit. Really have lots of fun here. Sometimes it has unique exhibition. Now it has Windwalker & Marvel exhibition. There's a special offer from Marina Bay Sands. Just go there to make a free annual membership by showing passport, then u can use the card to get a B1G1 free ticket at Art Science Museum"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very interesting and interactive
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Visit Art meet Science with digital effects, animation, light sensory and art interactions."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Went on a weekday and it was (I would assume) alot less crowded. No queue for slides and there were seats for your little one to showcase their artistic talents on the big screen. The museum area isn't big and would strongly suggest a kill time of 2-3hrs for kids and probably 30mins for teenagers / couples..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Its a fun place for both young and adults. Entrance ticket is a bit costly. I enjoyed taking the slide along the fruit trail ( even though I'm an adult 😁). Colouring with crayons was an exciting activity and we could scan these coloured pictures and it would appear on the computerized displays.We also got to see a short animated movie on fourth floor about saving forest and its animal. The place was little too dark for good photos and selfies but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Overall, a must-see tourist attraction site."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Go early as there are no time limit
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The exhibition minimalism was an excellent display of soud, light and objects.  No long queues, and even when really busy, enough space to view everything leisurely.  Combined with two other displays of future worlds (great for kids in particular) and the educational All Possible Paths, this exhibition will take roughly 2.5 hrs to make your way through.  Free entry into the national gallery with your ticket."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,From the outside it looks really epic! It has become one of the building I identify Singapore with. The inside is also nice and offers different exhibitions. I was in a modern art exhibition and enjoyed it quite a lot. You should have around 2 hours planned if you want to make the most of it even better 3 hours.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Mesmerising place with many attractions suited for kids. Bean bags are gone due to Covid.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Nice place to visit on a weekend especially when u have kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,I loved the place specifically  the moon area but it could be better what I have expected  earlier but though I have learned  lot things from this museum structures are good
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very interactive exhibits. Informative and easy to navigate. Easily acvessible via public transport and MRT. Interesting & Exciting!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,It’s nearby gardens by bay & Louis vitton building. Good visit for children. Amazing places nearby marina bay sands. U can walk & see all the tourists spots in a day.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Really nice museum with loads of exhibits. Highly recommend buying tickets online beforehand for the various exhibitions because the ticket lobby gets incredibly crowded.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Usually interesting interactive exhibits ongoing here. Futuristic facade as well
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It was treat for children.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,~My friend and I won tickets to the Floating Utopias exhibition on Insta. That's what made us visit the Art Science Museum at Marina Bay haha. It was worth it though!! The exhibition was enjoyable and even the museum was nice :)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,It was a fun and interesting place to spend a half day. There were activities that kept kids and adults likewise smiling and laughing and there were some real nice techy art that was rather amazing to look at. The light room was nice of course.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,They're having a Disney exhibition right now and it's truly magical and incredible! A must for all disney fans
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Easy to access despite Covid period. Went during off peak weekday which was just nice to enjoy the exhibitions
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Visited the museum for the Future World exhibition at B2. Good management of crowd and hygiene at the various touch-points and more suited for families with kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Need a good camera to bring to here as it's so dark inside. But it's so fascinating me as i really like all stuff about technology and also there's few activity could be done here. Maybe i will be back to experience other theme
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing!! A must see, especially if you have kids or are a big kid yourself. The exhibits change but there is always something interesting going on. Definitely worth spending the day here and then grabbing dinner nearby at the malls many food offerings in the food court."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place to visit in Singapore. Really liked the interactive activities put on for the kids. Our children loved it! I also appreciated the art exhibitions on display.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The Starwars Identities was excellent, even on a second visit.  The psychological study of how Anakin and Luke turn out is just fascinating. So much of this can be applied to ourselves and our identity."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Enjoyed the exhibit at the time. It’s near the mall and other tourist spots too so you can roam around after geeking inside.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,My son enjoy it
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Science combined with art inside the museum. Many interactive games inside the Future World and kids really love it. There is a cafe on Level 1/ Lobby floor and more galleries on upper floors. The most amazing thing during my visit was that you can draw a designated subject such as a bus or a fish, then scan your scratched drawing, then your object inside your drawing will appear on the big screen. Your drawing will move around and you can interact with them by touching it (touch the screen). I really recommend to bring your kids here (in order to understand what the future might appears)."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It is a nice place to take photos. Now with safe distancing it is actually easier to get pictures without people in it, especially on weekdays. Most of the exhibits are interactive too so it will interest the kids."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Saw the Star wars Identities there. Location is excellent and everything went smoothly.
Waiting times were a little long and they could have staggered the starting times a little more granular"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"A very beautiful building with a lovely view of the bay and surrounding areas! The exhibition's are a nice size, but not hugely interactive and sometimes slightly boring. I attended the Sandwalkers and Marvel exhibitions, of which Marvel was definitely the more interesting!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice program for the entire family. thede are multiple exhibitions. The wonderworld exhibition was not too big deal, but the future world exhibition was very interesting. There is a very nice cafe with salad bar at the entrance. There is a science reading corner also available for kids."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I'm loving every experience I get in this place! Such a fun and child-friendly place, with a lot of art meets science experience that childrens can take inside. It's easy to get here, because the building isn't hard to find while at the same time it's beautiful too. In my opinion, it's also worth the price, considering the uniqueness and what you'll experience inside."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,This is where the Art meet Science inside a museum that called The Art Science Museum... Pretty cool to see the art in science way or science with the art sense of view...
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A wonderful place to take your kids to play. Kids learn and play with various kinds of interactive equipments. The entrance fees are affordable and really worth the money spent. You can entirely experience a different kind of interactive activities in here.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Really amazing blend of art and science.  Very kid friendly and educational with a fun twist
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great layout of an amazingly designed building. Well 2 in one that i recently learnt. Attend the for Disney Magic of Animation Exhibition and Future World where art meets science. Wasn't to busy so it was quite enjoyable. Would recommend both for families also.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good place to visit. Honestly pay for the future and minimalist. Children friendly and as an adult was a blast for me. Worth it... around 1-2 hours i spend in those 2 expositions.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Most exhibitions are for families with kids. I enjoyed the 2219 exhibition exploring the future of Singapore in times of climate change. Tickets can be bought with card and cash in the basement.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place for kids and families! Great views of Singapore
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It was a beautiful experience. Full of wonder! No matter what age you are in, you will be mesmerized by it. The experience itself didn't necessarily have any newer attractions, but will still be in awe by them. I went here in October 2018, and it was pretty crowded."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Excellent place to learn Singapore history. Have a wide collection of antiques and artifacts, like a time machine that takes you back to the old time."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Absolutely state of the art facility! Exhibits are beyond what I imagine! 100% worth visiting!!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Detailed introduction by visitor information counter staff. Annual pass of $150 only for future World exhibition. Can plan for annual pass of $300 to all exhibition whole year round for all the exhibitions and have member events to imptove membership take up rate. For Singaporeans and Foreigners alike.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Sorely disappointed on our first visit to the future world exhibition. Visited on a Sunday afternoon and obviously it was a kids galore (think: more than a dozen of screaming rowdy kids).

Exhibits were mildly interesting but lacked the intriguing factors.. you get to the end of the exhibition before you know it and be wondering how did all these justify the price.

Don’t waste on your time and money. You would be better off at national gallery of Singapore or the national museum for more enthralling, quality stuff."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"When I visited they had three different constellations, and I payed S$38 to see all of them. In retrospective, I only appreciated one of them, the street arts one. The dead animal display was quite boring. The future world had one nice thing, rest was more for children to play. Your experience may vary."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A lot of fun stuff can be done here.
Recommended for most of families and someone who wants to get some nice picture back.
Worth for the entrance fees."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,One of the best science museums on earth..I especially liked their future world exhibition and seen it twice.. Highly recommended..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,amazing place when art meets science
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Educational, art inspired, museum. Loce the lotus pond too. Good job!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Really well integration of Art & Science. Good for family & kids. Good for IG lover as well. Worth to go!!!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"My most favourite place in Marina bay sands, it has sections and each section has different art gallery. Any one can choose whichever section they wanna see and pay for that. I had seen some amazing art work in that, I am sharing some pictures but not sure will that capture what every essence of it. #letsguide"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A wonderful museum! The exhibition of ""Future.."" is a very beautiful visual experience and an interesting activity for children. The exhibition of minimalism is also an artpiece for those who appreciate this art style."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great educational entertainment for all ages. Tickets per individual is SGD 19, which is moderately affordable, however if you come as a group, the collective price would be cheaper. Whether you come alone or with friends and family, the offered experience would be as just rewarding. I visited ""Wonderland"" on June 24th and had a blast!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A true icon in singapore, the ArtScience museum offers a variety of exhibitions throughout the year. Do check its website for the different exhibitions there. Some is free, others are paid attractions but if it's what you like why not?😎"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Alice in the wonderland. Waste of time n money.

Boring and underwhelming experience. It’s just a small hall, with a total of 3-5 staff (that I saw, just to show how small) barricaded with doors and walls... some painting and old films... bad museum experience. Little interaction, never ‘wow’ once. I spotted people yawning, apart from myself.

Personally I didn’t enjoy and won’t recommend.
But I did that Future world is better."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"There is a 1 for 1 promotion for Marina Bay Sands Members. I bought tickets for 2 exhibit and got another 2. Visited the future world and 2219 exhibit, walked away impressed at how interactive some of the exhibits (top of my head is the sound room in 2219). Do give it a try, some of the exhibits make for cool Instagram photos."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great architecture,  great exhibition, very informative. Definitely recommend going here if you're in Singapore. Tickets aren't too pricey and exhibitions are fairly engaging."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Love the exhibitions, the disney exhibition is probably my 5th exhibition at artscience museum. A few exhibition i went to there were the titanic, harry potter, marvel and mummy exhibition . The titanic exhibition was amazing. The rest..could have been better if it was a little more interactive. Overall, their exhibitions were very informative."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"An absolute must for those travelling to Singapore. The Science side of the museum is mostly interactive and perfect for kids of all ages. The Art side maybe less so, and is a much quieter experience. There’s also a Natural History aspect to the museum, where you are able to witness exhibits millions of years old. Tickets are required for all 3 exhibits, which are bought on the Basement 2 floor (you will come in through the lobby a floor above the basement). Escalators and elevators can take you to all floors, and 99% of exhibits can be experience by everyone (a slide in the Science exhibit requires stairs to ride)."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I absolutely loved the Art Science Museum, probably the top thing to do in Singapore. The art is beautiful and there are a lot of interactive features that are fun for children and adults alike. If you are visiting with one other person,  I would recommend you to sign up for the Sands rewards card (free) online. I was able to get buy one get one for admissions which is amazing."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great exhibition hall
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Loved this! Spectacular light instillation show. Price was good. It was also very soothing ! Magical place for not just kids but adults also.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Local blend of art, tech, and science. Saw the local photography series and plastic exhibition.  Recommend 2 hrs to go through it all."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"Good for kiddies. More art ""exhibition"" than a museum. I've skipped Marvell exhibition as I'm not really into comics universe. Bunch of lovely lights though..."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Amazing marvel exhibition. The kids had a blast and so did I. The location is fantastic, and the building is awesome and the facilities are of a high standard.  Highly recommend going here to any exhibition that might be on. Their online booking system could do with some improvements however."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Nice museum. They combine art and science, it’s turn out very well and it’s approve that museum isn’t always boring. Parents can bring their child here to play yet learn something new. Instagram-able place to take photos. It’s near from the merlion park, F1 circuit and gardens by the bay."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Where the arts meets science , best place to  go with kids ❤️ I enjoyed this place very well ! It will take 2-3 hours to complete the trip ☺️"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great to finally see the Star Wars Exhibition!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A great exhibition and the staffs are friendly.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Like the Star Wars Identities exhibition 🙂
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Wonderful museum with lots of interesting & interactive exhibitions all year round! Enjoyable experience for both adults and children!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Awesome place! Lots of kids running around but still worth your time.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World: Great for kids, a family day out.
Planet or Plastic: An eye opening exhibition by Nat Geo, Great for grown ups.
Seasonal Exhibitions depend on your interests but a great place nonetheless; do get tix from Klook or travel agents as official sites are a tad more pricey."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,May the force be with you
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,A bit disappointed for only small area and most of the activities are mainly for kids(coloring and scan to show our coloring on screen)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I liked to come here because of the Disney themes. All my life were filled with Disney memories, started from Mickey Mouse & Donald Duck, followed to Snow White & 7 Dwarfs and also The Pinnochio, until the modern movie such as Maleficent. By coming here, I was given every amazing proccess (that wasn't so easy) from the manual sketch until using the visual effect and stereo sound to make a detail and flawless Disney movies every single year.."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great special exhibits if you happen to catch them. While the Marvel Studios exhibit is pretty cool for pictures, it’s not in-depth enough for the hardcore Marvel Fan

The Windwalkers exhibit of great if you can catch the scheduled demonstrations.

The Future World is basically an AR playground for kids to enjoy."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Its very nice place. We visited future world section. Kids enjoyed a lot. It feels very colourful there. Crystal universe is awesome...
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"Small venue with very limited exhibits.  It's nice but not worth the money or the time.  Its managed by MBS, so they don't put much of an effort into it.  You should measure your expectations of this museum, as it's managed by a Casino.

Your better off at the National Gallery or the National Museum both are far better venues with more too see."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The ArtScience building itself is an architectural sight to see - you can’t miss its sweeping curves across the skyline.

Situated on the edge of the harbour steps away from the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, this museum has an array of exhibitions and is a great place to visit for a few hours whilst in the vicinity of Marina Bay Sands.

Take the elevator to the basement to buy your admission tickets and enjoy wandering around this unique museum. Make sure you check out the Future World exhibition - full of interactive light installations created by teamLab.

ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,AMAZING 👏
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Visited Marvel's 10 year exhibition today. Was great to see these huge figurines up close and in so much detail. While fun, it's rather short-lived and maybe just only worth the $12 I paid. Still a must see for Marvel fans, though."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Loved the interactive art installations.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"You can buy one exhibit, two or all. Right next to helix bridge, and always someone there to answer questions.
Cute science art quotes on the walls, and a spectacular place for both kids and adults.

Future world meets science exhibit, it's small, visually pleasing and the room at the end where you enter ""space"" the lights are amaaazing. The security guy can control the lights but can only tell you when super nova is coming. Stick around for that!

Downstairs upon entering you walk into the fab cafe, they have 3D printing available and cute little earrings too! Popcorn flavors like calamari, sour cream and onion and also prosciutto (snacks available)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A must-visit if you are into museums, science or architecture. It's also close to Marina Bay, which is really convenient. I was truly impressed by the Richard Feynman exposition."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"ArtScience Museum is very exciting. I love the space, the inhouse build sounds are very engaging.

The exhibition of Alice in Wonderland is so so good. I have a magical feeling while watching such a historical record of a classic.

There are also many exciting exhibitions all year round.

Overall I had an amazing experience.

#ILoveArtScienceMuseum. #ThankYou"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We've only visited one exposition, but it was so great I still am under impression. The museum is very well located, well maintained and has a lot to offer. Perfect place to chill out when it's too hot outside. Recommended."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The place for the artsy nerdieeeee..love it. They have numerous attraction like color light ballon,  virtualizing our coloring sheets. And so many . ps : My mum get elderly discount . so? I'll be back again with my kids soon ."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great exploration for family and kids.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,I expected to see something fascinating but saw only kids pictures through projectors. nothing new or knowledgeable. the shape of the museum is only the one attraction there
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Look for Top floor free exhibitions, they generally show movies for free.. If you are tired walking around marina bay sands.. Walk and relax with free wifi.. Plus they give couch to lay down and watch movie"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Absolute fun for any age IF you can go in with an open kind and heart. Give your inner child an opportunity to express and enjoy!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"The most fun I had was at Crystal Universe in the exhibition Future World. Other things in it are fun for kids, not so much for adults. The other 2 exhibitions Planet or Plastic and some other one were boring."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Nice experience and about future world.plan I don't have words for explain how much its was nice over all great experience
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Went to see the StarWars exhibition. Great time playing with the interactive display. Found out my true galaxial calling. Palatine is calling.... 🤣
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Nice museum, view and experience. so many digital art. You must be there"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Pretty amazing place for kids. Though not many exhibits in the Future World. Maybe 6? But it was nice experience.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Spectacular.. loved each art... Lots of theories cooked up in mind... Never thought I'd be this interested... An awesome experience..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,We didn't expect much as these things are usually very kid oriented. Went in just to see the building from inside but were pleasantly surprised. Not too many things to see but the few installations they had were excellent. If you are travelling with kids I'm sure they can spend few hours exploring the place. Has a student discount too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"Nice views at day and night, very relax place for local and tourist."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A must visit place for children and Adults who love art and science. Innovative and interactive displays can keep the children engaged for a long while. Enjoyable for adults too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"recommended for children's and family education tours, there are 3 places for future world, utophia, wonderland opening hours of 10 am, located dimarina bay sands mall👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Happy day before start school 😃😍😍😍🤩
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Had a really cool experience here. Came here to check out the future world exhibition. This was an awesome exhibition, great place to get some cool photos. Fun and great experience. This is a great exhibition to check out , also fun for kids as well."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"full of artistic presentations. the outlook of this building is very special. enjoying the exhibition need to pay.

lucky me visiting this place when teamlab is operating exhibition.

with Singapore airline air tix booking can enjoy 50% off."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,💛☀️ Just simply love my #📸📷 #artsignmuseum & ArtScience Museum. #ArtScienceMuseum 🌌❇ Long Time No See.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"A lovely futuristic, immersive experience. The  museum has some incredible international artist installations. Many of them are experiential and this adds to the overall enjoyment."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great little place with stunning views and surroundings. Once inside, staff were friendly and plentiful, giving good efficient service. Exhibition room were all laid out and presented. Overall a great experience."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great exhibit. It really is the convergence of Art and Science/Tech. Be sure to draw and make it come to life through their large interactive LED screen.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"I love the art, they're really futuristic, but because i came in weekend, the exhibition became so crowded. Need more space for many visitors."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Fantastic architecture - exhibitions future world was disappointing, Marvel was great fun and Windwalkers was brilliant.  Lookout for the sky mirror real good fun"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Interesting exhibitions with immersive digital light experiences mostly suiting families and though-provoking art/science exhibitions.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Loved it! They have different shows and exhibitions from time to time.  Instagrammable site as well.  The lotus-shaped building is meant to welcome everyone from all over the world.  Or just chill at the Fab Cafe, comes from the word Fabrication Cafe, as they display stuff fabricated by 3D Printer."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,Maybe this is ok for little kids but adults better spend their $$ on something else. Just admire museum's building from outside.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"What a stellar of a place this is, an absolute gem of the tourist attractions if you find science and technology interesting.

This place was not on my list before my brother recommended this.

The Marvel exhibition is scintillating showcasing the decade long history of Marvel, you can also watch your favourite marvel characters and read about them in dedicated zones.

The section also featured a short film on how these blockbuster movies are made and how technology plays a major role in the overall film production.

The other future exhibition is amazing as well, it has an amazing kids section where if you color something, it can come to life and would be projected in 3d over a very big screen.

The exhibits I guess keeps on changing from time to time.

Overall this place can be covered within 2 hours.

A must visit place if you are visiting Singapore as a tourist."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting place. Disney exhibition was nice.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"I had already seen the Future World exhibition last year, which was really enjoyable. So, this time I went to see 2219: Futures Imagined. Felt disappointed with the exhibition. The featured topic was interesting but most of the art works were not engaging. I would gladly recommend anyone to visit the museum and see the Future World exhibition but NOT 2219: Futures Imagined."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Where art meets science was a great exhibit.. it us very kid friendly too.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,If you have very less time and need to decide which museum to visit I would suggest this one. You will experience the world of colours implemented by technology. Worth spending time here than one of the other expensive attractions in Sentosa.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Was there for the Marvel Exhibition. The place is so unique and can't resist to take picture of them all. You have to pay SIN $19 for each exhibition, but you'll get special price if you buy package of 2 or 3 exhibitions in one ticket. But unfortunately, this place is lack of souvenir things live pin or postcard, so nothing to be taken as memory from the ArtScience itself. But you can buy the Marvel or another things as a souvenir (a bit pricey)."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Loved the experience especially the Team Lab exhibition which provided a lot of fun and interaction. A great place to visit with other exhibitions here as well.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Before you enter this museum you'll be blown away by its construction. The architecture is so unique! The building represents a flower and the entire museum is surrounded by a lilly pond. Once you enter you'll use a lift to access different floors. I bought a ticket that allowed me to visit 2 exhibitions. The future world's exhibition which is a room designed by TeamLab and includes some very interesting interactive sections. It's great entertainment for kids and adults. There was a fruit ninja slide, a room with thousands of led lights that made it feel like you were teleported to another dimension and surrounded by colorful stars, it's also the perfect room for that Instagram selfie. There was also a giant screen that represented an aquarium where u could draw on a piece of paper, scan it and see your drawing come to life. The entire exhibition felt like a very hi-tech art installation and I enjoyed it. The other exhibition was about future Singapore. It showcased visions of the future on how Singapore plans to combat and work alongside an ever growing threat which is global warming and climate change. It was an absolute eye opener but it gave u great insight into how Singapore would prepare for dooms day scenarios. Singapore is all about conservation and building a better future to reduce climate change. I highly recommend visiting the Art Science Museum."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great museum. I visited during the Disney exhibition and the digital labs exhibit. I highly recommend both. Digital labs for its interactiveness and pure fun and the Disney one for its childhood nostalgia. Its amazing what the Disney studio was able to produce using its own innovative techniques before technology became what it is today.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Was amazing to walk through the LED/star show piece.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting place to go for family. Its near the shopping mall with Merlion view. You can choose one of 3 themes or just buy all pass ticket. Fun for kids and family...
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A must visit spot if you enjoy the coming together of art & science. One of my favourites places to visit. Highly inspiring pieces of work showcased.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"There are free exhibit at ArtScience Museum, definitely a place to go as the exhibits are interesting.

Went for the human plus and future world! Both exhibits is great.

Singapore citizen please bring your IC and for student please bring your student pass for discount. Senior citizen as well"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing cutting edge digital installation. Not recommend the floating utopia.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great experience here,funny teamlab exhibition. Entry free a bit expensive."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Fun and interesting!!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great display.. kids are really love this.. very instagrammable.. the ticket price is $19 for adults..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great place to explore in singapore
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"This is must visit if you are a tourist or have kids you need to keep entertained. The museum usually has a free exhibit and several you need to pay for. We checked out the ""Future world"" and Alice in Wonderland exhibitions. If you are accompanied by children they are bound to find most aspects entertaining. The only caveat is that adults may find some activities underwhelming."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,My boys said they have a good time there. Very interesting exhibition and interactive for children. Should go there at least once
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Show us how they made us remind of childhood story espacially Disney museum..
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Fabulous view and experience. The museumos not very big but full of interesting things
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Completely impressed. In Jan. 2017 saw the NASA and Escher exhibits. Very in depth information. Free guided tours in multiple languages. Photography is allowed. Lots of interactive stations, and every exhibit has a children's workbook."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,Constant noise and light agression with short noise looped and light pulses. Nothing artsy nor scientific about it. I'm still dizzy from it without even being epileptic. Poor interactions even though they are glorified in other reviews.. Not worth the two dollars paid to enter (with rediscover discount). Excellent to excite and make your kids go haywire (if they weren't enough haywire already).
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Cosmis space is amazing...maybe it could worth the ticket but need time to enjoy when jot many people around
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,It was a bliss! A little bit cold inside however quite comfortable to experience the whole muesum. Staff is friendly and kind. I will come back again for another events for sure.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Fantastic museum. Great interactive exhibitions. Highly recommended for children and those grown ups who still like to play.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Love the concept aesthetics. The Future World is a permanent exhibit, but others change from year to year. Well worth s visit on occasion."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Loved this .. specially the future world .. it was so unique & beautiful.. its a must visit in Singapore.. though I didn't like the serendipity & Human s of the future that much but still it's a great place to visit.. it's truely an amazing place.. must visit
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The place is so big you need a long time to see it. We only saw the Marvel exposition and it was fun and interactive.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great exhibitions staged here and next to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Mall
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Was here for the minimalism exhibition.

Reception and on-the-ground staff were friendly and informative. The ticket queue was long when we arrived, but service was fast. Staff did not rush us at our turn, and gave us useful answers to our questions.

Place is stunning and well maintained. Love the coffee shop at the lift lobby. Hope to try it out one day."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Worth every penny! We went to the future world exhibition only as we arrived later than expected with only 2 hours till closing time. The two hours flew by and some parts we didn't explore to the same extent as others. Organised so well, all the staff were very friendly and enthusiastic which, after a long day at a weekend, is highly commendable! The highlights for us were the aquarium where you can design your own sea creature and its scanned into the tank and the lights which I embarrassingly can't remember the name of. For the lights we highly recommend walking all the way through and taking a seat to watch them and visitors interact with them. If you follow the link on the wall you can choose what sequences and colours are used which hardly anyone was doing so we had great fun picking!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great event to see.
#2219FuturesImagined"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The museum building itself is worth being seen ! The exhibitions vary depending on what they are showing at the moment but the thing we really lived was the lights showroom. It makes the most astonishing photos!:)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Great experience at the Art Science Muesum, best to come early, less crowd. Loving the exhibits ❤️❤️. The service staffs were friendly n approachable. Keep it up!!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The Feynman exhibition was great. The astronaut ice cream can be found in the shop
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great place for kids. 2 expos need about 2 hours, not more"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"AR featured installation are really nice
Must visit for students"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great experience - visited with husband and 17 year old daughter.    Something for every age group including young children.   Highly recommend as a family experience
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Great architecture design, great route planned inside. Great view around too! Often hold various events to public. I was there for a moon related event and it was very fruitful. Somehow some of the exhibitions tickets can be expensive."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great place to go for New Year 🤩 eve.

You get to see the light works!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"Not much crowded for the StarWars, but not really worth of cost. Part of the MBS visit seems to be okay if you find anything interesting."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Fun and surreal exhibition
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Nice place for education.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"Is a place for children.  Quite boring for adults.  As for the price paid, not worth it. Nothing much and don't have any excitement..."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"A great place to visit while at Singapore. They have 3 exhibits all of which have been curated to the highest standards and for a diverse audience.

Even if you're not one who likes to read everything written inside, it sure does make an interesting visit. This place is a haven't for people who love to pay attention to the finer details of arts, the exhibit for Minimalism was my personal favourite. I was so involved I forgot to take photos of that one exhibit.

There are alot of great photo opportunities as well at the museum, but kindly note the exhibits are quite dark and you would need a camera with good high ISO performance (or good lowlight performance) to get the best results. You also aren't allowed to take videos or use flash.

I'd love to stop by at this place again next time I'm at Singapore."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"The inflatables exhibit is beautiful,  thought provoking and educational."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,I had an awesome experience here as the exhibition is very interactive and the entrance fee is affordable. Recommended to visit during non peak hours as it's easier to take photos and could enjoy the exhibition better. There's also a lot of places to sit and look around at the exhibition. But the whole exhibition is quite small.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting Art Science Museum
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I visted ArtScience Musuem on 7th Sep and I had a amazing time there. I would like to commend Marilia for the fantastic tour that she gave on the Alice in the Wonderland Exhibit. She was really enthusiastic and friendly throughout the tour. She provided alot of insights to the exhibit, bringing the experience to another level. I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if she was not there.

The Alice in the Wonderland exhibit tells the evolution Alice, how she started from the pages of a book to slient movies to the big screen and the story behind the scenes. If you love to see how it unravels I highly recommend visiting the exhibit before it ends on 22nd September"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Here for Wonderland exhibition. Since I love Alice in Wonderland so much. It really beyond my expectations, it's really cool! Worth every penny."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We chose to see the Future World: Where Art Meets Science
which was intriguing and interactive. Would certainly recommend a visit.
The museum is a striking building."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always a great place to spend a few hours in the afternoon...
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very nice jungle walk. Awesome experience.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good exhibition inside! Worth to watch 💕
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful digital interactive art to fulfill all instagram desires. Do check out the other exhibits as well. Mature for an entertaining day out.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Went for the Alice in Wonderland exhibition. Enjoyed the interactive portion immensely, as well as learning Alice's history & origin. Though the highlight was really only the Queen's Croquet Ground (suitable for all ages), it is definitely still worth a visit if you want to experience something magical and fun albeit for a brief moment.
I wished the lost map had more interactive activity within the exhibition."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A modern architecture houses several interactive exhibits about science and art. A great place to bring young inquisitive kids. Staff here are very helpful especially Aini who recovered a jewelry dropped from the elevator during my visit.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,A great way to Instagram your day
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Not quite like Shanghai.. and probably no where near Tokyo (to be confirmed).. the exhibit is a little small/ underwhelming and lacking the scale/ wow factor. I was a tad disappointed.. as I was expecting more having seen TeamLab overseas before.. but some aspects of the exhibit is still worth experiencing (especially when the ticket is not too expensive - at least for the locals/ PR)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Went to the Disney exhibition:)
Great place for both children and adults."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"High quality exhibitions introduced, everyone should come and learn some knowledge. If you are a big fan of art or science , it is definitely a place you must come. Spending half day here during weekend, you will fill very much achieved."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Kids totally loved this as I did.  Absolute must do.  You could easily spend 4 hours here.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"We went for the Star Wars, it's interesting. Anyone should try going, the Rediscover Singapore voucher can be use."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Beautiful building close to (or beside) Marina Bay Sands, shaped as a lotus flower with an open pool at the centre. A stunning piece of architecture !! If you depart the MRT at Bayfront you can continue walking through the shopping centre so that you stay under cover and out of the heat. The entrance is close to the final exit door then proceed to B1 for ticketing. Current offer - If you download the Marina Bay Sands lifestyle card (it’s free) you can get 1 free full price admission when you purchase another full priced ticket :)"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,The art future museum was a little short and I thought there would be more. The Infinity crystal curtains was cool and there are super cool visually stunning places to relax. I don't know why they allow kids in the first room. They were running around and kind of ruined something that otherwise would have been 100% visually stunning and spectacular. I would definitely recommend doing this. The art in the other museums are GREAT. Make sure to make your mark on the wall!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice for kids, for adults it might be boring. They have a special gallery about disney movie animations right now."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,So much fun. Must come here to have some fun especially for kid. Loves those drawing that made into a real movement
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Must visiting place as there is future games and technology you will found. Need pictures then you need good camera as flash is not allowed there.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Still my favorite place to visit when coming to Singapore, would recommend to book tickets online coz it's cheaper n convenient."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,I went to the Future World Exhibition. I think it is a good exhibition esp for family of primary school children. Go on friday coz up to 4 kids free for every paying adult. I enjoyed the slide the most. There are many other activities.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing building.. nice inside
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Visiting the marvel exhibition. Dont expect to much just a normal display of the marvel movie. But still its the best for marvel movie fans.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I’ve visited Future World Exhibition, it was great! There are many activities for all ages. You can spend half a day enjoying the exhibition and activities. It’s worth to bring your camera here so you can take many pictures around."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"This should really be called a children's museum because all of the exhibitions were for mainly kids. It was a little fun as an adult, but overall it was very underwhelming and expensive. Plus, there's only a couple things to see, so even though we interacted with some of the installations and took our time, the whole experience was only about 30-40 minutes. Excellent for children though, from what we saw."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future world exhibit is open these days, and is great for an hour of interactive and immersive play. The kids slides are closed because of Covid19 protective measures but that is only a small part of the activities on offer. Kids (and grownups!) will enjoy the creative tasks, interactive light and sound exhibits, and the stunning crystal universe room. Covid measures: Gloves are provided and mandatory throughout and there are sanitizers available at every exhibit. Visitors are limited per time slot so it is better to book online."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Went for Future World & Plastic exhibition
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always fun stuff occurring I like the way the try do something new and innovative with the exhibits
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Innovative and interactive fun for all ages. Keeps you busy and forget the time. Worth the admission fee.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The one of places that you must go if yo were in Singapore, especially in Garden by The Bay and Marina Bay area. There is two theme in this museum, Future world and Minimalism. Same Museum as well as is in Japan. The ticket for each theme is about 18 SGD. You also can buy this ticket on Klook Apps and get some disc for your ticket. Smart country, maybe I say Yess for Singapore."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Had a great time with friends at the latest Marvel Avengers exhibition!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice place to explore for a few hours, great for kids with lots of attractions and couples as well, the future world exhibition was awesome"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice place for museum, if you has been a member here you get a 10-30% depend a show, I just lucky got a 10 years of marvel"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,I was able to go to only the space exhibit and the one located at the higher floors. The space exhibit houses good and interesting pieces. It plays a lot with the contrast of color in a very dark place. However it tends to get crowded on weekends and vacation time so have to be fast with taking your pictures. There may also be a lot of kids in the area so be careful with walking around as you may bump into them (since the place is very dark. There are fewer pieces at the higher floors and honestly not much for picture taking. Go try to interact and play as much as possible with the exhibits!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A great place for both local and tourists to explore cool innovations in Arts and Science. Lots of exhibitions i.e the Future World exhibitions which is a great spotlight for kids and adults.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Every exhibition is unique and very special.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Many interesting  exhibition that can blow your mind and architecture there is amazing
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Very nice place to go for kids, the exhibits are interactive and you can't see them in other places, it's really one of a kind"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Such a great experience here, i try marvel studio exhibition. Recommended to visit !"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Always love to drop by here for exhibitions. It is not very big but good enough to enjoy art and find your inner feelings towards arts.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The future exhibition is quite fun for kids. The space a bit small thou
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,must visit at least once in life!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful museum !!! It's a must if you visit Singapore. Great combination of art and science
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"I had been dreaming of visiting the ArtScience Museum of Singapore for YEARS before actually seeing it! The buildings architecture was within itself a work of art. The exhibits were beautifully crafted, highly interactive, and very technologically advanced as opposed to various other museums and galleries I’ve visited. The staff and programming team at the ArtScience Museum truly make sure all visitors and patrons have a wonderful experience. It’s something I will always remember!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,This place was so amazing and so futuristic I loved it
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Notable 5 stars museum. This place is not only  great for kids but teens and adults are also enjoyed.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A true view of a blend between science and art...a must visit in Singapore. Planet or plastic was an awesome make to make all of realise were are heading anf if we don't take measures now what we leave for our generation next...
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"It was totally a unique concept using Augmented reality. Here the kids can play slider,color pictures which will start moving on the screen and floor once they are scanned and with lights the museum has created a space concept which was quite different."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,It’s cool! But it’s definitely for kids... probably not a must go for anyone that’s not looking to get a gram off
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World for kids! What a wonderful experience, great to being the kids, lovely!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"The famous light exhibition is the highlight. I booked my tickets online so it was easier to get in. However, it was too crowded and I couldn’t take a nice picture because the staff also hurries you to let the “influencers” take pictures.
It should be a timed session like Yayoi Kusama infinity room."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Future world is much better for kids than I thought a museum could be!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good for kids and family
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Overall is great experience about exhibitions. However, the whole museum is quite a compact building, can spend 1-2 hours for the whole tour."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The art science museum is one of my favourite place in Singapore and IV been visiting it each time I go there. I loved the thought provoking exhibits that they have and there's sometime knew everytime. The place outside is beautiful. Unlike most places in Singapore they were more that happy to take care of the luggage. Its also quite well organised
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Go with children, it's a great place for them to explore, especially at Future World where there are light shows, children and adults can color, slide, and play. The building is hard to miss, shaped like a lotus flower.
If you're bringing luggage with you,  you can drop it on Level 1, near the cafeteria."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,The Disney exhibition was magical. Needed more than 2 hours to properly finish the exhibition. Went a second time and it was still as magical as the first time I went.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great little diversion while it was raining out. The street art exhibit e excellent.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"The museum is very organized and the staff are friendly. When I attended it was during the Windwalkers exhibit. We were lucky that we got to see the reanimation of the devices. We also visited the installation about science and art which was more for kids, but still enjoyable. I think the price for both exhibits was around S$30. I dont recall but each exhibit is a seperate ticket."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,The light exhibit is good. Other parts of the exhibit seem best for children.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Awesome experience to see technology and art
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting and exciting museum to explore and learn more about star wars.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Great hi-tech science museum. Ticket is 19 SGD per person. If you sign up for a free members card at the Marina Bay Sands Cansino, you can get buy 1 ticket and get 1 free discount."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,I came here for Marvel Studios - Ten Years Of Heroes and Future World - Where Art Meet Science. Both shows are good. But ticket prices are high.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Awesome experience will recommend everyone
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Good exhibitions with kid friendly activities.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Is a nice place with nice exhibition.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great experience and worth my money!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Better with kids. Nice to take picture. Such a unique experience.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Love this place. Fantastic location right at Marina Bay with a superb view. The museum features interesting exhibitions at fair prices and even has a small shop and cafe at its lobby. Staff is super friendly and the whole place is designed in a modern, open way."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Totally filled with facts and remind us of childhood
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Fantastic museum. The teamlab's exhibition is definitely better in Japan but it's worth it. The Alice in Wonderland exhibition was amazing!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Not fun for boring people!
Good interactive experience with science and technology. Buy a ticket online in advance to maybe avoid queuing and have a better price. Interactivity is wonderful and fun for kids. However there are a lot of angles to take art pictures for Instagram or Facebook for adults, so do not visit alone. Should visit their official site first and research about exhibitions."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"It's a must visit place if you're in Singapore. This museum not just an artistic place, but enhanced with latest technology. Draw your own car and you will see your drawing comes alive."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Nice place with friendly staff, exhibitions done well"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"This place is cool...but the spots is not much since the opened gallery is only 1. Of you have visited Jatim Park 3, they have the similar place like this"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"This museum has a beautiful architectural design that serves as a perfect backdrop when you are in the Merlion area. This museum also is just a few meters away from the Shoppes and the Helix Bridge. Bring your kids along when you enter this museum, they will learn a lot!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great modern museum. Family and especially young son had a great time exploring the exhibitions
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,I thought it would have been better. If you really like museums you might like it a lot
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Most Science based shows never forgets to visit this meusium. Loved the recent Star wars show and totally recommended for fans.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Interesting exhibits! Use your SG rediscover vouchers while you can!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Beautiful museum, well worth the money! Great for kids and adults."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Great place to visit with young children. Worth spending an hour.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Fun, mostly for kids. Interactive art, cool projections of your own drawings. Overall, a little repetitive for me, but the climate change exhibitions were very good and serious, somewhat undermined by the cafe here giving us plastic straws!!!!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Nice views. Great place.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Very well organised and a lovely area outside.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,More for kids but fun but still enjoyable. The Alice in wonderland exhibition is excellent and details some very interesting interpretations of the story...see pics!!!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing and exciting place to visit. I just realized the exhibitions theme change every year here. I would be interesting if they add more section in future world.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,Not value for the money you spend on tickets.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,1,"Came here to visit the ‘future world’ exhibit, bought the tickets online and the system prompted us to buy tickets based on time slots.

Bought the tickets for 445pm visit, and when I reached the entrance of the exhibit at 435pm (I thought I was early enough), I was greeted with a snaking Long queue.. was told that we have to queue to enter and it is not really based on allocated time slots. So I ended up queuing to enter. it took me at least 30 minutes of waiting before I could get my family in.

So what’s the point of selling tickets based on allocated time slot when you still require the visitors to queue and enter the exhibit one at a time.. ASM seriously need to relook at how the ticketing system is designed (or at least not set too many time intervals for people to purchase your tickets online or at counter when you can’t even control and manage the crowd visiting) and not let others be disappointed and wait longer than they expected to.. while sales is important, customer service and satisfaction after visiting is equally so"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Good for children. The museum combines a vast of AR games which visitors can play with.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,2,"Given the reviews, i believed it would be something marvelous, but was a bit disappointing. Its very kid friendly, not more for adults"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We spend several hours together with our two kids (5 and 8 years old) at the museum when visiting Singapore in July 2018. We visited the Marvel Super Heroes exhibition and the Future World exhibition.

The Marvel Super Hearo was a bit disappointing, and we went through it in around half an hour. It might be better suited for older kids or adults.

Afterwards we visited the Future World Exhibition, which we enjoyed very much. The exhibition holds a series of interactive installations, which are aimed at kids, and they enjoyed it very much. It allows them to be creative, and combines e.g. drawings with modern technology by allowing to scan your drawing to bring it alive in a interactive screen or on the floor.

Your kids can spend hours exploring the exhibition, and I would highly recommend a visit if visiting Singapore with kids.

The exhibition is mostly aimed at kids. If you do not have kids with you, it can still be worth a visit as there are a few more general (and very nice) installations, but I would recommend to experience something else instead, as it will be a short visit without kids."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,beautiful little museum in one of the most stunning locations. it wont take long to walk through.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Great place to visit with family and friends! Also get to play with interactive technology. Had lots of fun here!
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"When art meet science, interesting place. It location is very close to Marina Bay Sand Mall."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Amazing place to spend time with family. Gets a little too crowded during school holidays and. Weekends... But you won’t be disappointed
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Lights and amusement ignited the mood of kids
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Expensive entry and the exhibition is just ok. Famous for being famous
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Highly recommended, they have some really great exhibits on. Went recently for the Windwalkers Stranbeests, and the Marvel Avengers 10 years exhibits. The latter wasn't as good but the Windwalkers was great."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"Future World is a highly interactive exhibition.. Great for children, fun for adults. Worth the ticket price."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,3,"I've never known what this museum was about, assuming that it's a gallery of art and science artefacts and displays. It's actually just full of interactive digital displays and lights that's fun for kids. Children (and adults) can draw sea animals or spaceships and buses, and scan them up onto a wall where there's a projection of it moving around. Definitely not a place many would choose to go a second time."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,A wonderful architecture comes with interesting exhibition. One of the exhibition was the Future World by Teamlab (creative group from Japan)
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful architecture building. The expositions are changing every few months. I was in the one related the spatial travellers and was very curious.
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"We experienced ""Future World: Where Arts Meet Science!"" today and it was fun and interactive. A must see for family with kids.."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,Cool lights in the future world exhibition. Recommended for having fun!¯\_ʘ‿ʘ_/¯
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Museum located in the same area, at  Marina Bay, in the afternoon, the beauty of the entire place is very interesting. A new couple are engaged in a photo session."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"A very intresting experience. Good place to bring your kids. Interactive activities and educational for the kids, but also interesting for adults."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"One place not to miss in Singapore. Relatively inexpensive, we went to the future exhibition only, however there was also a minimalist one on too. It was amazing, there were interactive kinetic digital exhibitions where people could interact with the projected images. You could also draw pictures, scan them in and they would be generated on the wall. Great for grown up travellers and also those with kids. Check out the light installation too!"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,5,"The last I went was with my colleagues for a colorful, pokadots, balloons & art showcase. It was fun.. haven't been there for a while, def worth a trip"
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Although the entrance ticket was slightly pricey, it was a fun experience for me and my friends. There were several exhibitions when we visited and some were free whilst others required entrance tickets. I especially enjoyed the “Future World - where art meets science” exhibition! It was eye-opening and also insta-worthy;) My friends and I are planning to for a second visit for the Wind Walker exhibition."
ArtScience Museum Singapore,4,"Went there as an educational trip for me and my friend, the que was averagely long but alright! The food was expensive"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Nice place to learn about the Japanese occupation era. The museum is not crowded so you can take your time to visit without any disturbance at all. Nothing to eat in the museum though so best is to prepare some snack on your own. Parking is free. For those take bus will be quite troublesome though.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Interesting place to learn Singapore history with a misleading name and entrance. It's nothing to do with the Ford factory except for the building and some items in the lobby.
This is an exhibition for the history from the fall of British till the beginning of the Republic.
Not so many items but the stories and explanations are interesting, complementing the History subject that the children get in school."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Exhibition is free for Singaporean and Permanent Resident. Got a glimpse of Singapore history during WWII occupation. Wish we could see more interior of the former factory setup, but you'll only get to see the exhibit installation. Still it's a good trip."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Not so famous tourist site, but I enjoyed here. You'll learn the history of Japanese invation era. Near by Bukit Timah Nature reserve or Hindhede National park."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,2,The way that history is displayed here shows a subtle but rather disgusting anti Anglo-British bias. Many quotes plastered on the wall are from oral interviews of nobodies which also betray this bias. The Japanese atrocities of WW11 are conveniently forgotten and the British surrender emphasised in almost every room. If resonates with the new anti-British message lurking behind and promoting new and disturbing Singaporean ultra nationalism. There is nothing in the museum about cars!
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"The museum was great, giving detailed information about Singapore history connecting with the former Ford factory. Free entry for Singaporeans & PRs, $3.00 admission fee for foreigners.
It is located near the Rail Corridor if you like hiking."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,A beautiful art deco building with lots of history. The displays in the Ford Factory provide a good overview of what happened in Singapore during WW2 and how easily the Gibraltar of the East fell to the Japanese.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Very interesting and visually well presented history of Singapore during World War 2. Candid and well balanced view on colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, and the decline of the Colonial empire after the war."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Extremely informative. I would recommend you take your child here. It gives them a good idea of the fight for freedom. The exhibitions here are historically accurate. I liked that they had a different and unique theme for different parts of the museum.
They made it interactive learning but it is currently closed due to COVID-19. They have also paid respects to soldiers from different cultures and ethnicities.
They have planted a war garden which shows all the plants they used during the war.
Overall, I really loved this place and would definitely recommend for you to visit."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Very interesting place to visit in Singapore. It shows a lot of artifacts from World War 2 in Singapore and show some of the things that lead to the fall of Singapore and what happened afterwards. It shows a dark period in Singapore and the lighting helps supplement the experience. Overall,  would recommend to Singaporeans to visit"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Super quiet and peaceful place to be.. everything here is clean and well maintained. Really love to be here
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,A place that carries a great historical significance of Singapore during the WW2. It's now converted to a museum that brings to visitors a lot of facts about Singapore during WW2.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,This is where you can learn about the history of Singapore during world war 2. Quite cozy and it's free for Singaporean and PR.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,An extensive exhibition on Singapore war history
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Interesting, well curated and informative exhibition. Well-presented, accurate in date order. Well worth a visit!

The Art Deco building is also stunning."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"Very friendly staff n beautiful green surroundings.  However, felt displays could have included more visual elements to supplement the information.   Was hoping to see actual or lookalike WWII items such as equipment used or uniforms, transmitter radios n such. My friend felt lighting  could be improved for some pictures in the mid section.   Overall, decent effort but could be more engaging or dramatic visually."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A museum that showcases the history of Singapore during War World 2, particularly during the the Japanese Occupation. Everything on display (e.g. posters, artifacts, interactives) were well curated."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Informative and educational visit to this Former Ford Factory to have some understanding of the time of Japanese Occupation of Singapore, with the British Surrender. Olden day ID , Japanese notes and many other interesting documents or newspaper report are on display. Allow one and a half hour to slowly see the exhibits and learn about the history. Worth bringing the children and have it as a family outing."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Memories at the Old Ford Factory serves a reminder about Singapore's vulnerable past when Britain surrendered the former colony to Japanese Imperial Army on 15 February 1942. This gazetted National Monument is a great live history lesson for locals and tourists alike who is keen to learn the devastation of war on livelihood of Singapore at that time. Kudos to National Archives of Singapore and National Heritage Board for the amazing World War II immersion to recreate the experience of how hard life was under Japanese occupation.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very informative place. Free of charge for singaporeans. Come here since you cannot travel anyway.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Nicely reveals the history of the period before and after World War II.
3 dollars for foreigner is acceptable."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"Another war memorial museum.
Nice recap of pre and post ww2, Japanese occupation in SG.
Would expect some history about car industry in SG, photos of the factory car assembly etc and how Ford factory has contributed to the economy at that time."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,From British Singapore to Japanese Syonan-To
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Visited the Former Ford Factory today. Very interesting. Appreciated the guided tour but I think I would have to return for a visit to view all the exhibits and read the inscriptions again. A little bit of history.  I like that it is interactive. The guide was helpful with his stories. Plan to spend at least half a day here. We were only able to spend 1.5 hrs, which wasn't sufficient."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Repurposed as a historical gallery and museum as it holds historical significance as the place of the British surrender during WW2. The artefacts are plenty and professionally curated to tell not only how and why the war efforts failed, details of the surrender negotiations, and also contains exhibits that offer perspectives about how life in Singapore is like during the 1930s before the war. It's a good place to get acquainted with history quickly and comprehensively."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"If you are fan of Singapore history this place is must visit place.
A lot of interesting history has been preserved in this building. And free guided tours are available upon request. Guide was a volunteer but she was really knowledgeable and willing to talk about the museum and history.
For your information, Singaporean are free admission but other nationality you have to pay 3 SGD per person. They accepted card payment as well."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Informative exhibition. Artifacts on show and the history of the building, its function as a ford motorcar factory and subsequently used by the Japanese Army during WWII was an immersive experience."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,How is this place not better known/advertised!? Been in Singapore 8 years and found it only recently. We were the only visitors on a public holiday - its an excellent museum and is free for Singaporeans/PR and only $3 for foreigners. Well worth the visit.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"One of the best museums in Singapore.  Very well presented.  I wish this was in a more central location so more would learn of the atrocities by the Japanese, and the resistance against them. When I left, it was raining, and a very kind staff even gave me an umbrella !  A star care and service.   More visitors need to con here.  Can combine it with Bukit Timah nature reserve"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Very interesting museum , with lots of WW2 information. The guides are extremely helpful, and even provide shawls for visitors to use in the very well air conditioned museum rooms!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,World War II Museum. Worth visiting and getting to know what it was all about. Lots of pictures to recapture back in the 2nd World War. Feel blessed that we don't have to go through that. For non residence we have to pay $3 to get in.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Lovely historical place
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A well maintained place tell us about Singapore during Japanese war ll.
Lucky that we in time for a guided tour."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"$3 entry for foreigners (as in Jan 2020). Sharing some contents with National Museum in History Gallery and Surviving Syonan. However, it's much cheaper than the National Museum."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Glad this iconic building, where the British surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army, has not been turned into a condominium plot. It now houses the World War II exhibition Surviving the Japanese Occupation: War and its Legacies, which presents the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation, and the legacies of the war. Certainly worth a visit."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great layout and air conditioned. Clean toilets. Water cooler is under wraps due to Covid 19 situation. Free for Singapore Citizens (Bring NRIC for free entry).
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Had a pleasant surprise as had initially thought that the museum was small but its not. Clear presentation of exhibits which were well preserved. In school we were taught that Japs used a lot of propaganda during the occupation, but learned that the British also did the same thing and equally ridiculous lol. The only entrance (because of COVID) are two flights of stairs so may not be convenient for those with mobility issues. Didn't see any lifts around."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"History comes alive. Especially for those born after WW2, there's lots to learn and have feel of the sense of hardships and sufferings and oppression by the invaders."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Free Museum tour of Singapore History during WW2.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,This place really tells us about WWII and it is all preserved quite well
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,It's a nice historical museum about Singapore and Malaysia during the colonial years and the Japanese occupation. Make sure to bring with you an extra layer of clothes since the rooms are very cold. Entrance is 3 SGD and payment is by card or nets only.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Very informative exhibits, worth a visit. Free entry for all Singaporeans"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Great museum, cheap for foreigners as well. Short and sweet"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"After the recent renovations, the utilisation of tech to tell the stories has increased much. A very informative walk through the Japanese occupation. Air-conditioning is rather cold if there isn't a crowd of people."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good for history.Especially for our younger generation
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,For those interested in WWII military history this is a great little museum. The museum takes about 30mins to 1hour to see all.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"The great museum, you can use your smartphone to see from the other side (Augmented Reality) for each items of the museum."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very informative. Gives you a glimpse of wartime Singapore.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Best place for gaining an in depth understanding of our country's history during the war. Tours are very interactive and guides are very knowledgeable.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,A historical place where British surrendered Singapore to Japanese during the second world war. The former Ford factory has since turned into a heritage centre with information and exhibits on the war and Japanese occupation. Tour guide is available and provides good information. Highly recommended for tourists.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Informative, simple and very good to let the children learn about the history of Singapore's WW2 history. Don't forget to visit the garden!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Nice collection of exhibits showing the pre and post occupation of Singapore during WWII.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Finally I get to visit ford factory. It was always seem to be closed since covid19 started. Is a great place to relive what our grandparents has to go through during the japanese occupation. I suggest everyone to visits this place since it is free now for Singaporean and PR, you never know when this government will decide to charge per entry."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A real hidden gem, can't believe it's not mentioned in either lonely planet or berlitz guidebooks.  Well worth visiting & very informative.  Mr Leon is great & will give an introduction for you."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Nice museum if you want to know about Singapore's history
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Worth while look round if you are near by. Probably not the best for small kids. A lot of reading. But only $3 to get in.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,An interesting heritage site that's been converted into a small WWII museum. There are two wings which are very well air conditioned. Good relief from the heat and humidity after a walk in the park behind.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great place to know the past of Singapore.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Amazing unknown and hidden museum of Singapore. Great overview of Singapore before and during the war. Events are described rather objectively and there is much to learn in every section. Great location in the old Ford Factory. Highly recommend !
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Great place to learn more about World War 2.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Really well curated museum off the beaten road. Offers an in-depth look at Singapore's story during World War 2 through oral histories and site-specific documents/artefacts. Recently added AR/VR feature that's really neat!
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very informative museum. It's important to know about the history of Japanese occupation in Singapore. The museum is very interesting the visit is short and the team is very welcoming and knowledgeable.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great place for anyone looking to learn about Singapore's place in WWII. It has a lot of information and even stuff like the setting for the British surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Lots of info about what life was like for the locals. Also it isn't too graphic (which some war museums can be) so you can take the kids.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Good museum to stop by for WW2 history buffs.
Well maintained exhibits but the air conditioning can be chilly."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"See once, probably no need for repeat visit. It's a small place, you can be done with all the exhibits in under 2 hours even if you go through them very thoroughly. Mostly static displays, with some multimedia and interactive kiosks. Air-conditioning is really cold, and while they have shawls available to loan, I thought they ought to have just fixed the over-zealous cooling."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,great coverage of SG history around WW time..however wish there was some more coverage of the actual ford factory  and car making around that time
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great! Informative WWII stuff. Register before coming during covid to avoid disappointment. Less parking lot than usual opened. Recommend to visit nearby Bukit Batok park+quarry lake and memorial
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"The makeover of the Former Ford Factory carried out over the most of 2017 seemed to have borne fruit. Working with a space constraint, yet the curators managed to develop a coherent story that charts the history of Singapore from the beginning of the Japanese invasion in 1942 to the Japanese Occupation and the subsequent post war problems generated by the Occupation in the space allocated. The museum docents are also very friendly are are more than willing to go the extra mile to explain to the visitors the significance of the various artefacts presented.  We  totally lost track of time and you could end up spending nearly two hours in the museum if you are keenly interested in the way people coped with the Japanese occupation and how it contributed to the development of the national pysche of the nation."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Know national sorrow for the lives lost and face the future with confidence
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Historically rich! Highly recommend for primary kids to learn more abt Singapore 's history
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,History. This is where British surrendered to Japanese during the occupation in World War 2. Singapore was then known as Syonan-to.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Nice museum to bring the kids to understand Singapore pre and post WW2. Staffs were very friendly and kind. Spent longer than expected browsing through all the exhibits.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"If u wanna know about Sg history especially WWII, come here! And note that his museum has nothing about Ford, they donated this place for exhibition only. Don't come here to look for Ford!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Contains informative exhibits on ww2.
Received free ""limited edition"" ang pao packets.
Nothing related to car manufacturing or Ford here."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Good place and the rice with potatoes tasted nice. Happy that I got to go
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This place tell you about story during Japanese occupation before and after. Very good explanation for the person who wants to know what Singapore look like before and after.
Bring a sweater, inside the museum like in the refrigerator."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"The newly revamped experience is great for kids and family, including real oral history stories, facts and videos that makes it memorable and wakes you to the reality of war."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Must visit for those interested in historical events. War and post war Singapore is displayed with utmost detail.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Finally paid a visit only after almost 9 years living in Singapore. It's a good Sunday activity for people who have ""been there, done that""."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great collection of pre and post war exhibits giving context to the local environment during that period.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Where history comes to live. Definitely made better w a guide.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A modern, well-organized museum that contains an important part of the local history, and made cooler by the fact that it is located in the original site of British surrender. Offers a glimpse into the occupation period of Singapore in WW2 from the angle of various nationalities such as the British, Australians, Indians, Malays, Chinese and Japanese. Free admission for all Singaporeans, but very cheap for foreigners too."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Excellent small museum of the surrender to the Japanese in WW II and life during the occupation.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Went to the former former ford factory it was nice and the new former ford factory was nicer than former former ford factory. Haha that's a mouthful.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This is a fabulous museum with a very rich permanent exhibition covering the period of Japanese rule over Singapore. Citizens and PR enter for free, non residents pay only $3. The period of Singapore history covered by the exhibition is very underrated, and as such you will certainly learn a lot that you did not previously know. The museum, which is inside the former Ford factory, is also extremely well kept. We joined the 15:30 free guided tour led by an extremely knowledgeable volunteer who experienced the impact and aftermath of the Japanese occupation firsthand. Definitely one of the best museums in Singapore!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,it was renovated in february 2017. one of the best places to learn about lofe during Japanese occupation of singapore
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"After a year-long revamp, the former Ford Motor Factory along Upper Bukit Timah Road has finally reopened its doors to invited guests on 15 February 2017.

Renamed Syonan Gallery, its opening was aptly timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore.

A highlight of the private event was a weapon presentation ceremony, where recruits from the 2nd Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (2 SIR) received their Singapore Assault Rifle (SAR) 21.

I think there is a significant meaning to hold the weapon presentation ceremony at the very site where the British Armed Forces surrendered unconditionally to the Imperial Japanese Army in 1945.

I am only able to pay a visit to the museum on the second day when it  is opened to the public."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good place to learn about the period when Singapore was under Japanese rule. Lots of other things to do nearby (within a few bus stops) too!
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,great for people interested to find out about the atrocities and the lesser known details of the japanese occupation in singapore with supporting information about ww2 in general
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Quiet and charming place.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,2,"Boring, even for a history lover... Exhibits were messy and piece-meal without a flowing theme."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"A World War II exhibition housed at the Former Ford Factory building has been changed.

Former Ford Factory (The Syonan Gallery) has changed its name on 17Feb2017.

Syonan Gallery: War and its Legacies will now be called Surviving the Japanese Occupation: War and its Legacies.

Last update/ review Feb2017."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"You get to learn about British surrendered to the Japanese. Apart from that, there isnt much here."

Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good place to learn about the history of the Ford factory
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,A nice place to visit but lack of publicity to induce local crowd
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good place to spend 2hrs there
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,It has a very detailed gallery filled with Singapore's past from the Japanese Occupation. It is very educational and very good just to visit to learn more about Singapore's past. I would recommend going here as it is actually one of the best museums I have visited.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"After taking a long time to find a taxi willing to go out to Bukit Timah, I arrived at the gallery about ten minutes before closing. The kind gentleman working there let me in for free, and told me to come back some other time for a longer visit. I went around taking pictures of each exhibit so I could learn at my own leisure. The guy even called another taxi for me at closing time. Top notch!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This is the best museum I have visited in Singapore so far. It has a very extensive collections of historical archives. Will definitely visit again and will recommend to all my friends.

Free for residents and $3 for non-residents.

Guided tour was not available due to the COVID-19 situation. You will have to book a visit slot (1hr 15mins and max 25 pax per slot, starting from 11am, though I stayed much longer as there was so much to see)."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,Small but interesting exhibit. Mainly on WW2 n post war exhibits.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Can be better spiced up to make it more attractive for locals and tourist
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,It's great museum for the history fanatics showing how life was back in the day
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Mostly involved with the Japanese occupation of Singapore and Malaya. Should be a good place to start for those who want to know more about the nation’s history
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Truly amazing museum! One of the best I have been at.
We had a great guide, Nicholas, who is working there as a volunteer. The museum is about the history of the young Singaporean nation. From the years before WW2 up until the cold war. To understand Singapore, you must visit this museum!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Interesting historical location with comprehensive thought provoking displays. Take in a guided tour with one of the knowledgable volunteers if you can. Be warned the displays area is cold take one of the shawls they have on offer at no cost.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,15 February 1942.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Well worth the $3 entry fee but not suitable for kids. Great place for history buffs
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This Former Ford Factory is not really about the Ford vehicle manufacturer, it's all about the history of Singapore during Japanese invasion.
The exhibition here is great, lot of information and easy to understand.  And as this museum is only focusing on Japanese occupation, you will at least have something learned for that period. Compare with massive of data, this one is more focusing and easy to understand the situation during that moment.
They also have staff explain to you in person, you will need to check the schedule on site.
Don't forget to check out the building after visited the exhibition, as it is a classical building indeed"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Great museum with friendly staff.
Excellent place to learn about the history of Singapore during the war and the daily life of Singaporeans during the Japanese occupation. Download their app to get extra details and access interactive sections."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,A lot of insights gleaned from the sharing by your guides
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Good history of WW2 and the Japanese occupation
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very meaningful display on WW2.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Great educational tour. Only issue is the air-conditioning. It was way toooo cold. There's a scarf to borrow from, but for young kids I would suggest a jacket for them."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Immersive experience of the pre and post WW2 period, with many personal accounts"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,This is a historical site for Singapore. This is where the British surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Army in 1942. It is essentially a museum to take you back in time during WWII. Educational and Air conditioned. Free parking too.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Not big, 30 mins tour, educational for kids to know about world war 2 actual fact history"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,2,"I Am Rating This A 2 Stars Because Of It's Friendly Staff And Nice Facilities And Exhibitions Are Well Detailed 😍.

The Other Reason I Am Rating It A 2 Stars Is Because I've Been There When I Was 8-9 Years Old.

(My Child Centre At The Time Bring Me To This Place Formerly Known As Old Ford Factory, Due To The Scenes Of The Japanese People Attacking The Villagers Showned And The Creepy Music Playing In The Background, I Ended Up Being Scared For 1 year+.)

But I Would Recommend You NOT To Take Your Your Children Under The Age Of 11 Or 12 To Go There Because I Was Afraid That Your Child Will Be Scared And Can't Sleep At Night 😇😖."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Great little museum that I totally missed on my many to trips to Singapore until now as it doesn't seem very widely known.  It isn't huge but there is a lot of information here and everything is documented in a very interesting way giving multiple sides to a lot of the stories from the time of the Japanese occupation.  It's also great to have this told in a setting like this with a real history rather than just a random building.

Very cheap so great value.  I don't think it's as cold inside as people are saying but they have blankets you can borrow for free if you aren't used to cooler temperatures or find it hard to adjust to the change from the heat outside."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Excellent museum. Well maintained and informative. 2 things to note. The entrance fee of 3 dollars has to paid by CARD. They don't accept cash.

Also it is very cold inside which is great for about 30 minutes but then gets a bit chilly.

Well worth a visit."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very good coverage of the WW2 era in Singapore and what life was like during it. Also shared some important insight on post WW2 life and links to modern Singapore as well. Good experience + there's usually not many people. Scarves can be collected at the counter as it can get a tad too cold
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Fascinating place detailing pre war, the invasion by Japan, the boardroom of the former Ford factory where the surrender document was signed.  Insights into life during the occupation and after Singapore was liberated and how society changed. Alas not very well advertised or signposted but definitely worth a visit. Very cheap admission. No cafe."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This is a wonderful, fascinating, well-currated museum. The walking tour is especially great, I wouldn't miss it."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,A very interesting part of Singapore to learn about the war history. It is however over airconditioned.They do provide shawls but it would be better to raise the temperature.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Great museum with awesome volunteer guide - Nicholas. We learnt a lot from the stories he shared and the whole session was very engaging and informative. We didn’t expect this museum to be this good and very pleased with our decision to come even though it’s a bit out of the way. If you like history, make sure you give this place a visit!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Highly recommend especially the guided tour. Conducted by volunteer guides who are clearly enthusiastic and passionate about the tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and also very dedicated. Although tours usually last an hour, he took almost 2hr to walk us through the whole exhibition and never once showing any tiredness. Instead he kept apologizing for “holding us up”. I feel bad that I didn’t get his name but thank you so much for the tour if you are reading this."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,I learnt something new about Singapore History
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,This place has a rich history of Singapore. You must join the daily 2:30pm tour. Francis is an excellent tour guide and we enjoyed his tour today.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,The place is pretty small but yet packs in the whole history of Japanese Occupation
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Wonderful place to discover Singapore's history away from the usual crowd. But come prepared because brrrr... . This is winter in Singapore. The air conditioning is on at full blast.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A nice small spot to end your hikes seeing how it's in the middle of a couple of hike routes.

Very informative meseum with tons of relics from World War II in Singapore (and what it led to).

Staff and volunteers here are amazingly nice. Guided tours are done every hour on weekends."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Really good take on WW2 from a Singapore POV. Slightly out of the way, but it made for a good 2 hours of wandering around and watching old WW2 footage."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Fascinating history lesson.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Much better than we expected
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"The Japanese evacuation 1942-1945 is one of the Nations darkest times. As a British colony S‘pore depended on the defence strategy of the British which failed swiftly. This Former Ford Factory was the japanese headquarter and the exact place were the British signed the unconditional surrender agreement. The museum showcases very well the time before, during and after this period.

A bitter day to remember is the 15.2.1942, known as the Fall (or Battle) of Singapore! At this day after 8 days of intense fighting British Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival signed the unconditional surrender to the Japanese 25th Army led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford factory in Bukit Timah.
The British had with 85000 Troops at least double the forces on their side but it turned into the largest surrender of British troops in history!
Renamed Syonan, Singapore as a Japanese colony until 1945 experienced an extremely difficult period especially for the Chinese population.
The Japanese offensive into the South China Sea started on 8th December 1941 (identically with the Pearl Harbor attack). They entered via Thailand, granting them free passage and captured Malaya and Singapore thereafter.
The Former Ford Factory is now a very interesting Museum!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Nice exhibition to go back in time and learn about the war and its effects on Singapore
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Very informative. Good place to leard about the period of Japanese war in Singapore and how Singapore came to be. Very educational and a good place to visit for school learning journeys
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A cool place to go to learn about the loss of WW2 and the Jap Occupation.

Will take my friends and family there if you're willing to learn and explore. Many interactive platforms. Good for kids too."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Not a huge place, but well organized exhibits. The guide tour was excellent, the guide provided stories and added personal experiences too. It was a 1.5 hour talk. No Café on-site, just a drinks vending machine."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This place is a great and detailed museum explaining about the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. The explanations are clear, and there are many pictures and interactive exhibits to help visitors learn more. This musuem is highly recommended!"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"Interesting history of japanese era but museum is too cold, jacket not good enough. May need thick pullover"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,An important chapter of Singapore's history. Wear something warm - air conditioning is strong here.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"I was impressed by the photo and relic showcases in this museum which capture the key stages of atmosphere prior to and during the fall of Singapore during WW2 and post war Singapore. After the visit, I left with a lingering feeling of despondency over how people like my forefathers went through difficult times.
There are ample parking spaces as there are not many visitors including locals and British tourists. With the aid of google map, you can take most buses at the bus stop along Upper Bukit Timah Rd after you exit from Bukit Panjang MRT station."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Very informative
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Full of historic information on WW2 and British's surrender of Singapore. I would advise those who are visiting to bring a jacket as it is cold but they do provide free scarfs to be used in the vicinity.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Those who is interested in Spores history especially why and how the Japanese won and later lost her war in S E Asia must visit at least once.
There should be a canteen/ cafe for this place to excell. Now it is just another dull musesum."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"Some of the rooms are VERY cold, and they provide scarves... For airconditioning... A good museum overall though with some very interesting things."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Educational place for kids and adults
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"So much history, in such a simple unassuming factory shade"

Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Great place to learn about the dark history of Singapore. Join the guided tour of you can. Definitely worth a visit.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Cool . Enriching. But definitely bring a sweater cause it can get very cold
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,A beautifully crafted museum that shows Singapore's history.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"A good pictorial account of Singaporeans Surviving the Japanese Occupation: War and its legacies at former Ford Factory. For those of us born after the war, this exhibition helps to understand our history. The events and interviews tell us about the frightening memories and experiences of the people in this traumatic period. The grounds include a garden showing the food crops consumed by the people for survival, like bananas, tapioca and sweet potatoes."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Excellent museum! Just make sure to bring a jacket, it's cold inside?"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"The Former Ford Factory gave us a glimpse to the past during the dark days of Singapore; where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese by the British.

I was struck by a quote which goes something like this ""We forgive but we don't forget, we learn from history and so that we don't have to forgive again.""

War is a terrible thing and should not be used to solve problems, especially when life is involved. Hopefully people learn to cherish the things they have and not forget things don't come easy as they are now compared to the past."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"The former factory is a significant landmark rich in history. Unfortunately the museum there doesn’t do it justice. The museum focuses on the British and Japanese occupations and war. It is a very small exhibit contained in a tiny area, and most of the old building is off limits. Also a lot of the exhibit contains text and pictures rather than artefacts. I could go online if I want to see text and pictures or read about the war. Also being that the museum is in a former car factory, it would be nice if they could also have an exhibit about the history of car manufacturing in Singapore. They don’t. I wish the exhibit was larger with more artefacts, and I also wish it contained more information about the factory itself and car manufacturing. As a non permanent resident, I had to pay $3 which is a very reasonable price. I think PR and citizens are free. But $3 won’t break the bank and I can’t complain about the price. Also last time I was here, the place closes on Mondays. Google hasn’t updated the hours yet. Make sure you go directly to the website to double check the days and hours of operation."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Less we forget! Well designed exhibits. Guided tours. Well worth taking time to visit. We must learn the lessons of history or be doomed to repeat the mistakes
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Visited it before renovations. Good preservation of building and the famous conference room where the British surrender took place.
Historically significant as it represented the worst defeat of the British army and the fall of Singapore.
However, the low profile and isolation of the place belies its importance."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Excellent place. Fills an important gap telling our war time  history. Highly recommended for locals and tourists alike!
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,I want to visit again as I never got the chance to go thru all the display.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"This will bring you down the history of former ford factory and World War Two. When I went, one kind gentleman patiently explained to us as we walked through the museum. It was fun to learn about it and definitely must go."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,Staff and guide are good..except A/C is too cold
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"Very educational and eye opening, nice clean toilets"
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"An impressive effort that keeps Singapore’s and the former Ford Factory’s stories in tact. Although located at an exclusive area at Upper Bukit Timah, it sure worths your efforts to be there for a short but enriching learning journey of the past."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Nice place. Able to learn about Singapore history during the world war 2.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Good experience. Exhibit design could be better. Dull the layout. The history of Singapore well displayed.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good place
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Museum detailing the Japanese Malayan campaign and the fall of Singapore. The room where the british surrendered is also displayed. Free for locals and just $3 for everyone else. Guided tours are available at certain timeslots, total time to complete the exhibit should take around 20mins to no more than an hour."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,great historical place. its a bit far from mrt
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Exhibits are world class, and surrounding area is well landscaped. Only comment is that indoor areas are cold, and temperature control can be better."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Excellent displays about a dark but ultimately triumphant moment in Singapore history. Worth seeking out.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"it's nice to see the history of Singapore, with the separation and the road to independence. However, if you are planning to go there, it's going to be quite cold so remember to pack a jacket with you :)"

Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"Really interesting guided tour, if you are listening closely. Thank you to my guide, Chai! A lot of info to take in... gives you a sweeping picture of Singapore during WWII. I learned a lot."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,3,"The exhibits were mainly old newspaper clippings from the period of the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Not much artefacts though. Some of the labels of the exhibits were peeling off, clearly more maintenance is needed. The 25 minute documentary that I watched in the AV room was quite informative, but you have to ask at the counter in order to view it."
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,Was OK.
Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,Good place to learn about Japanese attacks on world war 2. Nothing to do with cars.   I went to see some old Ford cars but it's all about world war 2. Need to pay $3 foreigners.

Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,5,"(Translated by Google) It is the first Ford Motor Company factory built in Southeast Asia, where the British army surrendered to the Japanese military. Singapore citizens and permanent residents are free, and tourists pay an entrance fee of $3. The process of the British return to rule after the Japanese occupation and Japanese defeat during World War II was well exhibited, which helped a lot in understanding the history. You can enter by reservation at each time slot, and there is also a small parking lot so you can enjoy a comfortable view. I learned that Singapore produced cars and exported them to Southeast Asia.

Old Ford Factory Singapore Museum,4,"(Translated by Google) War History Memorial in Bukit Timah. It was named Old Ford Factory before it was renovated in February 2017. It is the so-called ""old Ford factory"".

Immediately after the refurbishment, the name ""Syonan Gallery"" was scheduled to be given, but due to the unexpected reaction to the surroundings, it was changed to the current Former Ford Factory.

A replica of the meeting between General Yamashita and Lieutenant General Percival is on display in the hall (the actual venue was also the meeting room used by the executives of the Ford Factory). Photography is OK.

Before the renovation, there seemed to be many pictures that showed how cruel Japanese soldiers were doing, but after the renovation, there are relatively few such shocking exhibits.

If you are interested in such historical facts related to war, we recommend you to visit.

ブキティマにある戦争歴史記念館です。2017年2月に改装を行う前はOld Ford Factoryという名称でした。所謂「旧フォード工場」です。

改装終了直後には「Syonan Gallery」という名称が付く予定でしたが、周囲の反響が予想以上に大きく、現在のFormer Ford Factoryへと変更となりました。

館内には山下将軍とパーシバル中将との会談の際のレプリカが展示されています(実際の会場もフォード工場の重役の方が使っていた会議室だったとの事)館内はフラッシュをたかなければ写真撮影はOKです。

改装前は日本兵がいかに残虐な事をしてきたかが分かる様な写真が多かった様ですが、改装後は比較的そういったショッキングな展示は少なくなっているとの事です。

こういった戦争関連の史実に興味がある方は一度見に行かれる事をお勧めします。"

Singaporeans are free, foreigners have a small admission fee. You cannot use cash only with a credit card or electronic payment.

There are many Japanese documents at the time when Japan ruled Singapore as Shonan Island, and it makes me think a lot.

The nearby site of the Shonan Chureito Pagoda is within walking distance. The Japanese army erected a pilgrimage tower to worship soldiers who died in the battlefield after the occupation of Singapore. Currently, only the approach remains. A radio tower now stands at the place where the Chureito was located.

日本がシンガポールを昭南島として統治していた当時の日本語の資料も多く、いろいろ考えさせられます。

近く(徒歩圏)には、昭南忠霊塔跡地があります。日本軍がシンガポール占領後、激戦地であったこの場所に戦死した兵士を祀る忠霊塔を建立しました。現在は、参道のみが残ります。忠霊塔のあった場所には今では電波塔が立っています。"

Some interactive exhibits as well. For me, the most interesting was a model of the city that shows not only the buildings that already exist but also those that are under construction (in yellow in the photos) and those that will be built in years to come (in white)"

The foresight and thought process of how far ahead the planning is done. Worth a visit. Now with COVID-19 measures, you’ll just need to book in advance before you head down."
Singapore City Gallery,4,"It's a fairly good way to spend about 1.5 - 2 hours if you're already in the area hoping to burn some time.

There were a couple of interactive and visually appealing exhibits available. The on site ambassador/guide were very keen to share interesting information and facts about the city's development over the years and how the city might look in the future.

While this was a very worthwhile visit, especially it being free, it's hard to justify planning a trip just for this. But it's location makes it easy to plan the next activity."
Singapore City Gallery,5,"Free gallery exploring the development of Singapore as a city. It's definitely worth a visit. The models of the city are superb and so detailed. They have several exhibitions, and their permanent gallery has high amounts of technology implementation and interactivity.

But went there around 4:20pm le so no time to explore future."
Singapore City Gallery,5,"A lovely building. We only saw the ground floor, but it was fill with architectural models and very informative, interesting explanations about Singapore."

Singapore City Gallery,5,"If you are a tourist, this place is a must visit ! Learning about a country's past is interesting, but what is more important is how we take those insights to mould our future. The city gallery will provide you with the necessary information on how Singapore is shaping the city and what are the future plans ahead for the country.

For Singaporeans, I also urge you to visit this place to understand your physical surroundings. Many of us live in this country but have never opened our eyes to see what it really is - it's past, present and future. The city gallery summarises all of those for you to browse leisurely.

Take a guided tour of this place, it happens every week on Tuesdays and Thursday, 11 am and 1230 pm as well as every third Saturday of the month. Each tour is only 1 hour and totally free of charge.

Gallery is nice, many models, informative videos some focus on the past. To my taste though the general feel there a little bit too lofty. Maybe that's because of the short history of Singapore. Us Europeans are a bit more relaxed about our achievements meanwhile. Still, to some extent, we can learn quite a bit from that attitude, that still encourages individuals to make a change for the good."

Changi Museum Singapore,5,Every child . Should go at least once in a life time.
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Beautiful renovation, wonderful staff. Make sure you get a (free) guided tour, the staff have many stories to share."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,Very well done and interesting but lacking in an authentic feel that I was hoping for.
Changi Museum Singapore,5,A place to treasure peace
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Nice and quiet place to reflect upon our history. Recent upgrades to the exhibits have made this place more aligned to other upgraded museums e.g. Spore Discovery Centre
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Friendly staff and museum is newly renovated with new artifacts and exhibits
Changi Museum Singapore,5,There are many interesting things to watch there
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Newly refurbished, Changi Museum is a great place to learn about the experience of POWs during the Japanese occupation in Singapore.  The staff are friendly and helpful too."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Awesome place for a historical piece of Singapore, the life of a POW n how Changi has been of such significance."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"The exhibits provided a nice summary of how life was like during WWII from the perspective of the locals, the Australians and the British. It showcased the innovativeness of the people during the war, and also how art / music played a part in lifting the spirits of the people. A replica of St. Luke's chapel is present with the 5 murals recreated. A wonderful tribute to all those who died fearlessly during the war."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Small but interesting museum. Can be easily reachable using bus. Couple of hours will be enough. All the articles and stuff are related to the world war two experience in Singapore.

If you wanna know about the history and how Singapore survive the war you must visit this place. Closes at 5PM. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is a small outlet to buy books or souvenirs. There are paid audio tours.

I feel really proud when seeing the how Singapore is now after seeing how it was there after the world war."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"A deep past that has many different interpretations.

Some i talked to argued about life in the past. Some argued about how the prisoners should have been allowed home instead of being captive. Some even argued that some prisoners are innocent nonetheless.

But re-visitng this chapel gave a deeper insight. We felt that the chapel and museum was a place of solace and peace. Where some destined to live their lives til death.

Acceptance.

I shant dwell to much since the places brings forth different views. The place is very well maintained, clean and is really a place to visit. Although it might not be convenient for some, it is worth to visit d past to better understand d present for the future.

The venue also has a cafe for those who are hungry. Ohya , its not halal though. Nonetheless, come on and make a walk down the path of history along with ur family.

Cheers!!

Changi Museum Singapore,3,It’s closed - no notice on it as to when redevelopment which started in Jan 2019 will be finished
Changi Museum Singapore,5,There is nothing pleasant about the exhibits at the Changi Museum which tells the story of the horrors that the prisoners of war suffered under the Japanese during the occupation of Singapore. It is well worth it; however.
Changi Museum Singapore,1,Closed for refurbishment until some point in 2020. Everything looks like it is still in place and gentlemen was still there sat behind closed gate reading his newspaper but will not let you in. And not much else in the area to visit. Was a long wasted journey from the city
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"A quaint, almost surreal chapel in Changi, marking the history of war past"
Changi Museum Singapore,2,"Unfortunately this was closed when we went even though the website said it was opened great little restaurant next door, which was lovely surprise."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,Nice museum commemorating prisoners of war in Singapore in the second world war. They offer audio tours as well. Well done for such a small museum.
Changi Museum Singapore,1,"Both my two sons and I are very disappointed.
We checked the night before from the website that says it is open. Woke up travelled all the way from Jurong Pioneer area to Changi, only to find out that it is closed for renovation. Very badly managed, tourists who travelled all the way there and find it close will leave a very bad impression on the management of the place."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,This tiny chapel is worth a visit
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Such a pieceful place with historical notes
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Hard to face this but it's ever harder to understand how can human treat others this way!
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"A small museum with World War II history of Singapore during Japanese Occupation.
You can go on museum's Audio tours by using audio sets with Regular rate at S$8.00/adult and S$4.00/child.
Note: You can't take photos inside the museum. Only can take photos outside the museum."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Beautiful building.
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Lovely
Changi Museum Singapore,4,small historical chapel
Changi Museum Singapore,3,it is expected to be reopened in late May 2021
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Very well designed and laid out with some moving accounts of WWII memorabilia. Be prepared to spend a minimum of half a day here.
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"A good view of Singapore under occupation.

Small museum. About 30 displays. 75% are quite interesting. Headphones are available for a self guided tour. I went without and my companion used them. If you don't mind reading lots of text, it's ok to go without headphones and the experience is good, almost emotional.

Story is told from an Australian / New Zealand / local perspective. British story is somewhat lacking, rather like their response at the time. Very small section from Japanese perspective is the most telling of all and gives great insight to the war in the east.

Very clean and somber.

Takes no more than two hours to get through it all."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"I did it again, closed for reforms until the end of 2020"
Changi Museum Singapore,3,"We visited here after the Battle box. It doesn't compare really. This museum had a lot of reading, although there was also an audio tour on offer. The display were memories of people who had been interred as prisoners of war. It was insightful and I really enjoyed seeing the paintings done by inmates with limited materials. No photos inside."
Changi Museum Singapore,1,"Changi Chapel & Museum are closed for renovation works until 2020. There is currently no forecast for its reopening to the public. If you are already here, you can visit the nearby Changi Village or Changi Jewel."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"Not as big as I was expecting and fairly simple but still lots of good information. If you're interested in the subject matter, try to also watch the Changi dramatic mini series made by ABC Australia which I thought was very good and thought provoking. The Battlebox museum and tour (in Singapore) also overlaps with the information here regarding the events leading up to the surrender so that's worth doing as well. They have audio guides available for $8 which take you through nicely."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"Good museums tell good stories, and this place has a big story that crosses many divides. It offers a wide ranging perspective on the invasion of Singapore and its subsequent impact on the people who were caught up in the events. Changi has an infamous role in the occupation of Singapore, but it is viewed as part of a bigger story, that weaves the experience of the inmates of Changi prison, with ordinary Singaporeans. Any visit will be enhanced with the excellent audio tour equipment offered by the museum."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,I really liked going here to the chapel and museum.  Lots of fascinating facts and insights.  I believe the museum is curently closed for renovations for a couple of years until sometime in 2020 which is a shame.  Not sure why it is taking so long.  It is a bit out of the way but worth the visit when it reopens for sure.
Changi Museum Singapore,3,A small museum to know about Singapore history
Changi Museum Singapore,1,"The MUSEUM and CHAPEL are CLOSED until 2020 or 2021 for refurbishment.  !!!!!!!
You can't get in, and can't see anything.
I couldn't find a way to mark it as closed by edit update.
Google - please help other tourists not make the 1 hour journey out to this location pointlessly."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Great museum. Closed for renovations. The murals were marvellous. Australian friends whose ancestors fought in Singapore loved it.
Changi Museum Singapore,5,Great museum commemorating those interred by the Japanese in the second World War.  Very moving displays that give a very personal insite to the invasion of Singapore.  Strongly recommend a visit whilst visiting Singapore. The best way to get there  is to catch a taxi.
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Is a very small but powerful museum. Being a Brit, we never really learn about this side of the Second World War over here, so it was incredibly heart wrenching and interesting to find out more. It's a bit far out so advise a taxi, but you only need maybe 60-90 mins here due to its size."

Changi Museum Singapore,5,"I cannot say that this was a pleasant experience: the subject matter is anything but. However, it gave me a much greater understanding of the historical perspective of some aspects of Singapore. Educational and very worthwhile."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,A very humbling experience. The exhibits remind us that everyone suffers during a war. I would give it 5 stars if not for the uninterested and unmotivating staff. The museum will be undergoing reno soon so hopefully new and better-trained staff be on hand then.
Changi Museum Singapore,1,"For info, from April 2nd 2018 to 2020, museum is closed for renovation.

Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Giving the detail of sad period of history during WWII and also showing the resilience of people and POw during that area. Although the display is good and free, I recommend to rent the audio tour gadget."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"Could be pretty difficult to find the place, if travelling via public transport. Though once you reach the place, it is definitely a great place to learn more about Singapore's past."
Changi Museum Singapore,1,Chapel open but Museum closed for renovations until 2020. Would have been nice to have known this before making the trek out there!
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"The small chapel, even though not air-conditioned, is surprisingly quiet and serene. The museum collections are moving, in par with the more popular Old Ford Factory."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"Well worth a visit & making the journey out to the west of the island. Small museum & chapel, which explains a lot of the history."
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"Moving experience. Its a small museum, never crowded. Take your time and immerse yourself in reading all the stories."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"The museum size is not that big, but you can still see some history and feel the atmosphere of the war there, their white chapel is really a good place for you to have a self-moment in life to enjoy."

Changi Museum Singapore,5,Its closed for renovations at the moment. Just got in before and would recommend it for the history and moving experience.

Dated : 05/06/2018 ( Tuesday )."
Changi Museum Singapore,4,"The museum takes the visitors along a painful period in Singapore's past and Changi's  links during those dark days.

The displays are thoughtfully laid out, with contributions from survivors of the atrocities. It was a sombre feeling to be walking around the museum. Entrance is free of charge and the staff are very nice."

Changi Museum Singapore,5,"(Translated by Google) The Changi Chapel and Museum reopened this year. In addition to the original Changi Chapel, there is also a rebuilt museum. There are 8 themed exhibition areas in the museum, which record from a different perspective the thousands of them during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in 1942. Ten thousand prisoners of war and civilians were imprisoned in the Changi POW camp. During the three and a half years of captivity, how did they survive with their extraordinary wit and tenacity?

(Original)
樟宜小教堂和博物馆在今年重新开放，除了原有的樟宜礼拜堂外，还有重新修建的博物馆，博物馆里面8个主题展区，以不同的角度记录了1942年日军占领新加坡期间，成千上万的战俘和平民被关押在樟宜战俘营，在这囚禁的三年半里，他们如何凭着过人的机智和坚韧的精神活下来的。"

Changi Museum Singapore,3,"(Translated by Google) It's one of the places that Japanese people living in Singapore should say. It clearly describes what the wartime Japanese had done in Singapore. Also, it is a fact that Singapore still accepts Japan, so I would like you to visit it.

シンガポールに在住の日本人なら言っておくべき場所の一つです。戦時中の日本人がシンガポールで行ってきたことが鮮明に書かれています。また、それでもなおシンガポールが日本を受け入れていることも事実としてありますので、ぜひとも足を運んでいただきたいです。"
Changi Museum Singapore,5,"(Translated by Google) Changi Museum exhibiting the period of the Japanese occupation of Singapore from the Battle of the Malay Peninsula in World War II. During World War II, many people from all over the world were involved, and many were forced to live a difficult life. However, there is also the ruthless colonial policy of Western countries, and it is important to remember that local people who lived in oppressed colonies have been able to regain their place of living.

In Singapore, the Changi prison that accommodated Westerners during the Japanese occupation. His life there was extreme. In Singapore, this period is also referred to as the Dark Age.

The museum opened on February 15, 2001. It was the anniversary of the fall of Singapore by Japan in 1942. Pictures, paintings, letters from prisoners of war, etc. are on display at the property, and there is also a guided tour through the Changi Museum. The purpose of the museum is to pass on to the younger generation in praise of the wartime disaster of Singapore and the brave fighters in Singapore. This is a place you should definitely visit.

第二次世界大戦のマレー半島の戦いからシンガポール日本占領期について展示するチャンギ博物館。第二次世界大戦は、世界中の多くの人が巻き込まれ、さまに苦渋の生活を強いられた人々が多いです。ただし、欧米諸国の無慈悲な植民地政策というものもあり、虐げられていた植民地に住んでいた現地の人々から自らの生活の場所を取り戻すことができた一面も忘れてはいけないと思います。

シンガポールにおいては、日本占領期に欧米人を収容したチャンギ刑務所。そこでの生活は、過酷を極めたとのこと。シンガポールにおいては、この時期、暗黒時代とも表現しています。

この博物館がオープンしたのは、2001年2月15日のこと。1942年の日本によるシンガポールを陥落させてからの記念日でした。館内には写真、絵画、捕虜がしたためた手紙などが展示されており、チャンギ博物館を巡るガイドツアーもあります。この博物館の目的は、戦時中のシンガポールの惨禍やシンガポールにおける勇敢に闘争をつづける人々を褒め称え、若い世代に語り継ぐものです。ぜひ一度は訪れてほしい場所です。"

"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",1,"very disappointed to be turn away from the center when it gives ridiculous ruling that ALL visitors must email at least 3 days in advance for permission to enter.  Obviously, it does not welcome you as most or other places of interest in Spore require ONLY the usual SAFE entry.  When approached the staff , they could not explain why the place needed such extreme extraordinary Safety Management Measures. I appeal for an exceptional as I travelled all the far east of Singapore to get there but their unfriendly and unempathetic staff could not be bothered.  This pain shall remain inside me for a long long time!!!   I hated this place from the bottom of my heart!!!"

"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Sunset over NTU’s Chinese Heritage Center.
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,The Chinese Heritage Centre (CHC) was founded in 1995 to advance knowledge and understanding of the ethnic Chinese communities
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,Beautiful building and nice history tour
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,Visited it some time back. It's essentially a museum that narrates the history of NTU and the chinese culture. It's worth to drop by when you visit NTU
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,Nice garden with orchid flowers
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,A hidden gem which is a little difficult to get to. But it tells the history of the humble Chinese migrants in Singapore and their unwavering support towards education. Should be better promoted than it is now.
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"I'm a Vietnamese national. I used to hate Chinese, really, due to the Chinese bad influence on us. I went to the Heritage Center and wow! I had a change of heart. I had a different view of Chinese. Very recommended if you are a history lover!"

"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,A very simple display of heritage history n nothing much to view except quiet surrounding.
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,nice place but very quiet....a lot of antiques n not good for kids haha

"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,"Went for the Chinese Museum, which is open on weekend as well. Tour guide is available for extra cost but you can find many interesting fact inside."
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",3,"Pretty boring, it's mostly a descriptive tour. The artifacts are insignificant(maybe it's just I'm spoiled by many other great real museums). Architecture is ok, but nothing extraordinary"
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",4,Looks so antique
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,"The former admin building of Nanyang University, or Nantah. The garden in front was formerly the main garden that Nantah was situated around."
"Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore",5,It's the post-classical Chinese architecture and vibes of old Nantah that makes Nantah and the current ntu unique.

Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Here you can explore the malay roots and culture in Singapore. Its a 2 level museum where in you will be instructed to start from the 2nd level down to level 1. Need to remove your shoes before you enter the exhibit area.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"first time here, visited the ""cat"" exhibition which is ending on 31 May.
super cute. u should visit before it ends."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,Free if you're a citizen. Come here to experience what its like in the past. Its a great place to see whats life like back then and also to remember and appreciate the different cultures of Singapore. Great food nearby too; Arab Street.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Small and quaint museum set in a former Malay palace. You can learn and gain insight about the history and culture of the Malay people here. Staff were very sweet and friendly. I understand that there are guided tours here, which we didn't get to experience this time."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,A unique place of interest. Plenty of Malay heritage and history. I learnt a lot about Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca during the olden days. Worth visiting when you are around the popular Kampong Glam.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"The staff at this center was excellent. They were most friendly and helpful.
The exhibits were interesting and I enjoyed the old ""cinema"" showing snippets of past malay movies.
You are free to walk the ground and garden."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Visited the Malay Heritage centre which is located around the Kampong Glam area in Beach road. This Museum is also walking distance away from Sultan Mosque. Entry is free for Singaporeans and permanent resident. Admission charges applies for foreigner. Location is pretty accessible, walking distance from Bugis Mrt station.

This Museum is a good place if you are keen to learn more about the rich heritage and culture of Singapore’s Malay community. Due to covid 19 situation, some of the interactives and the kids’ corner are currently not available."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Went during the Cat Art event. Pretty cute.

Learnt quite a lot from the Heritage Centre main Museum."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"This is the right place if you want to learn more about the Malay culture. The center is a palace which once was the house of the Sultan. It’s a great place to go if you happen to be in the area, it only takes 45-60min to see everything and it costs 8 SGD if you’re not a SG Citizen/PR. The hands-on interactions are suspended due to the pandemic."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,3,"Museum would interest an older muslim or peranakan crowd. Needs to bundle tickets together w other museums to gather interest. Aircon n lighting needs funding to upgrade, i imagine"
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Amazing place to discover the Malay Heritage. I love the architecture here. Well maintain and staff here are passionate about this place. Recommended for local and tourist alike.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,Interesting place. Covered wide areas of Malay Muslim culture.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,1,"Beware of a pesky tour guide.

My sis and I were there to take photos of the cat exhibition. A Caucasian lady wearing a ""Volunteer"" tag said she would be conducting a guided tour at 2pm that would last about an hour. Joining the tour meant having only 10 minutes to take photos. My sis politely declined. The tour guide offered to give a shorter tour if no one else signed up by 2pm. My sis again politely declined while I walked away.

While taking photos outside, the tour guide came near us. My sis politely told her we won't have time for the tour as we wanted to take photos of the cat exhibition. Her reply was ""No pressure. You came for the cats. You can be honest.""

We do not appreciate the insinuation we were dishonest when our intent was to be polite about declining the tour. Being pestered gave us the impression the tour guide had some incentive for conducting a tour. Seeing us take photos, she did not even offer to help us take a photo of my sis and I with the cats. It was a fellow local taking photos who actually volunteered to do so for us.

In Asia, it is common not to directly reject others. Not reading body language and not taking no for an answer graciously do not reflect well on her as someone ""volunteering"" in the hospitality sector."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Excellent place, great history, well presented.  Nice surrounding area too."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"If you are in the Kampong Glam area and ha e a few hours to spend/ or want to escape the heat, then this is the place to be. The Centre is very relaxed and has interesting information on the history of Malaysian in a Singapore. The staff were very friendly and did help to explain some of the exhibitions. Although the centre is worth a visit I think it could do more to welcome tourists and maybe to give visitors a free or cheap audio guide because some of the exhibits were a bit vague. There was a guided tour available at 1pm for English- but we missed it."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Free entry for us today. Eye opener for those of us who has shallow understanding of the Malay heritage. It is a short walking distance from the Majestic Sultan Mosque and Haji Lane.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,A very informative place on the Malay Culture. A short yet concise place to learn about the Malay Heritage. :))
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,A great place to learn about malays in Singapore. They did a good job in tracing back the history. A must visit place if you're interested in Malay Heritage History.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"This place provides a good understanding about the history of Singapore and how it came about to become Singapore. I particularly enjoyed the detailed description for each stage of development within the Malay region and the significant milestones. Taking time to read each description provided will greatly improve your understanding of certain areas in Singapore and appreciate the cultural significance of particular customs. I would recommend you book or attend a guided session as any questions you may have can be answered. However, I went alone and learned a lot from the information already provided."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Free entry for all Singaporeans and Singapore PR if you bring your IC/Student Pass. The building is small therefore don't expect to spend more than 1 and a half hours looking at the exhibition. Currently there is a special exhibition that is available at Hall 1 and 2.

Was told by the staff that the Heritage Centre would undergo a 2-3 years renovation in avout a year time. So I guess it's good to come how if you have yet to before they uplift the place."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"It's a beautiful house that once was the palace. The gardens are perfectly manicured but offer little shade. There is a small visitor center (free) and a museum inside, but for this you need to buy tickets and to enter, take off your shoes. A fountain in front is star-shaped."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,3,"Nothing exciting for me 😏
Nevertheless there's about the culture and history"
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,The Heritage Centre is quaint and peaceful! The Sultans Mosque is such a charm! A must visit while in Singapore.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,2,A bit boring to me.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Enjoyed myself thoroughly here. The royal exhibits are especially beautiful, located on the upper level. It also tells of the olden days ethnic Malays who were here first way before Raffles came. But when going to the first level you feel that too much was focused on the entertainment industry. Lacking in contribution to successful Malays especially on academics, science and such."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,Fantastic place to learn about the malaysian history with in Singapore and South East Asia over the last century and beyond.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,This was part of Changi Airport's free city tour itinerary. The place was so clean and just beautiful.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Visited two floors of exhibits, took us around 40 minutes to complete it. Interactive stations and children's play area closed. Museum shop in separate building."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,Good museum to learn Malay history. The museum stuffs were nice. I didn’t know much about their history but I got more interested in it after visiting here. Plenty of chairs are provided inside.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Great place to visit to take great pictures but also to learn about the Malay Heritage in Singapore.

Regular events on site and the fact that it is beside the Sultan Mosque makes this place vibrant and worth a visit."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Informative center set in nice well kept grounds and nice herb garden. Chilled out place where you're able to escape the busy streets in the area. For those needing the toilet, there's a good public toilet with child changing area."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"I am truly amazed by this place. Very astonishing! I'm Javanese from Indonesia and I love to know about Malay culture in particular. Here I find the right place to know many things, especially about the development of Malay people and culture in Singapore. For you who are interested in cultural things, I would highly recommend you to visit this place. If you're foreign visitor, it would cost you SGD 6 for Adults (20% discount for group of 20 pax and above), SGD 18 for family of 5 (not exceeding 3 adults), or SGD 4 for Seniors (60 years old and above) Students1 (Free for children under 6 years old) Persons With Disabilities (PWD). I visit this place in the first day of February 2020.

In general, the Malay Heritage Centre is housed in the former Istana Kampong Gelam, a palace which was gazetted as a National Monument of Singapore in 2015. The centre showcases the history, culture and contributions of the Malay community within the context of Singapore’s history and multi-cultural society.

Officially opened in June 2005, the Malay Heritage Centre provides wonderful cultural exposure and learning opportunities for visitors of all ages and interests. Situated amidst the Istana Kampong Gelam, Gedung Kuning and the surrounding Kampong Gelam precinct, the Centre acts as a vital heritage institution for the Malay community in Singapore.

The first Istana Kampong Gelam was a traditional timber structure built on stilts, and in honour of the Istana’s original layout, visitors will commence their tour of the permanent galleries from the upper level and end their visit on the ground level. In the traditional layout, the upper level is called the panggung, which serves as the main living and sleeping quarters of the house, while the kolong at the ground level is typically used as storage, work or service areas, and even as a children’s play area.

I wish I can get back here next time! :)"
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Wonderful place. Came here during the annual Malay cultural festival and the grounds were so energetic. The centre itself is superbly preserved and maintained
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"I learnt so much about the Malay culture and that its so good to know about the roots of singapore with all the exhibitions displayed. This place is so iconic and historical. Also, I recommend for visitors to remove your shoes before entering and wear socks if you do not want your feet to be left with nasty black stains. But overall, I love the aesthetics of this place and how regal the place looks."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Tranquility place in centre of Little India. Nice park with relaxing pagoda, small botanical garden with herbs, fontain in the centre, cozy souvenir shop, visitor's centre. If you want to know more about history, you should visit."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Interesting history, including Singapore’s first president."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Awesome place.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,3,"A small place. Once should be able to complete the visit in 30-45min. Highly suggest one to spend a little more time outside the centre to see more of Malay culture. Other than the Mosque, there are a lot of restaurants."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Its great to bring preschoolers here to learn about the Malay Artifact to relate to the Malay Cultural Learning.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"The location is a little bit secluded, but quite easy to reach by bus or MRT. It is near the Masjid Sultan, which is clearly visible from a distance. The museum itself has 2 floors with many interesting item, but I would like to recommend the free guided tours, which runs from 11 am for about 1 hour. The tour guide is very professional and thorough, with clear English and enthusiastic manner. There is a museum shop and some additional exhibition area, which is quite interesting. Recommended for people that has interest in Malay and Moslem tradition."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Nice place to visit. Must come
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"It's clean and well preserved. The overall design is retained however the palace grounds is improved with modern landscape. The contents of the museum is so insufficient to reflect the true Malay culture. The kampung spirit and the simple lifestyle of the Malays.
Not much history about the inhabitants of the palace. I know as my great grandmother was an inhabitant there. Direct descendent of Sultan Hussein."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Good glimpse into the past history of Singapore after Raffles landed. Worth a visit and also surrounding areas with rich Malay culture and nice food
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Right place to know Singapore history. It is decent and clean llace. Lots of halal food stores here as well, good thing for Moslem traveler"
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,3,"Can do, but not a must. Only for hard core museum fans also having a lot of time to read."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Great place to relax and learn about Malay culture in Singapore. Information centre, gift shop and guides available.

Lots of space to stroll and relax.

Clean public facilities available. Just steps away from the main Mosque."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Good for tourists to learn about the culture, however it is not so much of a place for beautiful murals and sceneries. The garden is clean and organized, however not enough for you to be in awe. If looking for murals, just walk around in the alley(s) nearby."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Wonderful place for get together. Famous Victoria street and Sultan Mosque just opposite of this heritage centre.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"Very interesting Malay heritage centre. It display a wide range of Singapore Malay history, cultures, tradition and the contribution of the settler since hundreds years until modern age. Very interesting even for local Singaporean to visit and understand own other cultures. Eye opening tour. Must visit for Singapore trip."

Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"It was an incredible place to learn more about the history of the Malays during the early days as you could explore around and observe artifacts and read descriptions. There even was a part where u could chill out and relax on a chair and watch the history of the Malays displayed on a projector across the wall. It was also a comfortable place to be in as it is generally clean and has air-conditioning. Furthermore, it even lets you have a first hand experience on the Malay Games kids used to play in the past(e.g. chapteh, five stones) and also how to wear a traditional sarong. I highly recommend this place if you are keen about learning about Singapore's past, or even as a tourist!"

Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,1,"Pretty unfriendly place. The minute me and my son got here, on a Tuesday evening at 5:10 - ostensibly 50 mins before closing- I was asked/told:
1. What I was doing there?
2. If I was singaporean
3. I have 15 mins

There was not a single visitor. I entered from the museum store but upon every was told that the store was closed.
The exhibits were really nice and engaging for little kids and i really learnt something new. There isn't a lot of info about Malay culture in Singapore and it was pretty eye opening. But the terse, unwelcoming attitude of the staff there really put me off."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Situated in Singapore's heritage district of Kampong Glam and right next to the Sultan Mosque, the Malay Heritage Centre provides excellent cultural insights into the Malay community in Singapore. The visit starts at the upper level, followed by the lower level and two external outhouses, housing permanent galleries. They showcase stories and artifacts from both Singapore's national collection as well as contributions from the local community. It is a reflection of Kampong Glam's historical significance as well as the contribution of the local Malay society. The structure was once of traditional timber built on stilts, which has been thoroughly renovated over time. It is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00am to 6:00pm, with free admission for all Singaporeans & Permanent Residents. A couple of hours can be easily spent here."

Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Loved it. Great service. Nice exhibits. I was wondering though about so much focus on entertainment contributions. What about in other fields?  Academia,  science,  tech,  medicine. I might be wrong but I thought this was a bit better covered in the other heritage centres."
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"Nice grounds, interesting museum & surrounding area"
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,Nice Museum about the Malay History in Singapore and not only about the modern development everyone knows. The Museum goes much further back then the British time and shows about the history of the whole region. But the actual British time to the modern is missing a bit in my opinion. Nonetheless a good museum to visit if you are interested about all of the history of Singapore.
Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,5,"A small Gallery on the origins of Singapore and Malay culture. With several artefacts from the 14th century to the 20th century.

Kampong Glam & Malay Culture in Singapore,4,"As part of the Architectural Heritage Season 2018 organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in Singapore, I attended a talk that discussed the stories and challenges of the preservation and restoration of the Istana (""palace"" in Malay) and took a stroll around the entire building (and surrounding area).

Do wear cool clothes and comfortable walking shoes as you would most probably be walking the area around the building too - and THAT for me is the highlight of the visit.

I liked how the Malay culture and way of living sprang out organically surrounding the Malay Heritage Centre. You can see how the residents (both Malay and non-Malays) co-existing in a sort of complementary ways. This is a quintessential Singaporean experience that must not be missed. You would be hard pressed to find this experience anywhere else !

"The Substation, Singapore Contemporary Art Centre",5,Was meandering around town following the Singapore Biennial trail and ended up serendipitously at the substation even though there was nothing listed on the programs guide. And it just happened that there was a talk about gender racism and it was a lively discussion packed with an audience. Something that took me by surprise. We just crashed in and soaked up the academic discussion. Got us thinking about it afterwards with our own healthy discussion. Loved the whole bohemian vibe of the artsy corner overall. Will definitely look out for further events lined up.

Welcoming and friendly staff, great design ideas which are very well-presented.

The cost of the ticket ($10) can even be put towards any item from the shop at the end of your visit, including food and drinks! What's not to like about that?!

I'll definitely be back to visit again when the 2021 Red Dot Design Award winners have been announced."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Interesting place n very tastefully done up. Like that it's not crowded as it's a very small museum. I won't be able to enjoy d ambience n exhibits if d place is crowded n noisy. Purchased d tickets with my SRV. Value-for-money to visit it during this period of time. *More for adults n older kids.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,The gift shop had been filled with many interesting products. Highly recommended. It's 10 per entry but with a  free 10 dollars voucher for purchase of food at their cafe or gift shop. The popcorn was nice.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Nice place to see creative & awarded designs around the world. The museum is a little bit small so expect to read the printed descriptions more than seeing the actual products. The ticket can be exchanged into a cash voucher that you can use at the cafe/shop :)
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,We visit using the Singapore Discovery Voucher for $10 per person and got 2 $11 voucher for food or sovenir as we visit on Thursday. It's worth the visit as we only pay $1.50 for the food after using those vouchers. It's small but worth your time.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,The food and drinks are nice and the items in the gift shop are interesting! 2F physical display are interesting but a little lacking. Most are information display which is a little boring.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"There was a wide variety of innovations made for all aspects of life from all around the world that are introduced. However, I feel that there should be more physical items or at least models of those items on display instead of boards explaining them. Despite so, I do recommend it to people who are interested in tech and design."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Quaint little museum, showing award winning product designs. Has a small cafe and souvenir shop that's also with a look."

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice and quiet museum and cafe. Interesting exhibits. Salted egg dumplings is very nice.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Granted that the museum needs to conserve electricity, more fans would be helpful. I can't wait to get out cos it's so warm inside. Good that the ticket comes with a 10 dollar voucher to spend at the café or the shop."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It was amazing and meticulously ornate.. All the designs were very ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.. Me and my son just loved it.. Even my husband was awed by the whole experience..
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Not ad interesting. More for adults, not kids.
Used SDV and its a good deal. We used the given vouchers for snacks!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Re-explore & re-discover Singapore. This is a 'must' visit place. Some design pieces made you look at things in a different perspective. Enjoyed the time there & love the lighting design in the museum. Thanks to Carrie & Raudha for the great hospitality!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Great coffee and cake, 3 beers for 24$. And The shop is filled with design and creative items."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"For people who appreciates beautiful and modern designs.  The place has a small cafe with very limited seats but three are tables and seats outside for al fresco dining. (Sorry, I forgot to snap the menu) There are some beautifully designed works up for purchase in the store.  Overall, the experience was nice, to me.
(Note: there is a $10 entrance fee)"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Come here to see Asian design
Great place to understand what design is? The only red dot design museum of southeast Asia and South Asia be it product design 🎨, graphic design.
Amazing location near the sea, the cafe, and the merchandise store complete the visit ."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Don't overlook this small museum. You could easily spend over two hours here if you were to view the exhibition thoroughly. Admission price includes gift shop and cafe coupons and a view book which will detail you through every piece. This museum goes beyond the physical aspect of design and invokes insight into the underlying humanitarianism under technology and creation
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"It was a very creative museum. The location was very nice with the view straight to the bay. Inside, it was small museum showing new technology of the world, new creations of the world such as the sport suits, phones, smart stuff for the house, headphones, etc... It was very nice to walk around and to be able to touch things in the museum"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Love it, alot of innovative ideas to check it out. Lovely cake and coffee too."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Not that bad, but all in all relatively small and relatively unspectacular. I was hoping for inspiring product designs but I must say the whole place seemed relatively dull to me. On another note, it is rather small, thus not really justifying the ticket price in my eyes"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Not big but full of it's features!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A very interesting museum! Definitely a must-go spot if you’re enjoying visiting museums! Entry fee is cheap and you get coupon if you purchase the entry ticket! Small but can offer you with insights and ideas!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This is one of the best museums I've been to. There are lots of interesting stuff, especially the advanced technologies displayed, some are even interactive! I definitely recommend this 👍"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"There were definitely a lot of very interesting exhibits on the second floor, but the artefacts were so badly organized and cluttered that it felt overwhelming. Furthermore, the briefs, while fascinating, failed to consistently elucidate how the displayed design was an improvement over existing designs that claim to serve the same function."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,A good museum for product design. Pretty small though with very little to see (maybe 1hrs worth). Entry free was reasonable and it was a great ambience
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"The place is a unique collection of artefacts band modern gadgets.
Awesome and Affordable place for everyone. It's a must for everyone who want to make their Singapore moment a special and unforgettable one. It's good for Family as well. You will cherish coming here. The place has superb amenities and services to offer. I would highly recommend anyone coming here to see and experience it for yourself. The place is well connected to the Metro Station and Bus Terminal. Also it has Restrooms for your convenience. You can pay via Cash/ Debit card/ App (Grab). It's very clean and hygienic."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Awesome, great fun place to take the kids or date night. Can’t wait to go back again and again!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"The museum is small, the shop is interesting yet on the small side. The cafe very average for the price.
Overall a nice place to kill time if you have nothing to do around the area..."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"it was cool and a breath of fresh air, but it is kinda small tbh and i expected it to be bigger idk why. 3.5 stars"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"With SGD$11.80 for entrance fee that comes with a complimentary catalogue and discount vouchers for the cafe bar, the quite small and packed Red Dot Design Museum makes up for all the insights and knowledge you're about to learn inside the museum. A must see apart from the more famous, touristy museums in Singapore! We hope to visit again soon."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"10 sgd ticket per pax, inclusive of 10 sgd voucher for gift shop and cafe. Quite an interesting exhibition. Even though the place is about good product design, the exhibition is poorly designed. For example, the panels are mostly too low. Food is surprisingly interesting. Bought the chilli crab and nasi lemak popcorn and earl grey chiffon. Staff helpful, let us sample popcorn. Near bayfront mrt but no shelter"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Small place with innovative and unique display. Good to visit if you have a lot of time
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Nice museum! Not too big, but lots of interesting things to see. Cute play/puzzle area for kids upstairs, worth a short visit if you’re in the area. If you’re getting the package for gardens by the bay on klook, come early so you have enough time to really look around before you go to gardens by the bay which is a bit of a walk from here, 15 to 20 minutes."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Inspiring items. Great gift shop with tons of cool stuff for both kids and adults. Cafe very nice. The museum itself seems a bit small for the price. Easy to see everything in ten minutes. Entrance fee comes with a nice book filled with pictures and stories of all items. It would be nice to see more art and furniture designs. Too heavy on tech design.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A lot of interesting designs here, very inspiring! Gave me a lot to think about, and I'm not even a designer. Entrance is only S$6.4, and for that you get a voucher for S$2 for the cafe and S$4 for the shop. I can recommend this place. Had an ice coffee in their Cafe, which was not that exciting."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A museum and a shop dedicated to all things that have won a Red Dot award. There are some interactive elements in the museum which make it fun, however it is very small and can be done in 30-45min. Entry is very reasonable price that includes a voucher to use for snacks from the shop downstairs. Shop is free to enter and displays some items for purchase from the museum and others that simply have been well designed."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Looks good from outside at night. Did not go inside. Excellent location near MBS and Singapore river.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I love good design and I loved this museum.

You have to pay $6.40 as a non national (minimum charge) but if you slip for a few dollars more you get a little gift (mine was a choice of a nice metal pin) and know you are supporting the place a bit more.

Everyone who pays gets $6 in vouchers back (4 for the store and 2 for the cafe)

The displays aren't huge and are mostly themed poster boards (not made of paper!) With the occasional real object. But it was still excellent

I found myself wishing for an indicator on reach item description letting me know if it was actually available to buy. I spent a good bit of time googling around as I went.

The cafe was excellent, the neat cubes of food were a visual and taste delight.

Like any design / museum shop, the stuff in it is lovely but ain't cheap."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Haven't been round the museum. Great little spot for a coffee or beer on the corner of the bay. Friendly service and reasonable prices
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Looks at some designs of local and overseas technology products which are still not available commercially. Small place but worth it since there is Singapore rediscover ongoings 10$ ticket with 11$ voucher
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Really interesting place with exhibits that showcase various products and the design philosophies behind them. Highly recommended if you're into product design or want to know what the future of our product ecosystem might look like!

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice small museum with interesting displays. Cool AC and clean restrooms.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Nice concepts. Though this is not the original red dot award exhibition. It is the “new concepts” version. Also great that one could leverage the ticket fee to purchase in their coffee bar/souvenir shop.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice place..nice weather...nice company..
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Got free ticket to checkout this place. Was very excited before going in but was not as impressed as I imagine after finished the tour.
Most of the items can be seen in our daily life. The fourth star given out for reminding us that we are taking these designs granted and we forgot to appreciate the thoughts that putting in the products."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"High recommend this museum. Very interesting art even for non art lover. Cool tech stuff too. Especially the 21 colours life strip, interesting view on different lives based on different occupationa."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting display of current design concepts which include AI, human fitness and environmental themes.  Professional, friendly staff. Discounts offered with entrance;$4 in gift shop + 10% in cafe. Tasty cakes and tea!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,This museum is not something as I expected. It’s small and not many gadgets and gizmos. The admission fee includes a catalog. It’s good one but too heavy for tourists. I returned it back. It’s fun to see latest technology though.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The Museum is filled with award winning designs, it is an great learning experience for any designer, totally inspiring and mind blowing peaces of Art & Design."

It's a bit to small, but definitely worth to visit."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very much enjoyed my visit to the museum earlier this month. The shop also offers some good designs  and fun products and has a bar which offers some innovative food cubes and beers on tap. The outdoor area is quite inviting for a nice break under shade.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Loved this place and worth a visit whilst in Singapore (especially if you need to pick up tickets for Gardens by the Bay). Some really cool stuff and interactive tech. Gift shop is great with some nice ideas for presents. Coffee taste good.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Exquisite place to explore nice designs 👍🏼
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"ticket is a bit expensive, but if you like design issues very much, you should visit"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Really nice find in the middle of loud and overcrowded with tourist area. Reasonable ticket price includes the current catalogue of Red Dot awarded designs. The exhibition might not look as very big, but when you dig into the descriptions and try to analyze the presented exhibits (not only their look, but taking design from the User Experience perspective), you are lost for an hour or so! Highly recommended."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Amazing place to chill out. With $6 craft beer and situated next to the Marina Bay reservoir. Imagine the sights and sound and the Breeze.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"It's was OK, but it missed a theme / story. Just a collection of nicely designed objects."

For me, as im not into all of this technology very much, its just so so for me.."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Small museum, only takes 30 mins to see everything. Some interesting products and concepts to see. Could do with more items and better descriptions for each item. VR headset wasn’t working which was disappointing. Book they give you is nicely illustrated. If into industrial design is worth a quick visit."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Design is the most underrated part in life. This is why I appreciate visiting the museum. I can’t wait to rediscover my perception of good design in this museum again!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Awesome exhibition that shows how everydays’ objects are think and made to sublimate user experience. People are very nice and helpful ! I will come back in my next SG trip.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"This is a small museum where you can see some interesting and futuristic creations. It is not so expensive, at least the entry.
I had the  best tea I had ever tasted there, the staff is very friendly.
I wanted to buy something from the shop there, but everything was quite expensive, but that was not shocking, because most of the objects were original and you cant buy them anywhere else.
In the end, if you have plenty of time in Singapore, if you dont mind to spend some dollars for tickets and if you are interested in design and modernity, it is definitely worth your time."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Many magnificent ideas showing here with a prototype and there are a lot of finish products to buy. Love them!

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"It's the best place to see minimalist, modern technology. They also offer food and other items to buy. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. If you're going to visit Singapore, I highly recommend to visit this place."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"the tickets cost around 6.5 SGD. (included 2 SGD food voucher + 4 souvenir voucher).  They had a lot of new and creatives ideas, however most of it , only presented on papers or film. ( the point of museum usually to be able to present the exhibit physically). some times i felt that it is better to just simply search on google "" novel/new creative product design ideas instead of coming here. lastly, you can use vouchers by stacking it with another voucher hence you only pay less."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"A small but beautiful design museum. With a number of interesting pieces, primarily in technology space. Showcasing local concepts and winner from various designs"

Many cool and unique designs inside the museum."

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,Amazing display of modern technology. Showcasing the tech from early 20th century up to now. Very cool place situated right beside the marina. The cafe is also good. You can buy some cold drinks perfect if its too hot outside. A lot of merchandise items are for sale also. You’d be very interested with the wide array of items being displayed.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I didn't know what the exhibition was about initially but really enjoyed it in the end. Check out the shop, its unlike any typical museum souvenir shop."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Great place with an awesome display of items in the museum
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,It had some cool designs but I expected little more designs and bigger place. But overall it was good.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"A bit pricey for the museum. Some cool stuff on display, but the curation left a lot to be desired. Pieces within a section felt disjointed, and the different parts of the museum weren't woven together to tell a great story.

The snacks were actually pretty tasty, at an okay price."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,I don't think it's really worth to pay for museum visit. As there is nothing much inside.

Absolutely disappointing, just a bunch of random prototypes put together, but not much different from a electronics store.  I don't recommend this museum."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Good museum, a little pricey to enter but some really cool stuff inside. Shop was also really cool."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"If you're interested in design and technology then this place is worth the visit. 2 floors to view, probably spend around an hour."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"It’s on my bucket list for a long time! $11 admission fee and you’ll have a free book to bring home! If you are traveling in Singapore, you know what to do.🤭😜"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Showcasing things with different and unconventional design.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"The items are not sufficient enough, nor representative enough to demonstrate as museum."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I think this is the only museum in Singapore which opens till 2am midnight. Had a great time there! The atmosphere, interior and the product design are just perfect. I recommend you to buy the red dot design review book when you get there. Updated ones could be very expensive. But get the old one with very affordable price. If you are interested in design thinking, this is definitely a must place for you to go."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"What an amazing museum! Excellent source of inspiration for anyone who likes great quality products, which are a treat for the eye in trigger your creativity!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Its tiny but it's a good place to chill when you need to cool down around the bay.

But I love the cafe view though.. they should hv added more varieties of snacks.."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Unexpected find during a walk along the bay. Interesting art with hints of architecture. Bought a few knick knacks myself!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Went here to collect my ticket to gardens by the bay. U have to walk awhile from bayfront mrt exit. It was sooo humid that time. The place is rather small and theres a food bar here. I dont know much about design but it gets nice reviews from aspiring designers. U can also buy merchs there, but its kinda expensive for me haha Its 950m away from gardens by the bay but i suggest u to walk. The view is amazing."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Charming little place to enjoy an afternoon snack.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A perfect moment of relax during your daytime in Singapore, take your time to visit the marvelous RED DOT DESIGN MUSEUM and refresh with a drink at the bar, just the spectacular view of the skyline in front of you"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Pretty small yet beautiful museum
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Award modern designed museum. We were here to collect our klook garden by the bay tickets
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Short visit to see some of the most spectacular designs of this decade. That building itself stands out at the park because of its beautiful architecture. If only it could contain more and more real work from the design, instead of just pictures, it would attract more tourists."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Nice place with creative and fun stuff, worth spending time"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Definitely a treat to discover innovative solutions and ideas through the medium of design from around the world.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"More related to architecture design, Ai robots and IT..."

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,They sell artistic stuff from designers
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Some interesting exhibit, suitable for a short date."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This is a real find; fun, informative and inspiring. Excellent value with catalogue included in the entry along with discount vouchers. Very helpful staff. We spent about two hours completely engrossed. If you want to glimpse the possibilities of future tech trends I would highly recommend a visit."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The Red Dot Design Museum showcases many very innovative designs, whether it's the aesthetic looks, materials, multi functionality. The Museum also provides a Human Nature exhibition guide that provides an introduction for each exhibit. The display is easy to follow and coming on a weekday morning is quite peaceful. It's surely worth a visit to be exposed to many inspiring innovations that are and will be shaping our future undoubtedly!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Some really interesting and inspiring design pieces, mainly focusing on new technologies and innovations. A great catalogue is included with the ticket, going into loads of detail about the items on display as well as others not included in the exhibition. The gift shop has loads of cool little products and the cafe is great."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Unique and practical designs are displayed here. Amusing
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A very creative place
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice place to visit while you’re in the area.  It provided a cool place to relax and see the exhibits of great design.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Master pieces are found here.. Wonderful place. Kind staff. 👍
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very informative and interactive small exhibition. Mixture of technology I was aware about already however newer versions and innovations that made it very interesting. Takes about an hour to go round the museum. Would definitely recommend if in Singapore !
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,"Not inspirational at all! They have basically printed out the red dot book on large posters and stuck them on the walls, lit tables, etc. With some videos playing. Where were the designers in all this 🤔"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Excellent Display of Futuristic Design. A definite kick start for a design lover's brain
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very interesting museum filled with all sorts of cool gadgets to look at and learn about
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,I wish the items are a bit cheaper and in the museum I wish there are more. The creations were great. What I like the most is the 500 pens. I also like the staff they are very accommodating. I'm giving 4 of 5 since this needs to be improved. Good job Red Dot Design Museum.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"An intriguing museum highlighting all that is beautiful in the modern world as well as possible future innovations.  The entrance fee includes a comprehensive guidebook which describes everything on display.  Not best suited to those with very small children there is, nevertheless, a small interactive display upstairs which is suitable for children of primary school age.  The cafe and shop are a bit pricey so best avoided otherwise the Red Dot Design Museum is a great way to pass an hour or so."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Thank u for the good service..jolene here.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",1,"It just lots of description of their rewarded items, nothing really you can touch or feel. Being a design museum I would expect the museum is also a show case but it's just a badly designed building and even the toilet was so badly designed that you need to open the toilet door by pulling the bag hanger!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Really cool museum, has a very futuristic design. If you're interested in post modern design / tech design, it's definitely worth checking out. The sedition on Google's design was a personal highlight.

It's a smaller museum, but very well curated. Has a nice café downstairs too. The staff were excellent and very friendly to boot."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I’m on my first visit to Singapore and instead of choosing to go to the Singapore Zoo, we decided to visit the Red Dot Design Museum in Marina Boulevard. I really liked the display of products that showcase human nature in good design of high tech products. I’m an architect so I doubly appreciated the display of products that were awarded the red dot design award. The museum shop is another really fun place to go to. Great products! Beautifully designed space"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting, full of gadgets of friendly staff"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Must visit if you have any design savvy people in your group. Small but well curated. The physical setting is amazing with views of the harbor and marina bay sands. We had breakfast at the cafe and they made high quality coffee and had a small but good section of rice dumplings.

The entrance fee is low and there is are a wide variety of products represented. My only criticism is that there were too many products displayed that were just a picture of the product and not the product itself. Also I think it would be interesting if more of the items they had were turned on / were able to interact with them.

The gift shop is great and you will most likely buy something before leaving.

Overall excellent and a nice change from the usual touristy stuff in Singapore. Well worth the entrance fee."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Nice little museum showcasing some great design ideas from a range of products types covering AI to clothing, data representation to robotics.
The guide book is included in the ticket price and is a nice little take-away.
Nice way to spend an hour or two, especially if you've an interest in design and/or tech."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This is an excellent small museum close to Marina Bay. Won’t take your whole day, and if you’re interested in design/tech, you’re gonna have a great time. Companion book for the exhibition is included in the reasonable ticket price and a nice plus. Very friendly and helpful staff."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Contents are not enough!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The museum is very informative, worth a visit 👍"

Interesting guide book included with admission price.
Free WiFi.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Definitely worth a visit"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I visited Red Dot Design museum for the Human Nature exhibition and I liked the pace of the exhibition. The information and language of it was interesting to both the general public and professionals of that field, being a researcher myself. The staff were also approachable and knowledgeable."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Great museum, designs are great and staff is very friendly and informative. They also give you a nice thick design book alongside your ticket purchase which is also very cheap compared to other museums! The museum shop let’s you try out all the products and feels like part of the exhibition. Very nice. Also has bathrooms. Come visit!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Really worth it! A lot of interesting modern stuff to see. For 12$ you get entry the guide book to keep and I also got some discount from the shop! The ticket price very reasonable and you get a book about the exhibition with the ticket! The museum shop sells very nice creative items with very friendly staffs. The museum is small but I actually like the size. About 150 items to see. Most have information but you can use the book to help you!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Fascinating, entertaining museum. Whether you are interested in design or not the way it communicates modern technologies and concepts will intrigue anyone. The museum showcases far more than was expected showing concepts and prototypes of technologies in lifestyle, health, architecture, engineering, biology and more. Although small the museum can take 1 - 4 hours to fully experience depending on how you follow it. Would defiantly recommend!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This museum was really cool and shades of light on some of the incredible different design-led products that can be created. This facility really seems like an hommage to design thinking and the creativity, quality, and uniqueness to the is really cool. it's a nice way to beat the heat and see something truly unique and different while you are wandering around Marina Bay."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Small, but well organised and super interesting. The majority of the exhibit is just photos and information rather than the physical items, but space is as a premium so this is understandable."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Very friendly staff. Quite a few interesting items.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting design museum with a range of modern products, photos, videos, and inventions that inspire. Good descriptions on the display and in an impressive take-home catalog. Though it's a relatively small size, I spent two hours because it was just really interesting. Also a cool shop and cafe with nice view over the bay."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"As a design museum, it serves its purpose of educating the public of popular designs. The life stripe display was quite interesting. It's a  small museum with a cafe. You get a $4 discount voucher for any purchase and 30% off food. The online ticket price at $8 is a better buy than the on-site purchase of $11. You get a thick souvenir book to bring home ss well."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Incredible!
Carefully designed, full of mind opening ideas and very “visitors  friendly” (every item has a simple description attached, some have pictures or a video explaining \ introducing the device)
As part of the museum there’s a shop, in which you can find beautiful, interesting technologically advanced products.
The museum is suitable for both adults and children.
Highly recommended!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,The area is quite small.. but i love the cafe at the lower level plus the staff is helpful.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The red dot design museum in Singapore is the only design museum in the world with a state of the art design exhibition orchestrated by founder Ken Koo and his team in a continous update loop. Whenever you come you´ll experience what Design is now and in what direction design will evolve in the near future. By emphasizing the conceptual arena of design the red dot design museum in Singapore remains a one of a kind museum concept in the range of worldwide design shows .

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Beautiful, well-thought out displays. The Human - Nature Exhibition prompts you to question what is humanity and how technology is transforming our lives. A very thought provoking experience.  I definitely recommend visiting!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Small place but interesting.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,futuristic museum..you can see many kind of robot and drone...
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,Not very exciting as most of the products are printed on posters and you can not experience them.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"If you are keen to look for some quirky and fun stuff, do head over to Red Dot to have a look. I do find the products for sale interesting"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Very small. Only for those who like product design
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It's amazing here.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"A great place if you are into design & technology. A small place yet informative. A bunch of innovative and creative products being displayed here.

There's even a cafe and shop to buy creative cool stuffs"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Nice little museum covering product design. It has only two  levels, so maybe you will have seen everything in about an hour. Very lovely and helpful staff, i really enjoyed my stay! The little cafè is nice, too. :)"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Interesting Museum with interesting Human-Nature exhibition. Well placed exhibits with interestingly placed and written didactics. Eye opener on knowledge and information shared. The staff are very friendly, well mannered and indeed knowledgeable on the information of the Museum and the exhibition. Well done! And Thank you!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Interesting experience but I find the place a bit too small. Overall, it was an enjoyable visit. The salted caramel cake was nice but it would be better to be shared with friends. It is a bit too rich for my liking."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Interesting place with a nice playground for kids
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,This place is nice... Love the ambience and deco so much...we came to take our tix to gardens by the bay along with that they gv us  vouchers for cheaper waffle and goodie from the museum... Nice and friendly staff...
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Red Dot Design Museum Cafe operated by Food Anatomy serves appetizers, tapas, bar bites, cake and dessert. Tapas are presented in little cubes, and comes in local flavours such as Nasi Lemak, Beef Rendang, Laksa Pasta and Hainanese Chicken Rice. The Creme Brulee was definitely a favourite for desserts; and for variance there's always Matcha Brulee. Cosy cafe within the museum right beside the Marina Bay. Have a nice walk along the wateefront before or after a bite!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Good but its too small. Hope it will become bigger.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"An awesome place educating its visitors on innovative design ideas ranging from art to clothing and household items. The museum is fairly small, but so is the admission price. Well worth the visit if you are in the area."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Such an inspirational look at the future of design. I was constantly impressed at every turn. I only wish there was more to see but don't miss this place when visiting Singapore. Entertaining for adults and children.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A well curated, very informative exhibition. The space has a good layout and and projects nicely presented.

If you are designer or interested in design this is a must go. The museum store on the ground floor is great with interesting products and the cafe serves good coffee with a fantastic view."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,I love this museum! So much cool stuff. Really liked that they give you a Catalog to refer to while you're looking at all the objects. Dog robot was so cute and I really liked the 3 D maps.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Yesterday spent a very enlightening time in the museum. Saw a number of beautiful functional objects - my favourite was a fire extinguisher from Norway/ our enjoyment was made even greater by the very helpful counter staff. Would recommend to any visitor to Singapore.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"A good one to see new designs but much of them are on posters. Compares to the old museum, this one is more technological but less interactive."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Very pricey...some innovative products you can find...
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Excellent small museum of modern design. Showcases a real range of beautiful designs, interesting displays that showcase applications of technology too. I particularly liked a really beautiful display of data about daily habits of people as coloured barcodes, robots for caring for infants/babies and therapy. You also get a really beautiful catalogue as part of the entry fee, so I'd recommend visiting if you are short on time as you can experience the museum and then read at your let in detail later. The gift shop also has some nice purchases!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,It’s less of a museum and more of a store. Has some super cool design products in sales for all budgets.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A small but interesting museum full of intriguing objects. The questions posed at the beginning of each exhibit were a good way to get the visitor to carefully consider the items displayed and relate it to their own lives. My favourite was the Life Stripe artwork, where data on people's daily actions were turned into stripy patterns. It was fun to compare the life stripe of a cat to that of an office worker!
Spend around an hour at this museum, then whilst you chill out in their small cafe, you can admire the amazing view of the skyscrapers that surround you! You can easily combine a trip to the Red Dot Design Museum with the ArtScience Museum, which is not far away."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Nice ambience, the museum located right beside the merlion (lake). The museum tune a music which fit the ambience. The collection of the museum is pretty good althought the place is not really big. They also sell the souvenir for the art lovers. When we visit the museum, it was pouring that afternoon. So we ordered some menu from its cafe. The taste of their coffee and waffle is average. I think they should improve their f&b taste to attrack more tourist. The ambience of the outdoor cafe must be amazing to enjoy on dawning time."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Had a great time exploring the museum, a little small but filled with interesting ideas and objects. Loved that they gave a book before entering that you can keep.

Would’ve loved it was bigger and had more to see."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Really cute activity for a rainy day. Interesting things to see and lots of cool design items. We enjoyed. Also cake looks great but we had just eaten!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The human nature exhibition is very interesting. The book included with the ticket contains lots of info and it really makes you think where are we going as human species.
The exhibition is clearly presented, neat and with not too much info to keep going. We loved the robots part and the Life Stream codes.
Recommended if you are interested in robotics, our future and design in general."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Not much to see just some devices on display. Only limited devices can be interacted with or powered on. It would be great offer visitors could interact with most of the devices. Current exhibition cannot justify for a 12SGD entry fee.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Small but inspiring museum, decorations and exhibition are well-chosen, entrance ticket comes with the annual catalogue. Content-wise, it covers many different topics ranging from technological innovations in art to everyday machines to medicine and philosophical nudges.. I felt like it was a little ‘plain’ and not too interactive though after all and you maybe wouldn’t choose to spend hours here but if that’s what you’re after, I’d definitely recommend going!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"First time in Red Dot Design Museum, was a quaint but comprehensive exhibition space. The most recent exhibition “Human Nature” defines and examines the future outlook of the various areas of design that is influencing the advancement of our human ‘nature’ and civilisation, from enhanced sensory devices, to artificial intelligence and robotics. So I hope to see more informative and interesting design exhibits at the Red Dot Design Museum Singapore in the near future."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This was a unique museum filled with innovative designs! There are many interesting items, and it's a lovely space. It's worth checking out!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Finest and modern design exhibitions displaying. If you know Red Dot Design Awards, you'll know what to expect . Not expect a huge museum though"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Great little gem in Singapore that explores design, technology and innovation. We got free tickets with our tickets to the Gardens at the Bay and enjoyed looking around. Great gift shop with some lovely postcards too."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Must see museum if you enjoy innovated and aesthetically pleasing designs. Lovely cafe and really cool gift shop. The museum uses a book as an guide, which is a very informative tool. My one complaint is the overall flow of museum and how it matches the book was a bit confusing, but maybe that’s due to lack of space. But overall very unique and interesting. Would recommend if you are interested in design."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Design's addicts? You should try to visit the museum. The collection isn't as much as DDP at Seoul...*for comparison...since the museum is quite small... but it's still interesting to explore.

The cafe serves delicious cakes... but it's a bit pricey. At the time I visited the museum... there's a SGD 2 discount for eating at the cafe for each admission ticket.

When I visited the museum... seems like the air con didn't work really well... it's so hot inside the museum... especially on the second floor."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Can I put 6 stars?
So innovative and inspirational place. Must visit for everyone who think and imagine the future. Take your friend or children it will interesting for everyone!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting museum dedicated to ingenious innovations, mostly within Asia. The building is small, I thought I would spend only a few minutes here, but I did enjoy all the exhibitions and read everything, I ended up spending almost an hour here, including enjoying the cake. This museum sells the best salted caramel red velvet cake I’ve ever tasted :)"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting museum showcasing the design of all sorts of items. From technological devices to everyday kitchenware. For Singaporeans, it's pay as you wish! Your proceeds will help the museum."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This gallery has an excellent display.  I liked the scale of it as it is quite small, whilst ensuring there is plenty to see and a good variety of items.

Currently showcasing humans and technology, it is interesting to see how we are embracing technology within our daily lives.

In a great location near Marina Bay Shoppes and MRT access."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,I bought ticket in Klook and it’s worth it. The museum is very informative and you can learn a lot of things. It’s interesting especially the book that has lights when you open. They also have very nice toilet. Very clean and unique experience.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The museum has many innovative and interesting exhibits. Same goes for the retail side as they have many unique souvenirs that are not only nice but useful in a way. The staff are friendly and attentive.  The museum also has a cafe and it comes with outdoor seating as well, its facing the marina promenade hence the view is awesome."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice design museum
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Came here for Human-Nature Exhibition, it was very interesting, love the robots and through the lens section. The ticket price very reasonable and you get a book about the exhibition with the ticket! The museum shop sells very nice creative items with very friendly staffs. The museum is small but I actually like the size."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Smaller than I expected, but actually the size was probably just right for absorbing info of an exhibition. It was also very reasonably priced - ticket price also includes a catalogue. As with most ""design"" shops, the gift shop has some great things in it. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're a design nut. It was easy to find too."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"If you want to get inspired of the new technology and pieces of unique artwork that would be loved by both adults and kids, don’t forget to visit the Red Dot Design Museum.

People who works here are also very approachable to our queries which is a total big plus to our visit. Kudos to the team. Hope to see more of their art works soon.."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very interesting museum with good interpretation of exhibits.  Small in scope, but many cool items.  Good place to visit for a bit if you like design.  Gift shop has many tempting items but is quite expensive so prepare accordingly."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,It's a cool place to chill plus a great view of Marina Bay
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Nice place to take a walk and look around. But the prices of things inside is murderous. Too expensive for me.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Interesting shop but a bit small.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A must visit, even if you're not a technophile. Quite intriguing. Showcases tons of pioneering products with easy to understand narratives of how these innovations are unknowingly simplifying our lives."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I came here for a design conference and have been wanting to visit this place. It's just so amazing. Every part of this studio has the element of design. Love the book I received for the tour. Staff is friendly, cordial and nice. Love the ambiance."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"I didn't go inside the museum but checked the shop attached to it.

It's so fascinating to see the shop and different designs (and then the price)

If you buy a $11 ticket for museum, they give you a huge coffee table book with details of products who received this award in the past. 10/10 would recommend the coffee table book."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,We booked a Klook deal that required collecting our tickets from the Red Dot Museum. As part of the deal we could enter the museum. We spent a pleasant half hour looking through the exhibits. The shop has lots of lovely and unusual things to browse too. The cakes in the café looked delicious but unfortunately we didn't have the appetite to try them so soon after breakfast!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Not worth buying a ticket you can just visit the shop( which doesn’t require a 10 dollar ticket) and it’s is the same thing with the upstairs museum
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The Red Dot museum was an unexpected highlight of our Singapore visit. We had breakfast and coffee at the shaded cafe outside with a great view of the Marina Bay Sands. They serve delicious traditional Singaporean rice dumplings and a really light Earl Grey cake, along with coffee in design-ey vacuum mugs.  Before we even went in it was a really nice, off the beaten path way to get a quintessential Singapore experience!

The museum itself is extremely well curated and includes their recent design award winners as well as a permanent design collection - categories span transportation, housewares, commercial space etc. Well worth the entrance fee!

And lastly the staff were great; they  served a great breakfast and helped us try on everything in the gift shop (I got a pair of shoes). Overall a great stop even on a very short trip!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The experience was worth the price! Also it is instagrammable and the receptionist was SUPER nice, they welcomed you warm and helpful as well. Definitely will come back and ask my friends to come with as well 💕"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,The Design Museum has moved to this new site. It’s smaller but flooded with light so you can enjoy the exhibits. Such an interesting museum. It’s a great location. Lots to see and do nearby. With your ticket comes a discount for the tiny cafe and in the shop. I bought a scented candle as a present and the lovely lady staff member gift wrapped it for me which I really appreciated. Recommended.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"It was a very cool museum showing a lot of design in technology and household products. With admission ($8 online), you get to take home a guide book on the items in the museum, as well as a few coupons to use in the gift shop and cafe!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"The shop is far more interesting than the museum itself. The book that they give you with the ticket is a good coffee table read too. The museum itself is small, and underwhelming if you go in expecting anything. It is simply a display of products that have won a red dot design award, and yes they're all pretty."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Little interesting place. Didn't enter the museum but the shop itself had many little quirky items for sale. Cute items and fascinating products.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Really unique experience and unlike what you expect out of a museum visit. Very nicely curated products with very well thought out processes of the design of the museum.
Very detail oriented."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Interesting museum and comfortable cafe with delicious cakes! Free catalogue and vouchers for the shop when you purchase a ticket. Museum shop has very interesting things!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I visited the museum in Feb 2019 and found so many interesting inspiring design ideas for DIY projects. Innovation where it just can be in this year with very useful functional design ideas, the museum shop is well priced and staff is very friendly. I would recommend the museum to anyone who likes to be inspired and to those who love functional design. The catalogue is worth to get, because you can take the complete museum with you in a print format. Thank you again for this rich experience. All the best."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Practical designs exhibit.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Recommended by my friend, this is a must visit place in Singapore, even if you’re not a design fanatic. It’s beautiful and magical. This place oozes of creativity and imagination. The various products and the thought process behind them, it’s nothing short of marvellous. You made my day, red dot design museum. Thank you!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Great Museum. Total different to standard museum. Staff is very friendly and competent. Great is the opportunity to buy things from the exhibition.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"It was a great experience, a real eye-opener. We hear so much about the new technologies, but to see them and contemplate their meaning for what it means to be human and what it will come to mean in a few years time. I really loved the museum guide, it was a big insight into the tour."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,One of the nicer and well curated museums I have visited and is a must see if you visit Singapore. In a very convenient location in the Marina Bay area and is sure to spark an interest in design for yourself. The museum shop is pretty cool too.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Only the store is open. exhibit under construction. looking forward to it's reopen
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"We had free admission. Small Museum. Interesting for what it is, and mostly products (several of which you can easily purchase or probably have purchased) behind glass."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very cool little museum. Comes with a free book detailing every exhibit. Nifty tech and products
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,While I’m not super tech savvy this museum was very interesting and found things I’d never seen before. Definitely suggest if you’re going to be in a Singapore!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Incredibly designed exhibition! The objects, the technology and art displayed are really interesting. Would love to see more"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Interesting Space
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Really worth it! A lot of interesting modern stuff to see. For 12$ you get entry the guide book to keep and I also got some discount from the shop! About 150 items to see. Most have information but you can use the book to help you!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Interesting designs and concepts. Beautiful photobook.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,It’s a really interesting museum with diverse inventions. The small movies in between and the explanations are well explained and give a good impression how especially the robots are being used. The gift shop with different designs and products is also really nice selected. A good experience to get a first impression on different designs and inventions.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Buy your ticket online for a discount. This is a great design museum with good store and cafe! Takes about an hour to go through the exhibit.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"human nature exhibition was interesting and thought-provoking.  Recommended by a friend so came with relatively high expectations but even so it still surpassed.  Table tennis vs robot film was personal highlight

You leave with more questions than you enter"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Nice little museum with some of the red dot award products. I was expecting to see a little bit more products, both in the shop and in the exhibition; however, it was cool and as a Designer myself, I always enjoy coming to these type of museums.
Nice smiley and friendly stuff.
;) Martha"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Compact and very well laid out exhibition. Some great themes running through it and some stunning design examples. Really worth taking the time to browse through the book you get with the ticket which gives you more info on every object on display.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Cozy place with a good range of displays, some interactive. Nice place to spend an hour or two."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",1,Way too expensive. Way too little content.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Good Design, but mostly there's no prototype that showed up at the museum, just poster. But the voucher can be combined to buy some products or food at the cafe."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Visiting the design museum is a nice break from the never-ending luxury shopping set up around the Marina Bay Area. I didn't actually enter the museum exhibits, as from what I could see, it wasn't quite worth it. The layout within the small space appears to either show photography of said designs, or props the designs up in an almost retailesque manner. Not too engaging for my taste, but may be of interest of others. I think you can get the same experience from reading the purchasable book.

The shop is the best part - I found a few fun postcards to send back home and other interesting items."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,"Nothing special, a low resolution HMD and a talking robot who always complain about the network."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The Red Dot Design Museum was an exhilarating experience which showed off some of the most impressive design innovations the world has to offer. Everything ranging from non needle insulin injectors to a hairdresser-cum-iron box to robot pets that can control the entire house has been displayed in the museum. All in all, it was thought provoking and made me feel amazed by how far technology has come."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very diverse and fascinating exhibits, I could spend all day here. Lots of thought has been put into the selection of designs on display, and how design reflects human nature. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended 👍"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Really amazing experience! I wanna go to Marina Bay and found this place. Satisfying my eyes and cheap entrance cost, which you can get the book too."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Well curated, very informative exhibition. The space is smartly organised and projects nicely presented. Must go if you are designer or interested in the matter. Also cool museum store at the ground floor!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Nice place to chill.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Was so amazed with the museum! Though, the museum is not that big, the things inside they displayed was really fascinating! The gadgets that are very rare really made me WOW! Thumbs up for the RED DOT DESIGN MUSEUM as well as to the crew behind these expo."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,It's very costly restaurant near Marina Bay the 500ml coke price is 3:80 Singapore dollars.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Loved the museum. Was a bit apprehensive about visiting it but enjoyed the uniqueness of it. They do give out a handout that is very useful for in-depth information on the items on display. Gave it one star less because of less seating within the museum.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,One of the most amazing museum I’ve ever been to!! The rapid development of technology totally astonishes me for the first sight. Also the idea of human and robot coexisting in real life has never been so close to me which is enlightening.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Interesting exhibit they have on display here at this museum. Gift shop looks sparse, maybe they should bring in more award winning items to best represent the brand that they purport to be. The staffs were genuinely helpful, and answered all my enquiries graciously. Kudos to having a good team!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Provides an interesting insight into what the future of technology would look like. There were interesting dummy models and real life models to aid in conveying the message. The place also sells finger food such as cakes and rich dumplings together with drinks. Overall, I've had a positive experience."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I’m a designer myself, so I think I HAVE TO go to this museum once I go to Singapore and the museum was SO GREAT! I feel so inspired to make extraordinary design for a better living. Thank you!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"The museum is very small and the entry price comes with one of the gift shop books that can also be purchased on its own. Took about 20 minutes to walk through this very small museum. Not really worth the time, but the gift shop is nice to get out of the heat."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Great museum, especially after a walk along the bay. Discover some awarded design items and get some thoughts about automation and robots in our times. Very interesting!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,Nothing great. Can be given a miss.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,There are 2 levels of recent technology products that are exhibited here. People who love to have a quick look on the recent tech products should find this place a short and enjoyable getaway. The awarded designs are related to tech products and big data.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,There was a whole red dot in here! Wowzers! I mean the design in the place is wild! There was a bike and stuff! Cool!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Really great stop along the Marina Bay! I am an educator from the United States and found the Human Nature Exhibit intriguing. A complementary book for going through the museum was a great souvenir!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Really cool exhibits and I really liked the Life Stripe exhibit. Cute space! Would come back again
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,A unique concept store.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A fantastic place to spend quality time together with family. The displays were well considered and arranged nicely. My kids enjoy the robotics section very very much.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,This was a very interesting museum to explore! The exhibits got you to think a lot about the role of technology in our lives and entry came with a nice guide book that gave even more information on the exhibits!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"The museum is a hidden gem, relaxing and calming to walk around and see how as humans we have evolved with technology. I would have liked to see a bit more tho, given it is a small space, but the pieces are very interesting."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Small but cozy and relaxing museum
some are innovative cutting edge inventions
some are products found on the market
some are design products of arts and crafts
A great place to kill time
10% off of beverages with purchase of tickets"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Upon initial arrival, employees were friendly and professional! The exhibition itself was informative, thoughtful, and came with a complimentary book that I know I will reference in the future. I strongly recommend this museum to anyone who has interest in robotic advancement or has considered the balance, benefits and/or dangers in human-robot connections."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very nice little museum with very high density of design per square meter. Recommend.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"We went to Human Nature exhibition. We love Zenbo the educational robot the most. Overall, give us interesting insight of our home living in the future. It’s a futuristic  human sensory."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Innovation. Creativity. Take time to go around this unique, modern museum and get to be amazed by how one can be creative and innovative!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A welcome surprise.  I stopped in for the great museum store and was impressed by the low entry fee (11 SG) which includes  4 SG off purchase and a quality exhibition catalogue.  Very interesting and relevant exhibition about human nature technology design and the intersection thereof.  I wish the years of the objects were shown more prominently.  I’m sure the catalogue will have all the information and I look forward to reading.   I think having an audio  option for the most important exhibits would be additive to the experience.   Def worth a quick hour!  And great setting and opportunity to cool off.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,A good place to meet with latest gadgets. You can buy a lot of cool stuff.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This museum is amazing! The atmosphere is relaxing, and it will be nice to surf around when there aren't so many people. The exhibition shows plenty of items about technology, so it's suitable for anyone who likes the novel design."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"The content is very thought provoking. However  I feel there could be displays covering more topics
and in different  angles."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Other museums bring you back to the past but this one brings you to the future. Showcasing their red dot award participants’ works is a glimpse to what the future technology can be. Great place for people who likes gadgets and quirky items. Check out the museum shop to make it yours. Do taste the different local delights offered by the cafe in a quirky presentation.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very interesting material on design. Worth the price and got to keep the book guide that gives more information during the visit.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"A museum for design enthusiasts who want to learn more about design and what entails good design. The knowledge needs to be earned, and you will have to spend time there to read and observe the exhibits in detail if you wish for a fruitful trip.On top of that, the space is beautifully designed and has a thoughtfully curated retail area with products that are not commonly seen outside. It is good to take advantage of the cafe as well if you need some quiet time."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It was an interesting experience. I wish there will be more innovative products on display in the future
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Small but cosy , very Interesting. The book they included with the visit is very useful. I would have appreciated more Singaporean design. There should be a Section reserved for Singaporean designers (students)."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Very nice. Illustration of human and digital was amazing. Initially I thought it will be a boring one. But it’s not. You will not know how time went. I recommend to visit once ..
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,the museum was very informative and provided a more angled perspective on the human eye and technological vision. I especially loved the sensory phone case exhibition as well as a friendly encounter with the educational robot Zenbo.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Catch the Human Nature exhibition here on till September. Very thoughtful commentary looking at big data, health and impact of robotics on our lives, including robotic orchestral conductor and table tennis player. Although compact there are over 100 objects plus permanent collection, and entry comes with a comprehensive guidebook to keep for free, as well as 10% off food. The shop has done unique design products."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,For those who are into design
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"I found the architecture of this place to be intriguing. The shop itself is exudes a welcoming atmosphere as there are a lot of objects that blew my mind. The staff were helpful in their attempts to explain what Red Dot is.

As for the museum itself, for someone who doesn't really appreciate design, it has shown me how important design is. The food was also delicious and I would definitely return back for a cuppa with my mates!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It was a great museum near a lot of the other tourist attractions in Singapore! Would highly recommend. Gives a very interesting perspective on the evolution and future of technology.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Great collection of design items and well curated shows in a spectacular harbour side location. Interesting shop and helpful staff.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A really enjoyable exhibition. An interesting look at technological advancement in a wide variety of fields.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Very good and interesting place. Read the book , look at the photos and just be impressed)"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,"Nice designs on display, but mostly just posters of them rather than the actual items. A website of the items could serve almost as well. Admission fee is deceptive as the website says to ""pay as you wish,"" but the minimum ""as you wish"" was $6.40, Singaporean or not (despite the website only noting a minimum fee for non-Singaporeans)."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It is more like art gallery then museum as you can see all of the nice and creative awarded pieces. Worth to visit!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A very insightful and enriching visit! Definitely worth a visit for anyone because the topics touched upon are very much relevant.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Awesome collection
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,This place was unfortunately a swing and a miss. I had a different impression of it on the inside but it was kinda bland. The gift shop is quite nice and would recommend you hit that up to pick up a local souvenir. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend you purchase a ticket.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Such a fun experience. Also, they have a delightful cakes at their cafe. It's a must visit when you're visiting Singapore."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"from the outside, it doesn't look like much is happening but glad I stepped in. Its bright and airy and very busy. Exhibition is interesting, ticket comes with a book. Love the vibe, its a good place to hang out"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,Nice museum with a beautiful store. Interesting visit but could have been bigger
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",1,"Museum is a small collection of modern, publicly available products for sale at your local tech store. Waste of time and money. Wanted to see more about the design considerations, or even the engineering or physics principles would have been a start."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,A must Visit if u LIKE Technology. Can understand how it evolved. Also some pretty interesting findings in there is you look properly.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Love visiting the museum and their ever changing exhibitions! You'll be amazed at the Design talent waiting to be discovered. Worth checking out whether you're in the 'Bay area for shopping, food or just a stroll...in fact it's super hard to leave the Museum without buying something from the retail shop!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Pretty interesting museum concept with reasonable entrance fee, which can still be used partially as voucher for food and product purchases.
The museum shows some great inventions and cool designs of things you'd hardly think of. The museum shop offers a vast variety of products which received design awards (i think). We usually come here to get gifts for family and friends, as they are always unique presents. The food in the museums' cafe, offers delicious local food, which is presented in convenient cake-like slices. So its even worth to swing by for a tasty bite. For all this, the museum gets the full 5 stars!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This place is really good and cool. There are so many great designed stuff. You can buy whatever you want. And you can also drink beer outside of reddot museum. Price is quite good and the view is also very nice. So if you visit Marina area, you’d better be there to take a look of good stuff and to take a rest with iced beer."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"It is good place to watch the state of the art design in here. And you can also inspire the new way to make or create for your stuff:-)
So, it is good place to visit!:-)"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Average at best. I don't need to go to a museum to see an iPhone or a Google Home. I can see them anywhere. I would have preferred more unique items.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,the entrance ticket was included in my package. And i didnt look forward a lot. but it is good. You can see the future here. All state of the art things here. i recommend you to visit here.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Nice museum of a lot of cool modern product designs. But it's quite small.... Can be in and out within 30 mins. Costs about $10...

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Interesting interior, I had fun exploring and looking at the exhibits.The shop sells very interesting and cool stuff, I’m always tempted to buy something whenever I’m there. The cafe offers small bites which is kind of local and fusion, it’s very nice to just chill outside the cafe with a coffee or beer. Worth checking this place out!"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Good, small museum if interested in design and tech. Down by the harbour, nice way place to spend hour or two to catch an museum and coffee"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,It provides a good insight on what future tech is like & how it can change the way we live. Good place to visit when in Singapore
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Its just a bit wierd. Not been to the museum part, but the gift shop is over priced and has random stuff for sell (though some of it is interesting). Cafe is nice to sit at, and  well priced given its location"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,Ita almost a kilometer away from gardens by the bay.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,The place is for young individuals who want to see and get ideas from award winning designs. I recommend this place for everyone who wants to see the newest technology what won awards like the google home and apple watch
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Small but worth seeing. Conveniently located. Small permanent exhibition, interesting temporary exhibition about human and nature in various contexts. The pricey shop costs one star."

My favorite place was the cafe/bar which serves hot (and cold) coffee and most of all, ice cold craft beer! Set against the backdrop of the iconic Marina Bay city landscape, the cafe/bar is the perfect place to chill out on a hot sunny day. Highly recommended for tourists and locals alike looking to spend a fuss-free afternoon or evening in the city area."

I would have given it 10 stars if the option was available on this review.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Incredible product designs! Definitely recommend a visit.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,"You can easily skip it. Nothing interesting inside, quite small. We have got the tickets in a package with Gardens by the Bay so it was free. If you have to pay, rather go somewhere else..."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,This museum has a collection of recent red dot award winning products.  The collection is small but interesting.  A pleasant break from the Singapore heat.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,"Instead of bringing to life exceptional design by showing the ""real"" products they just show you the pictures along with some background information.

It was pretty small and was a collection of seemingly random products.They give you a guide book that has all the information about the products in it, but not a lot about the Red Dot award itself or how they choose the products that get the awards.  And the entrance fee was pretty pricey."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Museum is great! Very accurate and suggests a lot of interesting products and designs! I wish it would be longer
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"The winning designs of the Red Dot Awards are all displayed in the museum and with descriptions.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"A small museum but overall a pleasant experience if you got a little cash to splurge. Not for everyone. Most people will find this place a bit of a rip-off. But for open minded fact driven people, it's a cool place to check out new gadgets."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Beautiful and thoughtful museum on human nature and technology. Small with lovely exhibits!
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Rediscover Singapore 🇸🇬...
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"Speaking as a local. A very small collection of exhibits and rather underwhelming if you are making a trip downtown just to visit this one museum. That said, good design is good design and you might find yourself inspired by the award winners.

The cafe was a joy to chillax at. But the air conditioning needs more work, especially during midday. It was somewhat warm stuffy at some areas in the glass building."

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"Interesting place; get to see the themes that are pushing the product design game worldwide, across categories. Could do with more of an explanation in different places. Not too large a collection; can browse through in an hour. The gift shop is definitely worth a visit, but head to the museum if you're keen on design."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Great and fun museum. Cool gadgets and great stop along the way to the Marina
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Not cheap entrance fee, but definiteñy worthy if you are interested in design, and specially in industrial design. The human nature exhibition is interesting and presents a collection of robots and devices that will make you think how fast we are evolving in some matters, but how much we still have to learn about ourselves.
I wish there was some more interaction like trying devices, interacting with robots and more than just one VR set."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"Great way of spending time in Marina Bay. Nice interrior which helps you focus on displayed projects. Everyone can find projects for its own interest field.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,Must see in Singapore’s bay front area! The articulation of technologies symbiotic relationship with us will broaden your thinking.
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,This place is more like a cafe with a gizmo store.

But visit for sure if you want to spend your time at the cafe there

I ended up staying for an hour and a half just reading all write ups of the design projects. The location of the museum is quite good as well; there are a lot of places to sit and relax, and a nice surrounding area to take a stroll in."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",1,It is a very small place. All the exhibits are from oversea and most are from China. I think it is not appropriate to name the museum red dot design as Singapore is usually associated to little red dot. It may give foreigner a misconceptions that Singapore is associated to China as most of the exhibits are from China in a museum name that is associated to Singapore. I think it is more a design museum.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"The place was very minimalistic, it displayed different kinds of advance technology, and the staffs were also kind and approachable,"
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",1,Almost everything inside can be found in an electronics shop. No descriptions or details on any product; only product title. Expensive for what it is.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"With cold beer and funky bites at the cafe, it's an oasis at one end of the Marina waterfront.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",4,"I've been here three times before. Beautiful, iconic, red building where the Red Dot Design museum, as well as a few office spaces and bars are located. Nice place to explore. I've personally never entered the museum but I would like to one day, to see the collection of designs which received the Red Dot Design Award. However, the space does seem a bit cramped. I picked up a few design trail brochures here before, would say that this place is catered more for the office crowd and tourists. The Hopscotch bar is good and they do custom-mixed cocktails for special events."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",2,If you go to any decent electronic shop you will actually see more and better designed products. Nothing interactive. Just switched off electronics in glass cases. Disappointing.

"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",3,"The museum is not so big. I went there only to pick up the garden by the bay tickets. And it comes with free entry to the museum. I finished the exhibition in around ten minutes. I was hoping there were more real products showcase instead of the mainly cardboard information. And I thought there would be an exhibition of the red dot award winning product of the past years but there were not. They sell designer items at the shop but I was not able to choose one to buy. The ticket combo comes with a 2 or 4 dollars（not sure) vouchers for the cafe, but not for bevagers! A bit disappointed in terms of walking so far to the museum."
"Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore",5,"This museum have many IT items , other various design concept and cute production

Esplanade is really know what they're doing as they have professional team. Great, helpful and friendly team work that we're always grateful for. Practice hygiene by maintaining safe distance measurement for the audience by giving max number of 50 per session, cleaning the sitting area during the break so both the performer and the audience will feel safe to enjoy the music performance. Thank you and God bless Singapore!"
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"I'm reviewing on the halls instead of the whole esplanade itself. Honestly I didn't expect the grandeur of this scale as I thought it was more of a stage setting having watched 1 or 2 plays at this location. This time round I attended a piano recital piece, and I was in awe of the setting."

The concert and Theater halls are world class and the best in Singapore. There are many shops, cafes and restaurants at this venue, making it a very practical and complete venue.
There is also an outdoor theater next to the water, which creates such a beautiful atmosphere. There are always different cultural or arts showcases going on in Esplanade.
Very big parking space, means that even if more than one concert is happening at the same time, you will always find parking right at the venue and will not have to go looking for parking in other areas. Highly recognizable venue, especially as the Formula One race happens around this venue."

Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,4,Very nice walkway along the waterfront. If you don't want to take one of the river/harbour cruises you can still get awesome views of the waterfront walking along the Esplanade. The local hawker center was closed when I was here but was supposed to be open again by December. There is a small mall nearby with bunch of restaurants if you need to stop. The walkway continues all the way around to the hellix bridge & over to the marina bay sands.
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Being a musician, Esplanade is a place close to my heart. It's known as #MyDurian, an iconic building that all will recognise the moment they see it.

It's a place to promote musicians, bands, symphonies, choir for performance. It also hold regular free concerts for us to attend.

There's also library at the 3rd level where you can borrow many musical scores, CDs, books with a specialisation on music education.

There's also some shops which sells musical instruments as well as creative products that are made by Local Companies. The cafes, restaurants offers a good variety of mix of both local and other cultural delights.

To take a look of the Esplanade, you would like to go to Esplanade Bridge. It's especially beautiful at night.

#ILoveEsplanade"

Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,When there for toilet and taxi stand. 5 stars!
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Never really been inside the actual theatre for performances but based on location and scenery from the outside, it's amazing. Situated directly beside the marina and across the Merlion, it would be a great place for those who love photography. Shaped and sculptured alike to a durian, it is a refreshing view for those who've yet to see it in real life."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,Iconic building of Singapore. A must-have photo for your travels.
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed the evening here.  There was a series of performance that evening featuring The Tapestry of Music - tribal dance and musical instruments.  We were seated right opposite the event for dinner.
A great place to hang out, dinner and chat with friends.

We walked here from Chijmes through Raffles City!"
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Convenient access, beautiful arts and music performance"
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,Nice View! Near Merlion Park..
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,4,"This is where you can find the artistic side of Singapore.

There are lots of performances on weekend to inspire the young ones."

Lots of shops, free or paid exhibitions or shows at the Art Science Museum. There is a wonderful public library with books and resources specialising in the performing arts. Strolling around the water front to study the skyscrapers on the other side at Boat Quay or marvel at the fun architecture of the MBS hotel, the Art Science Museum and the Esplanade Theatre. Take lots of photos!"

Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,Best venue to spend your evening in Singapore. There is a light and water show with the beautiful symphony nearby Marina Bay Sands.
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Multiple venues for live performances of all genres and media.

Beyond the iconic twin durian domes, Esplanade has a number of other performance venues.

I have seen several performances at the Annexe Studio, most of them theatre or performance works made by local artists, arts collectives, and theatre companies. The air-conditioned Studio is spacious and flexible, accommodating a variety of performance types. In addition to live music, it’s a great place to catch works-in-progress by local artists, though it also hosts final productions by both traveling and Singaporean art-makers.

The Outdoor Theatre, which faces the equally iconic MBS complex, also hosts daily performances in a range of genres and media. Many of them are free and open to the public, and feature world-class local and international acts."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"A country worth visiting.  Safe, clean, highly educated, beautiful scenery, friendly people.  It is necessary to study Singapore on how the government works."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,Beautiful place
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"A world class theatre that offers variety of seating and halls/rooms. The main concert hall has a somewhat greater acoustic treatment than the Malaysia Philharmonic Hall at KLCC.

The bar serves beverages and snacks during intermission, with a beautiful view overlooking the Marina Bay and Singapore skyline. A great experience if you have a show in the evening."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Esplanade or some called it Gedung Duren, shaped like Durian Fruit is one of the best mall / photo spots in SG before MBS was built.
Located just around merlion park - helix bridge, MBS and raffles place its a must visited place in SG"
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,4,"A pleasant place by the waterfront for food and art. The shops on the ground floor are a bit sad and empty but hopefully the recovering economy will help visitor numbers. As of Jan '21, parking is free at the Esplanade between 12-3pm and 6-10pm."

Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"Theatres on the Bay (also known as the Esplanade Theatres or simply The Esplanade) is a performing arts centre located in Downtown Core near the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the nearby Esplanade Park, it consists of a concert hall which seats about 1,600 and a theatre with a capacity of about 2,000 for the performing arts."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"The Esplanade is a waterfront location just north of the mouth of the Singapore River in downtown Singapore. It is primarily occupied by the Esplanade Park, and was the venue for one of Singapore's largest congregation of satay outlets until their relocation to Clarke Quay as a result of the construction of a major performance arts venue, the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, which took its name from this location.

Apart from the shows, Singaporeans usually visit the Esplanade for its scenic outdoor view. It overlooks the Singapore river and is in between the Singapore Flyer and Merlion park, making for a good stroll around the vicinity. River ferries stops have been added recently, enhancing its accessibility"

Especially lively and vibrant environment on Friday and weekends!"

Surrounding this water mass is the financial district of Shenton Way housing many tall buildings and landmarks on one side. Most prominent is the Fullerton Hotel which was once the Singapore General Post Office. The building is more than 100 years old. The very intagrammable Merlion Statue is just across the hotel where there is an endless crowds of tourists and locals taking pictures and sharing it with the world. On the other side of the water is the famous Marina Sands Casino with the Helix bridge beside it. In it, you have the casino shopping center and many local and foreign F and B establishments. And not forgetting another icon, the Esplanade theater, more popularly known as the Theatres on the Bay. The locals called it the Durian because the spiky roof looks like a durian fruit. It's a wonderful place to take some stunning pictures of the bay and it's also a place where you sit and sip coffee and watch many bumboats go by carrying the millions of tourists every year. The night scene is simply stunning."

When the building model was first unveiled to the public, some thought it resembles insect eyes. Of course some of us are food crazy locals who prefer to associate it with durians.
Yet the architect originally depict it as a pair of microphones (aerial view).
🎨 Art is very much open to interpretation, and re-interpretation. Often, there is no absolute answers, just like life itself."
Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,4,"Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay is a performing arts centre located in Downtown near the Singapore River. it consists of a concert hall and showcases a number of free exhibitions in relation to performing arts. It's also worth checking on what is showing in the theatre and attending one of the performances. We unfortunately didn't have time but took a walk around the place and checked out the 'Game of life' exhibition.

Thereafter you can walk down towards the Singapore River for an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands (Picture in this review). We managed to catch the 9pm light show from the riverside and it was beautiful. You can even walk down the river and get to Merlion Park. An excellent way to cover majority of the sites."

A wonderful place to stroll around and get lost in though and a fee rare novelty shops to visit. There is occasionally, when there is a free exhibition, the 'Tunnel' which is located below the esplanade that leads to the mrt which can be asily missed if you arent taking the mrt to go to or from.

Esplanade Theatres on the Bay,5,"I had so much fun watching the free performances here! At the first night on Friday there was a 古箏 performance and on Saturday there was a chore singing Western classics.  With the cultural sphere these great and free performances create, no doubt Singapore is a culture hub of Southeast Asia.

The intention of building a permanent semi-outdoor theatre for performances here is remarkable. In my home city of Hong Kong, there is unfortunately no such thing in the cultural centre. When there's need for performance, they just build a temporary one. Singaporeans should be proud of their culture standing in the region. If I'm a Singaporean, no doubt I'll be a frequent visitor of this place!"

With more than 50% of the shows free to public, Esplanade is to make art accessible to the public. Come grab a sandwich during lunch and watch a live guitar ensemble for free. Just look for the monthly program highlights online.

How does the P&L work out for Esplanade in the marina Bay Area of Singapore, the most premium strip of real estate in the most expensive country in the world?

It doesn’t. The entire Esplanade theatre by the bay is a charity organization. What is free may not mean it did not cost (another dearly).

Qn: What is costing you dearly that you have now made free and accessible for others? #esplanade"

I have been to a few ballet performances held at the Esplanade and the experience is nothing short of being wonderful. The place is beautiful, comfortable with excellent acoustically designed performance spaces.

Within the building, sometimes there open exhibitions which one can visit without the need for a ticket.

There is a performing space just outside the Esplanade where events were held and is popular among the local and overseas crowds.

There's some nice restaurants in the buildings with excellent views. If you are in the area, do drop by. The walking path is also filled with beautiful views."

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall brings back a lot of fond memories of music concerts.

It's the favourite place to hold band concerts when I was young.

Sir Stamford Raffles Statue is found here as Raffles is believed to have landed in 1819.

The special lightings are being shown in August 2021 to celebrate our National Day.

#ILoveVictoriaTheatreAndConcertHall"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Extremely beautiful concert hall, especially when they decorate the hall full of battery operated candles, instantly uplifted the atmosphere and the ambience of the hall. First time watching a live Jazz performance in the form of a concert and enjoyed it fully!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Enigmatic and magnificent! The aura inside is amazing. Lucky enough to witness one of the beautiful candlelight concerts on Mozart's best compositions recently. It's a awesome experience which was filled with the grandeur and splendour of the 100 years old structure both inside and outside along with the Mozart's melodious rendition arranged by Fever.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Loved this place before the major renovation. Now the interior is too modern and a little too contemporary, it has lost much of its old charm."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Beautiful music + Beautiful layout = Awesome evening!
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"We had a good experience at the Victoria theater. The theater is comfortable, clean and had great acoustics."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Went for Mozart's Opera here. Was a great experience and place.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Such a lovely hall and nice architecture. Been there for concert many times and love it much better than concert at esplanade or mbs.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,A beautiful and quiet place for music lovers.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Attended Candlelight Concert - Mozart. Beautiful performance. Note: Zone B has the best view (on level 3)
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great and friendly staff. The venue is so beautiful especially when there are Christmas decorations around.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"One of the most chill places in the country. I would always come back here just to sit in this green field, enjoy a snack and witness a variety of events that would be ongoing all year long. This place has always something to keep you coming back. Whether it’s a music festival, an art festival or some food truck festival. It is extremely tempting, relaxing and very enjoyable.
If you happen to be in Singapore, I hardly recommend to check what would be happening here and not miss the life opportunity of attending it, because they rarely do the same fest twice."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Attended a children’s choir concert by SLO. Good acoustics in the concert hall. Chairs were comfortable. The width in between seats were very narrow, making it hard to move in and out. Got Row J seats. Realized that Row L have a walkway just in front and is roomy!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Went for a concert recently, a juxtaposition of old structure with the new. Nice place."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"What an incredibly stunning building! Victoria Theatre, formerly known as Town Hall, was constructed between 1855 and 1862, making it Singapore’s oldest performing arts venue. Certainly, an iconic landmark given its Palladian architectural style and 54-metre clock tower. Victoria Theatre, along with the Victoria Concert Hall, is gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992. Victoria Theatre is wheelchair accessible in the Stalls area. Do not miss the statue of Stamford Raffles placed in front of the clock tower!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,The ambience is great and staff took great effort to let the audience in n out by batches so as not to inter mingle dye to covid 19. The seats are also widely spread out. Good
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"My partner and I just caught a Candlelight Jazz concert here and the performance was stellar, but what made the experience truly unique and memorable was the delightful venue, both staff and ambience. I'm stoked to be back for the next one!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Not the best for piano acoustics but the. Again, its still awesome."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Covid-19 SMM in place but great ambience & cleanliness
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,A very nice theater conveniently located near museums and the downtown area. It's very easy to get picked up and dropped off via car here.The auditorium we were in had seats that were nicely spaced and comfortable. Definitely a good place to see performances.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Came for the very last Wild Rice performance a Christmas Carol and it sure didn't disappoint. Great venue for shows and performances, with wonderful acoustics and comfortable seating. Facilities are wonderful and will definitely be back."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Beautiful building with raffles statue in front. He was said to be the founder of modern Singapore. But actually Singapore was already a thriving trading port. Singapore's success is credited to God's creation to place it dead center between trading route between China, India(South Asia as the Straits Times call it.) and South East Asia. Better known as the Malay Archipelago, Nusantara.
But with the covid 19, Singapore got hit hard with Changi airport reduce to almost zero flights."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Victoria Theatre is as enchanting as the music played by Singapore Symphony Orchestra. It is situated in the heart of the city where anyone who visits the place will be treated with beauty of lights of high-rise office buildings the moment they step - out of the theatre.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,3,I was there last Friday but it was lock. Is it because ormf the lock down? Or they will open only at certain time (eg when there is a concert going on?) Without buying tickets can I visit the building?
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Money well spent in renovating and restoring the building
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"This is a very nice place with a long, rich history. You can enjoy a nice walk through the building or watch a performance with beautiful acoustics. Definitely worth a visit!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Excellent control of distancing measures, very fireman's extremely polite
Beautiful the way they choreograph the ingress and egress. Appreciated

Excellent acoustics, Beautiful place

Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Excellent location and vibe for local cultural festivals in a beautiful atmosphere. Whether it’s the festival of arts or the cocktail week the empress lawn with Victoria theatre as the background makes it classy!
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Unbelievable experience!! First time going to an iconic theatre and watching my daughter's performance. A proud parent...
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Beautiful place with a nice cafe. This place houses the clock tower with a very interesting past. The architecture comes from the colonial past, and recently refurbished and still looks as stunning now. Beautiful!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,This is my first time to a symphony concert. It was a very nice experience. The hall is beautiful and very much complemented the orchestra's performance.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A wonderfully restored concert location retaining much of the colonial charm and elegance, yet incorporating modern technologies in its facilities. The acoustics are warm and resonant and provides an excellent stage for chamber and orchestral performances."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Lovely architecture which houses a theatre and concert hall. Enjoy views of the river amidst a wide open area, perfect for picnics and relaxing."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Nice historical building with good acoustics. Events are always appreciated and of typically good quality.

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Where most of Singapore's classical concerts and plays are performed. Tickets are usually available via third-party online providers. The concert hall is beautifully decorated and have wonderful acoustics. Usually you can find flyers at the ground level to see the upcoming events.

Good for profile pictures too because of the architecture :)"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Night view is stunning. Memories of watching performances at both Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall. Victoria Concert Hall is one of the very few venues in Singapore with a pipe organ.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"This 150-year old performing arts venue is one of the oldest in Singapore. With its neo-classical design, it is an architectural masterpiece. It still boasts of the original piped-organ, in full working condition!!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Managed to catch the SSO here. Great location and the concert hall was good with great acoustics and views all around. The interior is marvelous, with the building and attraction on its own."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Watched Boeing Boing there. Extra ordinary acoustic.

Loved the place. No smoking  place nearby though."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,One of the most beautiful landmarks in the civic district. Well worth a visit!

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A great expo space, conveniently located centrally with a huge auditorium with excellent facilities, great sound system.  I was here recently to be a part of the Mind The Product Conference that was happening in Asia for the first time.  The adjoining restaurant, Sinfonia, might have lost its Michelin star with the chef moving to Italy, but the food was simple and gorgeous"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Beautiful Architecture with Theater
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Have your wedding here. It's lit
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Very fine dining place and beautiful venue to do wedding, good vibes after all!"

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Lovely place. Brings back memories of playing in a band back in my secondary school days.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Stunningly beautiful, iconic, historical architecture of Singapore."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Very beautiful place with good acoustics
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Great place, there was a concert I attended which was held in there, which gave me an excuse to go into this place.
Architecture is great, statues of colonial Brits everywhere.
And there's a restaurant inside that is actually pretty good, hence the 5 stars.
4 stars for the theatre itself, another bonus star for the restaurant."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Extremely magnificent
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Stunningly beautiful building with amazing acoustics, great place to bring the kids for the special musical events they hold here"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Building from the colonial times, famous tourist attraction and home of the SSO. Highly recommend to bring children there."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Well preserved an old-style architecture with a beautiful lawn.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Nice spot to take pictures
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Nice ambience, came here for a formula one event."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Extremely good acoustics and performances done by local artists! Very nice musical sounds and percussionist
Victoria Theatre Singapore,3,"Excellent theatre with top-end facilities. However the ticketing system is flawed: If you book via SISTIC (as most people do) you can only collect from approved collection points. The Victoria Theatre is indeed one of these points but IT IS CLOSED ON WEEKENDS. What a joke! So they have to write your ticket out by hand which took a long time and created a separate queue and made us miss the first few minutes of the performance (The Very Hungry Caterpillar).
Hope they can fix this issue as it was the only downside to an otherwise great show."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"The Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall (Malay: Teater dan Dewan Konsert Victoria; Chinese: 维多利亚剧院及音乐会堂) is a performing arts center in the Central Area of Singapore. It is a complex of two buildings and a clock tower joined together by a common corridor; the oldest part of the building was first built in 1862, and the complex was completed in 1909. The complex has undergone a number of renovations and refurbishment, mostly recently in 2010 when the complex was closed for a four-year renovation project. It reopened on 15 July 2014."

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Always love the acoustics at VCH

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Watched ""Boeing Boeing"". Proudly Singaporean style."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Quiet and peaceful place
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Lovely and unique venue
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Nice and cosy teather, but quite bad layout for seating"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,A Beautiful colonial building beside the river. Scenic and historic especially during the evenings. Nice place for a romantic walk along the river to the Bay. Not much going on inside the building unless you are watching musical plays or performances.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Caught a play by Pangdemonium here. Since renovation, the theatre and concert hall are absolutely stunning - modern, clean design, great facilities. Could imagine the place being a perfect backdrop for wedding photos."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Amazing theatre. Renovated to be ultra modern but still keeps all it old world nostalgic charm.

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great location for the staging of Dragonflies by Pangdemonium.

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,The conservation works on this building perfectly balances the old and new. Beautiful through and through. Perfectly pristine everywhere you look. The acoustics in the concert hall was also amazing.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"It's one of beautiful buildings in Singapore from old time.

Impresseive glass ceilings were added to make shelter to the (previous) outdoor parts of buildings.

In addition to usual concerts, the theatre itself is used also for seminars, which gives very good acoustics and ambience."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Beautiful building
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"One of my friends invited me recently to a concert here as she has bought two tickets. It is the second time that I attended a performance here. The place has a good ambience for listening to a concert. It is clean, peaceful and well-decorated."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great concert
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Beautiful place to visit
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Love the architecture and interior design of the building.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Good!
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Been there a couple of time, just a general feel that it is a rather small theatre, however maybe it suited the need back then (back in history time) and also maybe it is more suited for performance pure vocal art (without microphone), as any bigger it would be over challenging for the artists to perform that. Overall, the vibe is good. The staff there are friendly and general passionate too."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A lovely piece of history, with great architecture and acoustics in both the theatre and concert hall."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"This place is great for photoshoot, but there is not much spot. Usually there are some exhibition inside, sometimes you are not allowed to take a picture inside the building. Picture by me @lienardy.jpg, find me on Instagram!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Wow beautiful place.  Nice auditorium for average function gathering..  middle of the city.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,3,Saw a play here. The play was good but the audio set up nerds work. Pretty building.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Beautiful building with good toilets and many cubicles (very important for crowds). Only gripe is the gradient is pretty steep and we had to recline our necks pretty uncomfortably to view the performance downstairs, which over 2 hours really puts strain on your neck."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Wonderful place to be. Went there to attend a conference. The hall, seating, and acoustics were excellent. The architecture is amazing and gives you a royal feel. The restaurant served some great food and drinks. Located in the very centre of the locality so very accessible from all parts of the city and has some famous tourist spots nearby."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great .
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"It should be decades back since I last visited this place. Improved much while still preserving the old historic structures. Overall, really comfortable, serene place to unwind from the hectic, corporate life. 👍🏻😊"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,One of the most beautiful buildings in Singapore
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great architecture.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,a fantastic place in Singapore
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"A great place to watch some theatrical art shows and acts. A classical design building, very beautiful. I was there during the new year time and there was Madagascar movie going on in the lawn area on a big screen. Also there might be some good concerts to attend here and similar performance shows. There is a restaurant also inside this."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Went there to look around. It was pretty quiet not much activity there but i guess it woulf be different if there was a play or concerto performed there
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Home of the SSO (Singapore Symphony Orchestra). It is relatively small but the building is beautifully restored. Good acoustics in the Concert Hall
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Such a beautiful theatre! Gorgeous inside and out with lovely acoustics.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Love the historic place.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Been to the old Victoria Theatre. The new one still retains some of its old memories, from the chairs, to the decor and the structure. Like a marriage between the old & new Victoria theatre. Seats are comfortable. Not a huge theatre so visibility of the stage, even from circle seats, is not an issue"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Victoria theatre is amazing.  Visited it once when I was younger, and after the renovation it is beautiful. Highly recommended"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"A nice building, beautiful and seriously"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Retains its place in historic downtown Singapore. A nice place to walk past and remember the past with a building that’s been repurposed towards the future.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Amazing place! Beautiful outside and inside. If you have chance to visit this theatre, you should definitely do this!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,3,Watched movies thrice. Awsome experience. Nice place to go with family.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,I rlly love the interior design. A nice place to take photos while waiting for the play to start
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Awesome sound quality
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"It’s a place I grew up listening to all the best music pieces and events, from Choo Hoey to Joshua Tan."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,1,They have security staff going around telling everyone that picture taking isn t permitted within the internal building. I check the General enquiry and walked around the building for 5 minutes and never saw a sign that says no picture taking. I Don t understand how they apply this policy but I believe they apply the standards in a non consistent manner. Fundamentally if you are here for a event they wouldn t stop you from a selfie within the building but if you are here for a wedding picture they would probably chase you away without the proper guideline or standard. I recommend the management state and enforce the picture taking standard in a consistent manner.

The concert hall is used as a performance venue by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), and the complex is managed by The Esplanade Co Ltd. The Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Victoria concert hall ... excellent venue, more intimate than Esplanade concert hall. Personally I think the recent renovation is a little unsympathetic, but I was particularly fond of the look of the place when I first visited in 1999."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,A really beautiful place. Went to watch a choir concert and the hall had great acoustics! Their voices were very clear although I was seated near the back of the hall.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A beautiful and well kept theatre that's the perfect size for a performance. Small enough to feel intimate, but large enough to fit in enough people to bring up the energy levels. Good acoustics."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Went to see the symphony and plays, both spaces are great for kids and adults.  The central lobby can get a little packed before and after a show but otherwise a nice space."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,SSO Christmas concert 2017
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"The Victoria Theatre was a very beautiful place, with thank columns which makes the place look very grand. In the Victoria Concert Hall, there are exhibits that showed the  old advertising material, old seat backs before the renovation, the first seats in the Concert Hall, a mini version of the building and much more."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Beautiful architecture.  Looks even better at night when the lights are on.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Nice theatre with 500+ persons capacity. Very nice Odissi (Indian classical dance ) performance yesterday(13/02/2019).

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Very beautiful at night
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Lovely building with great architecture
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,nice architecture
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"This was the first time I had the pleasure of attending a concert in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation. I must say, I was most impressed with the improvements all round. The sound quality for one was a vast improvement to what it was.
The orientation and arrangements of seating was wonderful in that I felt every seat in the theatre afforded not only unobstructed view of the stage, but the round was just as good from any part of the audience seating."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Its inside the Singapore Symphony Orchestra Building.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,The best theater you can get in Singapore. British styled building with modern content. Just perfect
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Truly wonderful renovation that makes the old theatre new again. They've done a marvelous job creating it. When u see how modem and comfy i k
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,A nice theatre for  people to see concerts 👍👏
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A great place to catch some theatrical acts, symphonic orchestra or any other events especially after its refurbishment. Victoria Theatre holds a rich history that goes back to the colonial days and you can imagine that the exterior still looks pretty much the same as it did then.
Nice seating arrangements that gave a great view anywhere you're seated, and excellent sound design in and around the theatre.
From what I've seen there some pretty good backdrop arrangements as well for anyone looking for a venue."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Small cozy theatre, decent acoustics. Seats are in a long row with no centre aisle, so late-comers may be troublesome as they have to squeeze past you of you are seated earlier than them."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Beautiful venue, surprisingly smaller than expected but very nice. Great night out depending on the planned entertainment for the evening (obviously)"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"My sibling had a choir concert and we went to support him. The hall had great acoustics. The sound was clear and we can see the stage even from the back. It is not child friendly tho, if the child cannot keep silent. Since our 2.5year old child wanted to eat a biscuit and play with her toys, we had to sit outside the hall several times throughout the 2 hours concert and can just view from the screen beside the door.
(Please give a thumbs up if this review is useful. Thanks!)"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"i meet hideo kojima here for the death stranding game event, awesome"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,This theatre has excellent acoustics. I was here for my niece’s choir and the acoustics were excellent. Seats were comfortable.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Relaxing event..
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Spacious and clean room, but room design seems like 1950s"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Very old and vintage but with a touch of modern.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Neoclassical complex of 2 buildings and clock tower. It was completed in 1909 but the oldest part was built in 1862. The complex is used for public events, political meetings, musical performances..."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Recently watched theatre here.. =) the view from the center of upper level seat was moderate, sound system was moderate as actors sounded clearr. Enjoyed!"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Nice outside. Nothing much to see inside
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Nice aesthetic, regular concerts and shows"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Certainly a nice theater for performing art. Enjoy my time here even though the space can be a little small.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"For its classic architecture and nostalgia. The theatre is small... but even sitting at the corner, I've enjoyed watching performances there."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Beautiful exterior with a neat trim garden
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"The acoustics of this particular hall cannot compare to Esplanade - Theatres by the Bay, but are decent enough for a pleasant night spent attending a concert or a theatric performance."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Was here to attend my grandotter inter school band performance.  Cannot remember the last time I was here but place still has its nostalgia.  It's one of those unforgettable place.
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"Lovely place, walking up the stairs to circles are very nostalgic. The ambience of the lightings.

Really too bad the organiser has had Filipino staff. Was trying to get program guide for the performance and the way she told me the price is very condescending, as if $6 is too much to pay. So sad.

Staff of Victoria Theatre though is thumbs up..all smiles and so friendly. Loved it. Hope the organiser will train their staff well and learn from Victoria Theatre staff"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,The decorations were really beautiful and stately. Watched a play at the theatre and the acoustics were really good. Post renovations really gave it a cosy ambience and was very welcoming. Would definitely want to catch more plays and musicals at Victoria concert hall in future
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Great theater in a beautifully restored historical building
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"A beautiful building now that it has been completely revamped, hosting both a theatre and a concert hall. They've even redone the front to create a fairly expansive lawn. The sound quality of the concert hall, in particular, is greatly improved compared to the past. This presents a slightly more intimate space to view concerts and a a great venue in Singapore's expanding roster of arts venues."

Victoria Theatre Singapore,3,Good but cannot take picture inside
Victoria Theatre Singapore,1,"Attended a concert at the Victoria Concert Hall on 23 Feb 2019 (Saturday). It was my first visit to this locale.  The concert hall was rather small and the lifts took a long while before they finally enabled you to your choice destination. Further, the concert ushers, in particular an elderly male; was especially rude and unhelpful - I had to go to first level to collect my tickets even though there was a booth on the second level... Total waste of time, indeed.. This is a succinct reflection of backward technology..  Disappointing 👎"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,Historical value but inside is modern
Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"A beautiful building which bring back memories. It's great for both tourist and local, regardless if you are watching a performance or just hoping to take a picture. One downside however, is the lack of F&B options in the building."
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,Enjoy and appreciate the classical music performance by Singapore Symphony Orchestra at a iconic concert hall that is part of the Singapore history. Right in front of Victoria Theatre was the location where Raffles first landed in 1819.

Victoria Theatre Singapore,4,"Newly refurbished and retaining the old iconic architectural features of our colonial past this place is worth a visit even if you are not attending a theatre performance or a concert.

Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"(Translated by Google) The performance here is very close and it is worth looking forward to. The hardware facilities are well maintained.

(Original)
在這兒的表演，是很緊密的，也很值得期待。硬體設施維護的很好。"
Victoria Theatre Singapore,5,"(Translated by Google) I only looked at the outside of this theater. It is beautifully located on Esplanade Park next to the other colonial buildings. There are actually 2 buildings and 1 clock tower, which are connected by a common corridor.
The history of its origins is interesting and certainly very rare: initially only 1 of the 2 buildings was built and opened as the town hall in 1862. In 1893 this town hall became too small, the need for a large theater and concert hall was great, and the city council moved out. In 1905 a building with the same facade was completed right next to the former town hall, the Victoria Memorial Hall, which served as a theater and concert hall. In order to give the two buildings a common perception as a whole, the 54 m high clock tower and the corridor were added in 1906, which for the first time combined them into a single building.
The last major renovation ended in 2014.
From the Roof Top Infinity Pool of Marina Bay Sands on the 57th floor you have an indescribable view of the Victoria Theater and its charming, colonial surroundings, see p. Attached photo.
Immediately in front of the clock tower is a statue of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore and British Malaya, on the Empress Lawn by a basin.
The Victoria Theater is considered one of the National Monuments.

(Original)
Ich habe mir dieses Theatre nur von außen angeschaut. Es liegt wunderschön am Esplanade Park neben den anderen Kolonialbauten. Es sind eigentlich 2 Gebäude und 1 Uhrturm, die durch einen gemeinsamen Korridor miteinander verbunden sind.
Die Entstehungsgeschichte ist interessant und sicher sehr selten: Es wurde zunächst nur 1 der 2 Gebäude gebaut und 1862 als Rathaus eröffnet. 1893 wurde dieses Rathaus zu klein, der Bedarf für eine große Theater- und Konzerthalle war groß, und die Stadtverwaltung zog aus. 1905 wurde dann ein Gebäude mit gleicher Fassade gleich neben dem ehemaligen Rathaus fertiggestellt, die Victoria Memorial Hall, die als Theater und Konzerthalle fungierte. Um den 2 Gebäuden zu einer gemeinsamen Wahrnehmung als ein Ganzes zu verhelfen, wurde dann 1906 noch der 54 m hohe Uhrturm und der Korridor ergänzt, was sie erstmals zu einem einzigen Gebäude verband.
Die letzte große Sanierung endete in 2014.
Vom Roof Top Infinity Pool des Marina Bay Sands im 57. Stock hat man einen unbeschreiblichen Blick auf das Victoria Theater und seine reizvolle, koloniale Umgebung, s. Foto anbei.
Unmittelbar vor dem Uhrturm steht auf dem Empress Lawn an einem Bassin eine Statue von Sir Stamford Raffles, dem Gründer von Singapore und British Malaya.
Das Victoria Theatre gilt als eines der National Monuments."

Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,5,"Excellent place to understand about history, heritage and culture. The volunteer guides and staff are fantastic in terms of being helpful and knowledgeable.

The current exhibition on the evolution of female fashion in China and the region is quite fascinating."
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,5,"Lovely historic villa home with long historical significance in Singapore as the base for Sun Yat Sen, one of a number across SE Asia. The history is well displayed and explained. Many photographs give images of Singapore 100 years ago, with historical context. Multimedia displays provide a timeline to understand the movements of Sun Yat Sen, and at the same time the final decades of the last Emperor period in China.

A separate exhibition area inside shows rotating exhibits. I was fortunate to see Modern Women of the Republic, Fashion and Change in China and Singapore, a history of women's fashion from the 1920s on the Shanghai Bund, through to modern styles of 1960s. Beautiful garments, photos, magazine covers, and large boards discuss the societal changes and cultural significance represented in fashion.

A quiet place to immerse yourself in a bit of history for an afternoon."
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,4,"If you’re not Chinese decedent, this museum exhibit may seem alien. It’s small enough that you can stroll in half an hour. Although they have tried to put things in timely order, you’ll see so many names and faces that aren’t familiar. it’s hard to join up into pieces on who is doing what and how they relate in the historical events."
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,4,Every pictures tells a story and history. Glad to be able to drop by the museum for a good browse into history.
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,5,"Though it's a memorial for Sun Yat Sen, I learned a lot about Singapore's early years, different educational institutions, trade federations as well as clan associations. Good thing is that it's free for Singaporeans with guided tours at specific times. Air-conditioned inside with a small beautiful garden with swings on the outside.

Definitely a good place to spend an hour or two if you're in the area."
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,5,"Had my staycation at Ramada and Sun Yat Sen Nayang Memorial Hall happens to be just right behind zhongshan mall. Its just a 5mins walk away.

Admission is free for Singaoporean and PR. There are few guided tours available per day at selected time.

This museum is spread out across 2 levels. I would say that its a good place to learn more about the history of the Singapore chinese community as well as the story of Dr Sun, an iconic chinese revolution leader. There are alot of intresting artefacts on display."
Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall,5,Love this simple White House that was housed with lotsa information and the ambience was nice. Cleanliness was great too. Went for the scribble town exhibition which was a small exhibition but with enough information to educate the children.

Current exhibit on photography studios of the past is rather small (probably won’t need too much time to cover it all), but it offers a nice nostalgic journey for the seniors, and glimpse to how photograph is developed in the past before the time of digital cameras. Good for an hour plus to hang out at Balestier."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Been wanting to see the Tang Shipwreck so I'm happy.  Very grateful the govt is encouraging its residents to be more interested in museums by offering free entrance.

Also wonderful to see the government promoting and helping local arts professionals and designers."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Visited the Asian Civilisations Museum on a weekday afternoon. There are many free exhibits at the permanent galleries for citizens and some periodical paid exhibits at different times of the year.

Enjoyed seeing numerous artefacts which predates to centuries ago. Enjoyed the Tang Shipwreck gallery!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Excellent exhibition in the museum. Well preserved items. The exhibition galleries walkway abit confusing. But there are friendly staffs will help you out. Level 2 with Asian Religious exhibition is very interesting, could seen the items up close. I did learn quite a few things from there, from Buddhism, Christian, Islam and Hinduism.

The ship wreck is very interesting exhibition too.

I love their jewellery exhibition too. It not only display the items but shown how its worn on a person. Which we sometimes have no idea how it looks like."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the best contemporary museum in Singapore. Highly recommended for  visit. The artifacts are carefully and professionally curated
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of the four museums of Singapore. A good collection that focuses on SE Asia religions, and culture, with a section devoted to maritime history. Nice spaces for special exhibitions. The architecture is well preserved classic style and the building has a couple of floors but isn't as large as the National Gallery next door."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The security guards were very helpful and helped visitors in their directions and queries.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A very cool place to learn more about Asia culture with so many exhibits. You will spend about 2-3 hours here if you want to carefully look at all the items.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Super interesting. I would have loved to do it with a guide as i believe there’s a lot of information to grasp
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Thanks to my impromptu visit to ACM recently that sparked my curiosity, ignited my eagerness to learn more, appreciate more about art and history.

From artefacts from shipwreck to the precious ceramic pieces from various dynasties; small exhibition of calligraphy to the finest fabric, hairpiece, to name a few.

Here, a place for me to glimpse into the past for its glory, rich culture, heritage, and many more. I had an amazing time here.

Tips: Solo visit/ visit with a like-minded friend is recommended. Take your time to enjoy and appreciate what each piece has to offer.

Big big love x 💛"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Nice museum in a heritage building and historic area. Good permanent exhibitions of antique trade ceramics and various other religious and culturally important antiques. With a focus on Chinese, Indian and Southeast Asian antiquities."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Never realised this is such an amazing museum to go, I personally think this is the best museum among all museums in Singapore. Huge collection of historical piece among Asian (mostly eastern and Southern Asia). Free for Singaporeans and PRs, but not to the special exhibition."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Enjoyable place. Level 3 is kind of dark and spooky if you are the only one.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Enjoyed the museums exhibits, not too crowded"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Visited on Monday and pleasantly surprised that there us no crowd at all. Unlike my previous visits, I was able to take my time to go through the exhibits.  Free for Singaporean!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The Russel Wong Kyoto Life in Edo photography exhibit was wonderful. Don't miss it. Paired with Japanese wood cut prints. Beautiful black and white images of Geisha. This is a special exhibit that won't be there long. The lighting team did a great job. There is also an accompanying video to the exhibit. Definitely go and catch it. The other ACM collections are also wonderful. A great museum and Singapore is lucky to have it.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The trip to the Asian Civilisation Museum was really cool. There are several exhibits that are truly amazing. There is so much history you can see and learn about, which is quite special. It was interesting to learn about Singapore’s history as well. The building is historic and the government has really done an amazing job in renovating it."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The exhibitions are expansive across asian cultures, with enough variety and depth to sate your curiosity. The quality of exhibits is generally high though there are a number of pieces that don’t seem to have that much underlying research or that specifically add value to the exhibits they are in. However most museums have such issues so I would certainly not fault it.
The layout of the exhibits could be improved, though. The flow of information is not particularly smooth such that fundamental concepts/ideas may only be explained more in the middle of the exhibit (eg headhunting, which was referenced a lot in the rituals etc section, was only elaborated on in the middle of the exhibit. Its not a terrible issue, but is not particularly conducive for education.
The building itself is beautiful and well maintained.
The main issues are that there isn’t parking within or even very nearby, and if it rains there is no shelter at all so you would be stuck. There isn’t a sheltered taxi stand nearby either, so you’d also be stuck. Its a function of the heritage building, and I wouldnt want shelters surrounding it anyway, but it’s something to consider when visiting!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Informative learning experience here! FYI — water bottles aren’t allowed, you’ll have to leave them by the internal entrance!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very interesting meusum with a rich collection of beautiful artefact but highly recommended to take a guided tour for an enriching experience
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Visited the Asian Civilisations Museum this afternoon. The Museum is spread out over 3 level. Each level has its own theme. This Museum was first open back in 1997 and have been in this current premises since 2007.

Trade and Maritime Silk Routes. This gallery tells the story of trade, one of the focus was on the Tang shipwreck. Ceramic, gold and silver were on displayed that were recover from the shipwreck. Faith and Belief, my favorite gallery among all. This gallery tells the story on religion. Lots of religion related artefacts on display. Materials and Design, is more on the decorative arts. On display are costumes from the early years and its development.

Worth visiting, would take at least a few hours to cover the entire 3 stories. Lockers are provided on the first level for patron to store their items."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of my favorite museums in Singapore. Not only are the collections interesting, I also like the building architecture and the location of museum by the Singapore River close to Marina Bay.

I love the Chinese ceramics sections and it is interesting to see the artifacts and items from the Pacific Ocean cultures that are less well-known compared to their ASEAN counter-parts"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Tip: Check Klook for cheaper admission fees

Bought a package on Klook that included an envelope of free items and discounts. The special exhibition (Life In Edo) was neat.

If there is one thing to improve on, it would be the text contrast. It was easier to read black text on white. White text on red, red text on grey and white text on grey was a little hard to read for some exhibits.

Overall, great musuem to visit!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Loved the experience at ""The Asian Civilization Museum"", which is under the National Heritage Board of Singapore. The approach via can was not direct as I was dropped off about 100m away from the main entrance, but it was a good walk after a long cab ride!

I booked my ticket through ""Tiquet"" app and got S$2 discount on each ticket at S$6! The outside was maintained well and place was tidy and clean. The ticket redemption counter was fairly easy to navigate and the staff were pleasant and helpful.

There were 3 levels and each level was filled with different aspects of cultural artefacts and ancient items from different centuries. ""The Tang Shipwreck"" was a standout for me and loved how the entire area was set up, so KUDOS to the Curators!!

It was a long walk across all 3 levels, so do bring comfortable shoes. We were able to cover all three levels and was impressed with everything I saw. I wonder what is the significance of the ""Directors Pick"" was - noticed several items with a red banner against a number of the artefacts."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Just permanent exhibition -6 dollars( exincluded special exhibitions)

Just visited there when raining day.
Chinese , religion , clothes,Interesting exhibition!
Architecture is splendid and beautiful with Marina Bay archi view.

Definitely visit again. And I will join Docent tour.😀"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A truly remarkable experience. Learnt important facts about Singapore's close Asian neighbours such as Thailand, Indonesia as well as other Southeast Asian countries such as India and of course, the giant of Asia, China.

An understanding of how the civilisations of this region evolved with the influence of various religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism Islam and Christianity during the course of history, their trade relations etc., can be gained from the innumberable artifacts and the detailed descriptions that accompany them.

We were fortunate to participate in a guided tour - the volunteer museum guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. Her explanations were very helpful to deepen the understanding about the exhibits.
One day is definitely not enough to study and enjoy all the remarkable exhibits on display. Definetely will be visiting again.
My family had a most enjoyable time at this museum.
Have been too busy looking at the artifacts and reading their descriptions. Therefore only a very few photos could be taken. May be next time l will be able to get more photos."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I give it 5 star because the Museum was very organized with its information on each artifact.

I was attracted to the jewellery section with them diamonds 😅

It was an okay activity for me as i am not a museum person. 😬"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Russell Wong Exhibition@ACM is totally worth it.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Persons who are interested in history and seeing things from the very past this is an amazing museum. I really enjoyed seeing porcelainware found centuries ago as well as the chinese jewellery. Many exhibition are awaiting for you.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The exhibit from Russell Wong was absolutely breathtaking. Loved the rendered prints and how they were presented.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A variety of collections. Suggest 2.5 hrs, if not  3.5, to visit each area."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Very informative trip to the museum. Good information on trade routes of S.E Asia, things that were traded, information about traders, the way people lived, their clothes, jewellery, religion and ritual materials. It took us 3 hours to complete as we went through everything. Wear good shoes. Discount for NTUC members. Carry your ntuc card."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A Must visit musuem in Singapore.
Very well organized artifact and categories of antique. Learned so much on the tourl"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,It was great experience! Especially second floor with all the history of religion.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazing space as always with the set up and different art forms
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice and informative experience. There was a large range of exhibits. They were clearly laid out with informative placards.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great place to spend about half a day going thru the 3 floors of various exhibits to learn about Singapore,trade and maritime history and many more.Free for Singaporean ( on this date of review 13/12/2020)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A lovely place to take students and overseas visitors. Enriching and informative.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Went to the ACM recently, and man! I LOVED IT! For historical geeks, this is a must go. The Ancient Civilisation Museum has religious and racial artefacts, and covers many different time periods. The exhibitions that they have now are very very VERY intriguing. The fact that this is free for both SGeans and PRs is unbelievable. The place is very quiet on weekdays, so it’s ideal for a simple date with your s/o or even one of your friends. I learnt so much from my 3-4 hours there. And the ambience is just amazing. If you need to take a break from everything, this is the place. No one will disturb you. Just you and these artefacts stuck in time."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place with a lot of artifacts for kids to learn.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great to have free entry for all Singaporean!
Very clean and nice ambience to know about history!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Overall a very interesting museum that houses lots of exhibits regarding asian history and culture. Covering niche topics like ceramics, religions, and items of importance of that era. Only downside, is that its too big unless that's your thing"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Best museum ever!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of my favourite museums in Singapore,  can spend half day here."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,you can see amazing good stuff
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Feeling great cycling by the Singapore River.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Loving the new look.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This museum is a wonderful place to lose half a day easily and I did! Great, well run museum with excellent staff. The whole experience was educational, informative and fascinating. Loved it and will return one day."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Awesome place for history lovers!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of our centre’s important programme took place in this place. High profile delegates talked about Singapore’s future planning and design for 2060. Very nice place. Aristocratic environment inside. We enjoyed the food.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"ACM is my favourite museum in S'pore, the collections are well curated and expanded significantly compared with my first visit 5 years ago. For sure, the treasure from Balitung shipwreck, ceramics and porcelains as well as artifacts of life and religions and interactions of people in Southeast Asia and beyond will make a worthy museum experience"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Cool place to visit 👍🏻 Current exhibition is on Japan during the Edo period + Russel Wong Japan photography and its quite interesting! 🇯🇵
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,This museum is a cultural must-see for all non-Asians. It educated me on the incredible cultural and trade contributions of the Asia worldwide. The antiques there must be seen to be believed!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"In the middle of the face to heightened a lot I visited this museum. I recently gone back to academy and without checking anything, on my word and an email they gave me the student discount. Well managed and priceless art. Hi really love the japan show and the photographs taken by russell wong. Bedrooms sometimes are very cold but the quality of the exhibits and the paintings are really outstanding is is a must-see exhibition and museum for anyone, one can easily spend about an hour and really enjoy the time"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Most extensive and expensive collection of South, East and South East Asian artifacts in the region."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I like the place and how they display the item and the information given next to the item is very clear and easy to understand 👍👍❤❤
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Free for local nice place to hangout as there isn't too many stuff going on and usually not pack. A good place to spent 2-3 hours. Look out for special exhibition happening on and off
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A museum that is not boring at all. Relatively short visit 1-2hours and is always quiet and nice. Not many people around. The bookshop has interesting volumes for kids
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Those pictures are from the riverside and its next to the museum. The view was amazing. Wanna go back there once again 😭 already miss the vibe
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Worth a visit, but it's better to plan two or three of your the kind of person that likes to read all the explanations."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Many interesting artifacts
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Perfect for a late morning outdoor photoshoot, even with the hot sun."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Free for all Singaporeans, very thankful for this initiative. However, a few things to take note. The 2nd level showcase on religious artifacts emits a rather tense and negative energy. Not too sure if is because we went at night, but it just don't feel right when we were inside. We got out in less than 5 mins. So probably try to visit during the day."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I absolutely enjoyed my time here. There are quite a number of exhibitions here, and you can easily spend 3 hours here. That is, if you are interested in Southeast Asian history. The exhibition on the maritime trade in the past was quite interesting. I loved the big and bright open spaces. There were also exhibitions on how the different religions spread across the region, and that was interesting to learn about, especially Christianity. There is also the special exhibition on Raffles which ends this weekend. It would be good to catch it if you have not. Students get free admission."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Nice building and a very good and extensive collection. I liked the museum very much, as from the part in Europe I live the Far Eastern and Southeastern civilizations are not very well represented. I like the Indian and the Chinese artefacts the most. A must-see museum when in Singapore"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Various galleries to explore,  including permanent exhibitions featuring ancient religions, religious statues and relics etc and temporary exhibitions like Russell Wong's photo exhibition of Japan and ancient ukiyoe prints as well.  Super good aircon."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Very well maintained historical museum on topics mainly about China, India, Malay Archipelago artefacts, fashion, ceremonial pieces and ornaments from the 16th to 18th century. Thematic organisation is generally well thought out and easy to follow"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great experience and lots to learn! Got a chance to join the free guided tour. Guide was knowledgeable and we learned a lot about the history of the 4 main religions in Singapore during our 2 hours there 🙂👍🏻
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Enjoy a slab of ice cream wrapped in wafer biscuit or rainbow colour bread after your visit to the museum, sold by an elderly couple near the Anderson Bridge."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Awesome ! Went there specifically to visit Russell wong in Kyoto/ Life in Edo exhibition. However some exhibition halls are very dim.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Lots of interesting exhibits. Tang shipwreck is the obvious draw but the rest of it are very good as well if you take time to read the descriptions. Enjoyed the trade and religion sections especially. Young kids will probably be bored though.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,An informative museum right in the central business district and by Boat Quay. Sizable exhibitions with some changing themes. The building itself is quite nice with couple of more upscale restaurants to satisfy ya bigger hunger or to treat yourself with some nice coffee and dessert. Outside the building you’ll find the Mirror Balls that are fun photo objects as well.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I am awed by the exhibitions the Asian Civilisations Museum has, especially those artefacts from the Silk Road era, like porcelain items from places like Jingdezhen and Changsha. I am also impressed by how ancient people makes carpets and various items in a detailed way."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Very enjoyable experience, students enjoy free admission to all exhibits (permanent and special) and there's a lot to see so I would highly recommend!"

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This museum stages a variety of exhibitions throughout the year. It is very well signposted with easy access. The museum is well laid out, and has a cafe offering all kinds of drinks and snacks.
In April 2018 the exhibition featured Ankhor Wat and the photos here reflect that."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Really interesting museum. It has very detailed thematic displays from around South East Asia. My favourite part was the Indonesian shipwreck (its cargo to be precise). You can easily spend around three hours or so here. Definitely recommended. The ticket also gives you entry to the Peranakan museum which is also worth it.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Interesting exhibition. Love the minang House roof wood plank, and the many Buddha stones.
The peaceful feeling, nice ambience. Will go again!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) is the only museum in the region devoted to exploring the artistic heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans.

It's very clean and spacious and they have a lovely space to hold concerts performed by students from Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music on a regular basis.

The night view is extremely beautiful because it's located along Singapore River.

There are a few restaurants there including Empress and Prive which you can dine in. The atmosphere is very relaxing.

#ILoveACM"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Interesting exhibits. Day pass allowed for us to take a short break and return to the museum to finish our visit. Learned a lot of history through ceramics which was fascinating as usual. There were several pieces not on display cause they were in the middle of changing exhibits, and the 3rd floor was off limits for renovation... but, overall, a nice experience."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Wonder why Buddha sits in the middle of a cross? Fusion new religion, or relic of a darker past? The answer would surprise you. Of course, this is clickbait to visit and support the museum. Gain that new insight, and earn your right to show off."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This museum is gorgeous!
ACM locates next to Clarke Quay; you can take a nice walk from either City Hall or Clarke Quay MRT station to the museum. They have a very nice collection --- especially things from South East Asia.
-The cafe in the museum is very nice too. Go get a cup of coffee or try their afternoon tea after the exhibition :)
-They provide free lockers in the museum (if you don't have any coins, the staff will lend you a coin, then return after you take your stuff out. I'll say this is not common cause most of the museums in other countries will require you to get your coins by yourself :p)
-The current special exhibition they have about Japan is lovely, highly recommend ppl to visit it!

Besides the museum itself --- ACM also provides a lot of online experience these days. They have so many nice events on PEATIX --- I've tried two workshops so far, it's well-organized; all you need is to call in via zoom, ACM even deliver the toolkit to your house :)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"this is a great museum that bring us back to historical zone in Asia. They can serve us many tribes in Asia. Yes, mainland and archipelago. from north to south, from east to west. The tour guide is amazing. She told us every detail of a zone. about their history and culture. This museum also provide tour book so we can understand easily.

The architecture is British type. We can also selfie and take photograph inside as good as outside.

Easy to reach this place. I thinks this place is so great."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"It’s a great museum, collecting the one of most well known Belitung shipwreck..."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A beautiful museum with a massive collection of exhibit items. The museum also covers extensively the histories of different peoples, including the Minangkabau people and the Peranakans. A really fascinating museum to spend your day in!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The best museum in Singapore city,  ever!
They're are a great collection of ancient Asian art from China,  India,  Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and others.
Beautiful architecture and stunning exhibitions make you stay all day inside that wonderful museum."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Air conditioned museum on the various Civilisations in Asia, including exhibits on China, trade routes, the Indonesian islands, etc."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Brought my 2 boys (12 & 4 yrs old) to ACM on Fri 23 Dec 2019. Came for the Mr Dragon kids event. It was crowded with other kid's activities and my older boy said he enjoyed it more than the National Museum. The other exhibits are behind glass cabinets, so no security officer eye balling us every where we go. We could explore in peace. The place is crowded with parents and kids, as well as teachers and kids."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"1/2 day tour was enough. I felt I walked out of history books through the different historical items that I saw in each level! Imagine seeing Chinese bowls recovered from vessels before Christ was born!

It felt eerie in the 2nd level as lights were dim and statues were displayed from different beliefs. But the different tomb markers tickled my interest!

Different jewelries fascinated me in the 3rd level. The other portion was under renovation when I was there 23rd of March. So it was a bit disappointing.

It was an enriching afternoon for me!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Nice to learn about asia. Good exhibition, but small versus other museums you might know."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice place to enriched yourself from arts and history
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Particularly loved the Buddhism collections and special exhibition. Very informative. Keep an eye on their website for special event as we got a handful of gifts for small children (and a free milk tea as well!)
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Very good historical place for all ages.The anthropology and ancient religions, is very interesting as there is a guided tour of the Southeast Asian Gallery (aka the Ancestors and Rituals Gallery) which is so informative. The Guo Pei exhibition is amazing which  exhibit the ancient dresses with intricate beadwork and embroidery.Very well curated artifacts. The place is very well taken care,very clean and bright.The surroundings is very beautiful as it is located by the Clark Quay and so peaceful.The Colonial preserved historic structure is so charming.Classy cafes and gift shops nearby is to look out for."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A real treat to history lovers. Has all kind of religious and trade history of Asia in a well preserved way. Loved the experience. No need of any tour guides. Everything is explained in the guide. Make sure to collect one at the ticket counter.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"If you are interested in anthropology and ancient religions, this is a must see.  We had the pleasure of doing a guided tour of the Southeast Asian Gallery (aka the Ancestors and Rituals Gallery) which was super interesting and informative.  We spent well over two hours here and I could've looked around longer.

There are also small lockers available to stash your stuff while you're looking around so if you just have a backpack or a very small carry-on (the lockers are fairly narrow) this is a great option for killing time before an evening flight."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"If the Raffles Hotel and Fort Canning Parkhaven't satisfied your taste for colonial architecture, pay a visit to the Empress Place Building. It was constructed in 1865 and built in the Neoclassical style, and was named in honor of Queen Victoria. It now houses the Asian Civilisations Museum, which delves into the many Asian cultures that helped form Singapore. The museum's collections focus on the themes of trade and spirituality, both of which heavily influenced Asian cultures and served as vehicles for the cultures to spread. Exhibits include topics like Indian Ocean trade, stories of faith and belief, and a look at the important role that scholars played in Chinese culture for centuries."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Good photography exhibition on EDO era. Probably too monotonous as several photos/scenes have  taken more then half’s of the exhibition. Nice collection of block prints plus the opportunities to visit the permanent collection
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Beautiful Museum in the river side, Never forget to get your snap in front of the huge silver balls.
Visit during the day time to enjoy the most."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A tremendously interesting and beautiful collection of historical objects with thorough descriptions elaborating on their origins. I was fascinated and delighted by the craftsmanship of artists hundreds and even thousands years ago.
The museum lay out and presentation is excellent."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Lovely museum. Highly recommend the rooms of primitive religion. Not particularly primi6, but beautiful Buddhist and Hindu statues and a small display of impressive weapons"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Level 3 is currently under renovation but Level 1 and 2 is enough to entertain you for hours. I like how the artifacts are placed and reading are made simple. Lots of benches within the museum so that people can take a rest too. Currently there is an exhibition on a shipwreck found near Singapore and from the artifacts and descriptions, you can get a feel of how people on the ship lived and the risks they had to take to make a living. ACM is located  near the fullerton hotel and the river which offers scenic sights too. A good place to include as part of your itinerary."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"A thematic museum with a good selection of Southeast Asian-focused items. Currently the Raffles exhibit is running. Conveniently located near the Raffles Place mrt, it has a number a of food and beverage options near if you feel hungry after walking the museum.

Recommended for visitors to Singapore."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I came here for a school field trip on a guided tour. Honestly quite a nice place, it has quite lot of history to it. It was nice seeing the beautiful artifacts and paintings. However, the second level was mostly about Buddha and it's statutes. ( I was abit bummed out) However, at the entrance of the second level, there were Chinese calligraphy that was opened to the public for free. It was pretty fun, may come again if the school makes it compulsory."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place to spend a few hours if you have the time to spare
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Most informative and enjoyable museum. It was well organized and displayed with plenty of information. Particularly enjoyed the shipwreck exhibit.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Modern chic and a good blend of Singapore's historic beginning of becomming a nation

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Asian civilization artifacts dating back more than 2000 years. Well worth visiting. Small sample collections from the Asian region. From India to Afghanistan China South East Asian. Well organised collection of fine art works. Interested cross cultural influence between East and west. Art works from Hindu Buddhist Christian Islamic art.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The museum is huge with various historical displays through time and location around the Asia countries. The fee is less than $10 per ticket. For private students like me, it just takes $4."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazing highly detailed museum! Great displays of artifacts and exhibits with meticulous descriptions. expect to spend quiet a bit of time here. definitely worth a visit.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The museum was full with art & history items, and how art is related to religion as well. It features different exhibitions from time to time. I visited the place in late Jan, just in time to catch the i-light show by the Singapore river, and the i-light show at the front of the ACM building, as well as the Victoria theatre.
Overall a great experience!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Most of the exhibits are free and there's a lot of great exhibits.  Will be back
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Used to house govt  offices (NRIC and Immigration, I think - can't remember which).  Now it has been renovated in current form to house / exhibit as a Museum - modern art installation and historic relics.

It's free entrance for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This is the best museum to learn history of religions and believes in Asia. The history is very rich and deep. Guo Pei exhibition was fantastic.
I would come back again to this museum when I visit Singapore next time."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Visited the Asian Civilisations Museum during the Guo Pei exhibition and it was a joy as always.

The pieces are even more amazing in real life, and they even have the iconic “Rihanna” dress from the MET Gala on-view. We’re lucky as there was a guided tour going on during our visit and we get to learn a lot more bout some pieces from the curator Jackie.

Greatly recommend this museum to both local and overseas visitors. They always have rotating exhibition and their permanent collection galleries are equally amazing."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Relatively small but fascinating museum. Tons of history involving the Middle East and Asia trading through Singapore so a lot of cool things to see and each room talks about a general topic as well as multiple cultures that it relates to that interacted with Singapore
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,An interesting museum. The display of the Tang wreck artifacts dating from the 7th century is fascinating.

Comes with great historic antique and they are being well explained in a decent manner. The building is huge despite it outlook.

I spent 2 hours plus but could do more if not with family. Recommend for tourists. It just 5 minutes walk from Fullerton Hotel too."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I went to the Asian Civilizations Museum in December with a friend impromptu during a rainy day, the museum was filled with great artefacts and artworks. The guide provided by the museum was great and all but I would wonder if the facts that they provide are legitimate and how true, accurate they are."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I was late... Last issuance of the visitor stickers is at 6:30 pm.

Check out the surroundings whilst you are there"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Went on a weekday recently and greatly enjoyed the Tang Shipwreck exhibition. I enjoyed reading the ACM staff’s reflections on other pieces at the exhibition too.

There are two cafes at the museum for you to spend a lovely lunch/dinner before or after your visit.

Note entry to the museum is free for Singaporeans and Singapore PRs. Remember to bring ur identification!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Fascinating museum. The interior is gorgeous and the exhibits are very interesting and well presented.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazing museum! Worth the S$20. Guo Pei exhibition until Sep 15 was astonishingly beautiful.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I got a surprisingly  rich experience from visiting this  museum that gave me a lot of historical insights into how people lived a thousand years ago. Heaps of interesting porcelains from different eras and civilisations in Asia. Would recommend to history geeks!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Here for Guo Pei Exhibition but was so impressed with the permanent collection too!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great collection of Asian religious and cultural objects.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Loved the Raffles exhibit!  Loads to soak in and enjoy.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The Asian Civilizations Museum is meant to showcase the rich art and culture of not only Singapore, but also the SE Asian region. The building itself is lovely and has a strong presence, even though tranquil. The Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is an exhibit for the cargo recovered from the Tang Shipwreck, a sunken 9th century trading ship and gives an excellent overview of porcelain and other ceramics. Upstairs galleries house religious statues and idols of worship. This place is easily accessible from Raffles Place and City Hall MRT Stations. The permanent galleries are free for citizens and permanent residents. I would recommend a minimum of two hours here! A cafe and toilet facilities can be found here."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Love this Museum. It's small, but really interesting and there are lots of exhibits to see. Right in front of the museum is a lovely grassy area to have a picnic or chill."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Worth visiting to know about ASEAN, China and Indian civilization. Well maintained and informative."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Always beautifully curated and well thought out and explained.

Glad to see improvements and additions each time I visit. Something new to learn each visit."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Beautiful museum with a good collection of Asian artefacts. Went specifically for the Guo Pei special exhibition because I’ve been to the museum many times. Entrance to the exhibition cost 12SGD for Singaporean and PR. 20SGD for tourists and FREE for students & senior citizens. Museum is a short 10mins walk from Clarke Quay MRT or Raffles Place MRT.

The Guo Pei collection is a must-see even when you’ve seen the catwalks or videos of these pieces in the media. I’ve seen the omelette gown Rihanna worn on the news but it’s nothing compared to being in the physical presence of these stunning haute couture pieces which are mind blowing in their workmanship and creativity. At the exhibition you can slowly take your time to marvel at the details and texture of these exquisite pieces made with 5000-50000 human labour.

These pieces are milestones for asians in the fashion industry dominated by the European power houses. Through this exhibition I gained a strong sense of respect for Guo Pei with her team of more than 500 artisans who are bringing back traditional styles like embroidery and beading in a world where it’s dying out.

I was lucky enough to attend a tour by a wonderful guide who was able to share lots of interesting details about Guo Pei’s creations."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of the unexpected treasures in Singapore for sure. You can easily spend a good two hours walking through and sitting and contemplating their beautifully presented and curated exhibitions and come to a much better understanding of the many facets of Asian civilisations, its peoples and their style and history.. Very recommended for residents of Singapore and visitors, knowledgeable and neophyte alike."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nicely and tastefully displayed collection with ample descriptions.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Talks about the shipwreck and religions of China, Indonesia and more"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This is likely public park, with several kind of huge mirror balls at the yard. I preferably enjoying my lazy sunday afternoon here, just to chillax in front of singaporr river side. And grab some snacks. ;)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Fantastic Museum, and great free tours. Student discount for international students also available"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Unbelievably rich and very well presented collection. Definetely worth visiting.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This place is another one of those hidden gems of Singapore. It houses ancient sculptures and statues from the entire south-east Asian region, and China and India, and is a museum in a more traditional sense, quite different from the National Museum. The highlight of the display is of course the remains from the Tang shipwreck, recovered through underwater archaeology. The stash had an insane number of ceramic bowls being exported from China, which have survived almost unscathed, and are now displayed in a unique fashion. Also, check out the different Buddha statues from the region. From 8 April to 22 July, a special exhibit on Angkor Wat is going on, check out that as well. The best time to visit is on Friday evenings; the museum is open till extended hours (9 pm, instead of the usual 7 pm closure) and tickets are half-priced."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Worth spending a couple of hours to follow the detailed explanations of the different exhibitions. Admission is cheaper on Friday evenings for tourists between 7pm and 9pm ($10).
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Not too overwhelming...90 minutes could be enough...I note the shift in narrative to explain that Singapore was a thriving port before the Brits arrived!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Beautiful museum. Included in the ticket price, you may benefit from guided tours, which give you a better understanding of the exhibited masterpieces"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of the easiest museums to access, it’s very enjoyable and offers a broad look at the history and treasures of Asia."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Fascinating display of artifacts from around Asia. Good to see that some of the displays have changed since I last came here a few years ago.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Awesome collection of Asian topics. it's Free for Singaporeans. Simply scan your ID and get a sticker.

My favorite is the Tang Shipwreck. It's really a significant find. YouTube it before you go. You'll thank me."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great EXPERIENCE. Went for the Cambodian Angkor Wat Gallery. The other collections were also amazing .
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Awesome place to learn about the rich tapestry of Asian history in Singapore.  Some of the ways artifacts are displayed are truly artistic.  However the highlight is the tours.  Scholarly but enjoyable.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Civilization of Asia all in one place..
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,nice place to venture and see all different cultural ancient antique.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Loved the Guo Pei exhibition, can't get enough of it. Brilliantly curated, very cohesive and quite well integrated. You can definitely see which pieces in the museum inspired Guo Pei's bridal gown creations."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Very interesting museum with lots of exhibits. It's very well laid out and presents content in an interesting and engaging way.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"The museum was full of interesting Asian artifacts. It is a great place to absorb and learn more about Asian, especially Chinese culture. A collection like this is hard to find in any western museums."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Me and my friends were honestly not ready for the Guo Pei exhibit at the museum. This isn't to down play the other items in the museum as I really enjoyed them, their level of detail, the coverage the museum had and the food options on site. But that Guo Pei exhibit just blew us away."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I love this museum. However today is the first time I had ever attended the lunch time concert
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Such an extraordinary and unique collection of Asian history. The shipwreck display is mesmerising.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,portraits the many influences modelling Singaporean culture through centuries.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the best museums in Asia.  My family enjoyed the visit very much!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"As a decorative arts museum, the ACM appeals to a wider audience. Who am I to yearn for an earlier ACM which created a neutral space where comparative Asian religious could be discussed  and new appreciations encouraged among visitors."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A great place to spend a couple of hours and learn more about the history of Singapore and Asia more broadly. The perfect sized museum and not overwhelming. The Guo Pei exhibition was stunning!!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I would say a must go! It really very interesting and historical to learn about the history of china .
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is devoted to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. The museum traces its roots to the Raffles Museum, founded in the middle of the 19th century. ACM focuses on the many historical connections between the cultures of Asia, and between Asia and the world. Singapore’s history as a port city that brought people together from all over the world is used as a means of examining the history of Asia. Special exhibitions bring magnificent objects from around the world to our Singapore audience. Programmes like the annual River Nights encourage visitors to connect more closely with culture and the arts."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Friendly staff and plenty of security officers stationed within the galleries.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great Muzium with great staffs. Admission to the main gallery is free to all Singaporean and PR. Must come.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,There are seats at the public area to take a rest even if you didn’t buy a ticket to visit the restricted area

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Lots of treasures inside this museum. I saw an intricate belt with 75 carats of diamonds!!! Gasp...
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I love museums which give you a good local connection and that is exactly what the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore tries to do with artefacts from across south east Asia.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,If you are a museum fan you can explore it. We had fun outside even outside the museum
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The Asian civilisation museum displays artefacts of early Singapore history . Interesting for those keen to know in depth of the early settlements as far back to Ancient Ming Dynasty , the temengong era etc. Just oustide this museum is Singapore river ."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Went for the Angkor Exhibition. The tour guide was really knowledgeable and was an interesting visit!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Visiting here... this verry nice place..near singapore river... if u in here enjoying free wifi

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great little museum in what used to be the Passport Office. Beautiful and fascinating artifacts from the neighbouring countries, and there are even some fragments excavated in Singapore."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Good place to spend a couple of hours, mostly about the ship wrecks I and around Singapore."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Excellently curated exhibition. I can spend the entire day there. The downside is that it does not lend itself for a family with young kids as the exhibits may not appeal to them. Definitely a must-go for teenagers to adults who have interest in history. Free for Singaporeans and PR
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,You can learn a lot of the Asian Clivisations in this museum! I'll show you some photos!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Filled with carefully curated artefacts from around the world and especially south east Asia, family friendly and suitable for people all of ages. Definitely recommended!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Amazing display of crockery, had a shipwreck exhibition from 830A.D. of china and gold + several galleries of porcelain that had been traded in the region, with many items made in China etc. but for sale to Arab, European, Dutch Indonesia etc.
Religious items displays also wonderful"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"It's a landmark of Singapore, highly recommended if you're a friend of museum. Unlike other popular museums in Singapore, the ticket fee is only 8 Singaporean dollars. You can put things in a locker for fee and the deposit is 50 cents. Should be big enough to put your backpacks.

You can see the artefacts recently discovered from a Tang-dynasty or AD830 sunken shipwreck, most of which may not be highly valuable but it vividly shows the livelihood and the frequent and large commercial tradings between China and the Arabic world. There are other themes in the museum as well, artefacts used for trading, Chinese porcelain, Southeast Asian indigenous religious stuffs... Some of the oldest artefacts shown are from Han dynasty more than two thousand years ago.

I spent two and a half hours there. It's an enriching experience. I'd say it's more worthwhile to visit than the other pricier museums in Singapore!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,2,ACM may need to consider including interactive displays to engage younger patrons.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great location and a super museum! Look forward to visiting again next time in Singapore!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Interesting museum with a nice collection of asian artefact related to trades practiced by various countries in Asia Middle East and Europe.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The ACM is a favourite of mine. A lovely small museum that won't leave you overwhelmed. Since I'm a history buff of Korean and Japanese culture/history, decided to pop over to the ACM for Joseon Korea exhibition. Absolutely brilliant stuff. Wish they could have brought in more artifacts"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"If you are finding a place to be chilling, this place is super cozy and nice place to know. Along the canal, there is a space that you can sit on, not too hot because it's breezy and a lot of trees around. Nice moment for tourists who want to see how local people do in their weekend, joking, chatting, etc. Ahhh, there is mobile icecream parlour."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Confusing walkways, but pleasant place to just enjoy history and nice ventilation. They have nice restaurant/cafe."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,My first museum visit in Singapore. ACM has a nice collection divided over 3 levels. On the first level the Tang shipwreck inpressed me the most. On the second floor the ACM momentairly has the Angkor exhibition. Very impressive a must see. I would surely recomend the ACM to anyone.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,It's a nice building with quite handful number of artefacts collection from all over the Asian continent. If you're lucky you might be able to join the tour which lasted for about an hour. While it's not really a big building I'd say about 1.5-2 hours visit should do it..
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Absolutely amazing!!Highly recommended 😍👌
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,They had great exibits going on when i was there. Right behind Fullerton Hotel.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Amazing museum, very quiet during Light to Night 2018. The exhibited artifacts are beautiful but the maps, directions, and navigation left much to be desired."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Good place to visit and chill. Recently there is a Angkor exhibition. Every now and then, there will be changes to the exhibition in Asian Civilisation Museum."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Staff is pathetic, rest is good"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Looks small but there are so many artefacts or kids shows or special exhibitions inside. Love the organised theme for each display. Worth to go to. And it's near to the central district of Singapore for people to explore the MBS, Merlion, Esplanade etc."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Free for sporeans. Nice place
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"They have some interesting exhibits - especially the ground floor exhibit about an early trading ship that sunk close to Singapore - but overall it doesn’t live up to its name because it’s quite small and provides too little context. With a good guide who focuses on details, it would probably be a better experience. Excellent museum cafe though."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very in depth coverage of Asian civilisations. Definitely worth many visits to learn about the rich history and culture
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Well presented and minimalistic. A good balance of ancient and (some) modern artworks.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice quiet place to learn about the asian trade routes and how they shaped the region.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Insightful and interesting exhibitions about Asian history, not too crowded even during weekends."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"The Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is an institution which forms a part of the four museums in Singapore, the other three being the Peranakan Museum at Old Tao Nan School, the National Museum of Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum.

It is one of the pioneering museums in the region to specialise in pan-Asian cultures and civilisations. The museum specialises in the material history of China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia, from which the diverse ethnic groups of Singapore trace their ancestry.

History
The museum first opened at the Old Tao Nan School building on 22 April 1997 at Armenian Street, with exhibits largely centred on Chinese civilisation. With the restoration of the Empress Place Building, the museum established its new flagship museum there on 2 March 2003, rapidly expanding the collection to other areas of Asia. The Armenian Street branch closed for renovations on 1 January 2006 and reopened on 25 April 2008 as the Peranakan Museum, specialising in Peranakan culture."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,We good to go on the field for a cm
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Definitely recommend to take the scheduled tours with the guide
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,2,"Nice museum, liked the part about the different religions, polite and helpful staff.
However, disappointed about the fact that EP holders, living many years in Singapore, paying taxes - are treated like all tourists and have to pay the full entrance fee - but PR's don't have to pay.
Furthermore the whole 3rd floor is closed for a longer time due to renovations (and you could hear the noises) - but the ticket price is still the same to visit the rest of the museum.
The only positive point regarding ticket price - I could get at least 10% as Krisflyer Cardholder."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great museum, with some very interesting exhibitions about Asia. It's very conveniently located by the river, so pretty easy to find and get to. I would highly recommend their exhibition on the Tang Shipwreck. It is well curated and very informative. Each exhibition also has a paper booklet you can read for more information. I would highly recommend."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Great museum about the history, art, and artifacts of old Asia. Located by the picturesque Singapore river, getting there is a short walk from Raffles Place MRT station. There is a big and interesting exhibition of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Admission is free for Singaporeans and $8 for tourists(adults)on Friday nights, 7-9pm."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great place with knowledgeable informations on religious and culture especially in Asia!!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,I go there because my nephew's wedding dinner at empress restaurant food nice is only walking distance ten min from Raffles mrt  restaurant just next to asian civilization museum

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Excellent exhibits and wonderful tour guides. A fantastic place to spend a whole day learning about Asian culture.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Empress restaurant has delicious food, nice scenary along the Singapore River."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,1,"The security staff ruined our experience. They kept telling at people, no touching, no sitting on bench, etc. in the rude manner."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Enjoyed the trip and learnt a lot.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A must go place in Singapore
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great place with interesting displays and seating areas if you ever get tired. You can almost spend half a day here without even trying as the museum is quite expansive!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Cozy place for family
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"In my opinion it is nowhere near as good as the 5 star rating suggests. Most of the content is porcelain and earthenware, few interesting things as furniture or clothes or jewelry or weapons. The exhibitions themselves are kind of interesting but barely have a connecting theme which is trade. Some facts are repeated so if you start reading another wall of text you might get annoyed to find another three sentences that say that there was a lot of trade with China. A major annoyance is that names and descriptions of the exhibits are not placed individually in front of the exhibit but are on a separate sign (see picture). If for example you are interested in one of the twelve exhibits in a glass cube, you have to skim over all the description trying to figure out which belongs to which. This gets tiring very quickly and I didn't bother trying to understand what I was looking at after a while. The rooms themselves are nice and spacious. It's cheap so if you are close by and interested in earthenware and porcelain check it out, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,We've enjoyed many exhibitions at the ACM. Recommend checking online for details and any deals. Gorgeous building to enjoy too. Usually we eat at Prive cafe there as well. Then walk aloong the tiver outside.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice museum with many regions' historical artifacts
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The experience has been positive and enjoyed the different exhibition along the years.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,I liked it because of the wonderful dresses. Lots of artefacts hear. Goupei is a great Designer i loved her dresses!!!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"If you like history, this is a museum you can find out about ancient cultures, art and civilisation."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Inside should be good but I would like to say the building from outside view at night is very good. I often see the person who has good camera takes pictures there.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great exhibit on Joseon Korea when we visited
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Inspiring space. Bonus: incredible view of Marina Bay Sands
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Nice place to know our South East Asia culture. Sgporean and PR no need to pay for entrance fees, please take note"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,The top floors are very beautifully set out (believe it's been recently renovated). There's a lot of pottery throughout the museum which isn't the most exciting...
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"This museum is quite complete to visit to understand asian and mostly singapore culture. It has a great collection of asian religion (budhist, moslem, and hinduism) and great collection of chinesse pottery works. The collection was not complete since it was being renovated the time i was there.
It is really helpful with the free guide tour from the museum for 1 hour."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Good place to discover more about ancient asia history
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Was there for Angkor exhibition. Nice setup and preview. For better experience, visit the Angkor site itself."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,It's very well curated.  I particularly enjoyed the video art on their exhibition on trade products.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the most impressive museum I have ever seen
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Historical presentation about early Singapore & how its strategic location affected trade, religious influences."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Lovely museum to learn, relearn and remind us of Asian histories and progress. It seems to be a underutilized venue for the locals.  Always a pleasure to be in a tranquil space like this.
A place for the curious, young and old regardless of age.
- Hope there are more directions to guide new visitors on the various exhibitions."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Beautiful museum, very interesting."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Public spaces are free. Check out the free public space upstairs for a free virtual exploration of the area and decorate your own Chinese scroll to bring home.  For the museum, it contain religious statues and old porcelain bowls etc if you can appreciate."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazing place! Rich with culture and history.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Good for killing 4-5 hrs.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Nice display with periodic change of exhibitions. Was quite surprised that some of the artifacts are not kept behind glass casings. Eg,  the stone figurines. Unknowing spent more than 2 hours here. Highly recommended if you love history."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Interesting place with good cafe
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Visited ACM today after so many years. I am still amazed by the rich exhibits it has. As much as I can I will find time to visit Singapore museums in the future.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,1,The lack of guided tours is ridiculous
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Fantastic!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"If you like Chinese, south east asian and Indian cultural and historical artifacts, this is thr place to go. Especially worth visiting for the 9th century ship wreck artifacts recovered from sea bottom and for the gold and diamond jewellery collection. Also do visit the Prive cafe which is on premise and serves amazing food"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Lot of statues around, interesting poses n history abound. Take yr time and you will spot the Singapore Cat perching at the edge of the river. It's challenging and that's what make the walk so interesting. The place is clean and happening. Go, enjoy！"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A cosy place with good exhibits
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Helped me learn more about how trade flowed and affected how we live today
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Checkout the Tang Treasure collection! Rare porcelains and Tang treasures over 1200 thousand years old!  Interesting collection of Asian artifacts which shows the melange of cultures/ faiths and how these influence art.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Guo Pei special exhibit
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"It is a good place to hop in for a visit to check out some interesting artefacts houses there, while taking some shade from Singapore’s sweltering weather. There are both permanent and changing exhibitions, so be sure to keep a look out for what is in season. Fees are usually charged for admissions into temporary exhibitions. All in all, it is worth visiting when in the city :)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Most impressed by the shipwreck exhibition right at the entrance. Fascinating to see porcelain craftmanship so early
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great place to spend some time.   Beautiful exhibits showing the history of (mostly) Southeast Asia, with artifacts ranging from modern to thousands of years old.  The price is incredibly affordable (8sgd) for foreigners when I went and worth every penny.  It's also less crowded than other museums in the area."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Calm colonial buildings clusters where you can read Singapore's history and enjoy a relaxing stroll
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,So peaceful inside and great café by the waterside
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Best place for take a nap. Really quite and make your day beeing sleepy

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A must-visit museum for those keen on learning history of civilizations of Asia - trading, religions, famous scholars, you name it!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,History...... India.... God....goddesss
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Went for the Raffles in Southeast Asia exhibition and am quite impressed with the exhibits and accompanying activities.  I will be back as it is quite impossible to see everything in one evening.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Must see
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The smaller museum in SG. The exhibits will keep you occupied for about.... 2 hours.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Amazing display . Attended a show which was very informative. One can do if time permits.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Guided tour was educational.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Beautifully curated displays
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Awesome. The staffs friendly and efficient!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Located near Raffles Place MRT Station, this museum is easily accessible by public transport.

The permanent galleries is free for citizens and permanent residents. Some of the more interesting exhibits are on the different idols from different religions. These idols showcase the evolution due to influences from other cultures through the ages."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,There are plenty of museums in Singapore and Asian Civilisations Museum is one among them to be visited.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"They have exhibits as old as 5,000 years. A rare chance to see such old artifacts."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"As a 1.5 generation mixed ethnicity Singaporean - American, I found the subtle Singaporean ties educational. The unselfconscious contextualizing of multiple Asian historical contexts was incredibly valuable. If you travel as an Asian American, you will never forgive yourself if you miss this chance to center Asian history and culture."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"After National Museum I hope for something more, but it is nice place to visit and learn more about history of Asia."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Excellent collection of Asian art, with commentary on how it relates to the history of Singapore and the region."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Food not bad, especially the dessert"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Food and ambience is great, staff is horrible"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,By far the best museum in Singapore.... expect to spend ~2h here.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice history free for Singaporeans and affordable for tourists
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice museum with free entry for Singaporean. It's clean and nice. Will come back here again
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A place where history is revealed. Very enjoyable time inside it.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Wonderful museum!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"ACM is my favourite museum in Singapore. Like all other museum, walking around is not good enough. Be sure to catch the free guided tour in the afternoon."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A broad collection on South East Asia.  History for the people in Singapore whose ancestors came from the region.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Was fascinated by the collection displayed and exhibited on this museum, really reflects some of our asian roots and history."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"It is free for Singaporean, so happy"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Good collection of pottery and well situated along the Singapore River, which means you can stroll along the banks after your museum visit."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Good museum. Discount for students.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"They've renovated the place since I last came! It looks much more up to date now on the inside. It was a little confusing to navigate the space, though that is a result of trying to make the most of the gallery space. My wife and I didn't manage to finish the special galleries in one visit (about an hour?). Not my favourite museum, but still a good one that's worth a visit."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"I found the lack of descriptions disturbing...  A lot of the displayed items were very unique but labeled such as: ""Object X was used during the xyz period for rituals"". As a genuinely curious person I want to discover more. Such as the ritual, the meaning of engravings and paintings or insights about techniques  used to create an object. Background information which in comparison the National Museum of Singapore never fails to deliver."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Lots of place to take pictures
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Quiet enough for my kids and I to roam around.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice event this my 2nd year when down.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The normal museum exhibits are interesting but the 'living with ink' exhibition (closes March 2020) was fascinating.  I hadn't realised how many famous Chinese artists had worked in Singapore.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Asian civilisations museum.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Absolutely remarquable museum. Must go !
Take the guided tour with Jupiter at 4:30pm on Saturdays, it's a great experience.
Highly recommended."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I really enjoyed the exhibit of all the treasure that was found from the sunken ship. It was well presented and the cargo was in great shape. The rest of the museum gives good coverage across many aspects of Asian civilization, but the problem is there's so much more Asian civilization that could have been represented. Eve n so, I enjoyed the three levels of artifacts that they do have."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I think it's one of the better museums in Singapore. Be sure to join one of their guided tours headed by their museum volunteer.
Some of the museum pieces on display are quite cool especially the Tang Shipwreck."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"It costs 20 sgd and they didnt give me the teacher discount unlike the national gallery. And the guard asked me about my payment sticker as if i needed to pay a separate ticket for the angkor exhibit. Not cool.

The highlight was the tang dynasty haul that i had seen on some talks about the maritime silk route. The descriptions dont focus on that as much as the interconnecting trade routes and connections that made singapore what it is as a colonial jewel in the british empire. It was cool to see the gold and silver artifacts although only a handful out of the 70,000 pieces were precious metals. Most are ceremics. It shows the connection between iran and the middle east and the wares made in the kilns scattered in china.

The angkor visiting exhibit from france had some well preserved statutes and side panels that was taken from siem reap during the colonial era of france.

The rest of the exhibit was mostly religious sculpture from buddhist and hindu temples from across east and south east asia. The museum has some very intact pieces, much better than the ones i have seen in california and chicago and new york."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Want to know more about Asian History in quicker way, Come ACM."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice museum
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Historical exhibition of shipwreck and religious artifacts
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,Visited the restaurant there.  Nice food
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A rich museum and helpful staff. Families should try to visit on their family Friday events. There are a lot of hands on activities to help build curiosity and interest around history.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Beautiful place
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"It's free for me,  no reason not to be 5 stars"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Really enjoyed it!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very cool museum.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"With a visit, go on one of the free days."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Was nearby and some time so decided to drop by when they were having the Guo Pei Chinese Couture special exhibition. However I found the galleries on Ancient Religion in South East Asia especially illuminating. I overheads a museum guide share some insights. Its good to have a guide and if time permits go another round to read the descriptions.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Insightful museum which gives you a wonderful overview of Southeast Asian history. Exceptionally well-curated, it will leave you itching to know more."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Simply stunning. We really loved the exhibition with the sunken treasure, and I found the religious art fascinating! Absolutely worth a visit."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A place to visit If you would like to know about the culture~ Singaporean can visit the standard gallery for free!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I enjoyed this museum. I particularly liked the gallery on religion as it's quite well explained and in depth. Lots of interesting artefacts to look at.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"got mirror ball here. you can take photos, chill & eat $1 icecream around here"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great tour with the guide. So fascinating to hear the history from the local guide and see all these amazing artefacts
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Displays are organised, well kept & well displayed."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Fascinating exhibition of cargo recovered from a shipwreck of a Tang Dynasty trading vessel.  Kid friendly work in the contemporary room, and our children were able to create small works and add them to the ""collective"" piece.  The headline was the Guo Pei exhibition which was nice but not as impressive for me as the Tang shipwreck on Level 1.  A bit overpriced for a family with small children."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Nice display. Paid entrance fee SGD20, for overseas visitor. Expect to spend more than 1 hour there. Professionally done. Worth the money.  Thank you"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Beautiful museum with interesting artefacts.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Must visit!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Magnificent exposition of the Asian culture
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Brief civilisation histories of artifacts, antiques, religious cultures, tribal cultures, literature, etc. Simple introduction and  explanation for visitors that traces most of the part in South East Asia with some touch on East and South Asia. Nonetheless, the museum serves both the purpose of cross cultural and inter-religious introduction that may boost mutual understanding across multi races with different beliefs."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I enjoyed my visit here, a good place to stop to appreciate some of Asia's history. I will say that the museum is small when considering the enormous wealth of Asia's history. I recommend a quick visit here, though it could be larger."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"I was expecting way more... If you also go to the Singapore National Museum I think you can skip that one. Way less interactive, smaller and kind of reapting itself"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,He had lots of fun with the family. We loved the children activity - Mr Dragon's great escape.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the Museums in Singapore to visit. Has a wide range out South East Asian Artifacts. Surprised to see Myanmar kingdom pieces here rather than in Myanmar. They are probably on long term loan. The latest exhibit was for Guo Pei! Loved the collection 😍😍😍😍
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Love the Ancient Religion, Islamic Art & Christian Art Exhibits. In today’s diverse world, it’s good to get unbiased & real information on the different religions and it’s history. Would recommend parents to bring their kids whether you are a believer or not. Can’t think of a reason why any Singaporeans should miss this as all admissions to the exhibits are free."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"A great experience! Get to know more ancient artifacts and if you're a citizens it's free entry so why not give it a go. Side note, if you don't like crowds, then visit in the evening."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,my wife says 5
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,A great experience. So much to see and explore I spent 3 hrs here so the $20 entry was worth it. The museum is well organised and easy to navigate.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Awesome
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Fascinating museum with some awesome exhibits. Wish we'd had more time to explore it. Well worth a visit
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Possibly the most interesting museum in Singapore
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Rich artistic heritage of Asia
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great museum to visit.  Exhibits are well thought out. I've been to many museums in the world and im proud to say ours are pretty top notch. Not very crowded during weekday lunch hours.  Highly recommend.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Enjoyable museum! Best in Singapore by far in terms of curation and experience. National Gallery’s adaptive reuse left a lot of unusable exhibition space in the museum, but this museum made none of the same mistakes"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Problematic Raffles exhibition but good permanent collection . See the Tang dynasty one!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,It is the most amazing place to visit we learnt so much. Be prepared to spend minimum of 3 hrs.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Great, just great. Took us a whole day.
Cafeteria inside is a little bit expensive.
There is a part complementary art, perfect for kids. Doing something and participating in something bigger."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazingly designed place to learn the history of Singapore good visuals and presentation; centrally located around cbd
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,A reasonable place to visit.  Nowhere close to an out of the world experience.. But it has enough to spend a couple of hours.  Ambience is good. Asian civilization show case pretty decent.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Great learning of various cultures.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Fun and interactive place
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great museum... the shipwreck exhibit is amazing; the depth and breadth of material there gave a comprehensive look at that time period
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Awesome artifacts
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"This is a superb exhibit of arts and craft, especially because it provides fascinating political, historical, cultural context to each of the 16 or so galleries, which are arranged in chronological order. Very well done"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Hands down one of the best museums anywhere. Have been many times over the years as I travel through Singapore. Fantastic collections and impeccable display in very comfortable surrounds. Highly recommend!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A lot to learn from South East Asian history and the connections with our current times. The exhibitions also changes frequently so always comeback to this place. The museum shop Museum Label is a must visit for souvenir shopping too
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place that shows the Asian heritage trail
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"We got a bit disoriented because we didn't take the tour - but it was quite fascinating to learn about the incredible history of the region and the cultures that inspired it! Be prepared that there might be some lines for special exhibits, especially on weekends!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The history of Asia.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"It was great!!! Expect level 2 it to scary w the lighting, ps dont go alone it will scared the f out of u🤣 speaking from experience"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A museum that plays to the strengths of Singapore's historical location in the crossroads of Asian maritime trade. Well laid out, informative, really worth a repeat visit! You can learn more than you think possible about topics from the ceramics trade and cultural exchange to local SE Asian cultures and the spread of religions there"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,This is very unique themed museum; able to understand history of Asian countries especially in ancient period of time. The building itself is colonial style building and you can enjoy exploring inside of this museum. Restaurant and cafe inside of this museum is very stylish and best for night chilling or weekend brunch.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I like to pop into this museum every few years. Sometimes I see something that I have seen before but in a new light.
This time it was to see a special exhibition by Guo Pei, a designer who has dressed some famous celebrities.
It was interesting because it featured her designs and the historical influences that inspired her.
A historical artefact was exhibited near the dress with an explanation of it's origins, historical context, and her interpretation of it in her work.
Thus was a novel idea and I think it worked well."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Went there with a friend primarily for the Living with Ink exhibition, planned to spend half a day there but man, were we so wrong about how much time we'd take. We spent a bit of time at the Tang shipwreck exhibition, and it was so engrossing! (Prob coz of the good company - we paused very often, looked at the exhibits and exchange comments; if you go with someone who just walks past the exhibits then it'll take a lot less time, I can guarantee).
For Living with Ink, join a guided tour (45min-1hour), it's so informative you'll suddenly feel there's so much more to look out when looking at the painting. Kudos for the hands-on activities where you can (lazily) make calligraphy-like pictures (the kids love it, I can tell). They also have performance and it's very kid/family-friendly.
We didn't have enough time to visit all other permanent exhibitions due to gross underestimate of time needed, only briefly through the Scholars one and some time in the Religions one. But they turned out to be equally good too! What a pity.
Advice for those with good company and generally like visiting museum: maximize your entrance fee by spending the whole day there. Recommend having lunch at Prive, very nice deco, good food and affordable too. Purchasing of museum tickets entitles you to 10% food there iirc."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Interesting new guest exhibition. Café and bar outside offers scenic happy hour drinks in a relaxed location.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"It's the official museam of Singapore that is describing the history about the city including an overview about the broader political and society situation in Asia in the past. In my opinion it was a bit too focused on the old days and not mentioned enough about the recent achievements. If you want to get a complete pic about Singapore visit it, but if you go there it's not a problem either"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"We came specifically for the Guo Pei exhibition. Her dresses are amazing and to be able to see them up close was wonderful. The intricate beadwork and embroidery was truly beautiful. The small exhibition was well curated, explaining the design and what influenced her creations. Well worth coming to see it."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"It is one of my favourite places to visit in Singapore as it is well curated with an extensive collection of artefacts of the region. In terms of story-telling, the National Museum of Singapore does it better...

Nonetheless, still a must visit place here!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Guo Pei special exhibition is very fresh and special.
dress should be shown in 360 degrees so everyone can admire it in every angle.
overall, it is special exhibition"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Generally rude, unfriendly and inefficient service at the front desk. Good exhibitions"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Small, compact museum. Very informative and its collection boasts the only Tang Dynasty wreck in the world. Shows the existence of a thriving maritime trade in Southeast Asia and its importance as a maritime hub for the last 1000 years."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Cool place adjacent to river. Great set up with option of sitting indoor & outdoor. Though limited vegeterian options.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,1,Soso. Nothing special
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great museum. Tang wreck display incredible
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,3 levels of different exhibition
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Lots to learn in a well done museum. Give it two hours minimum and you are sure to learn some new history.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,2,Not really a museum to bring kids to. exhibits are more for adults looking to immense themselves to understand the Asian culture and religions
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Lots of cultural exhibits for you to see.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place to walk quietly and know more about our history.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great place for the family with activities for the young. Very educational too!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,It's a museum that looks small. It's insanely big on the inside. Spotlights are smartly placed at the ceiling pointing at various artifacts.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A favourite place to visit. Went to see the Angkor exhibition and we had a great dossier who explained things quite well. After the visit you can hang out at they cool cafe by the Singapore river
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Absolutely awesome!! The curators know how to make every exhibit interesting, educational and entertaining for school kids and adults alike! I saw a fantastic exhibit about a shipwreck found off the Singapore coast full of plates, destined for Europe."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Nice building. However,  I was there to take photos of Raffles white statue but contractors are working on the white statue to change it to a gray checked design. It was half done, changed to a checked design to match the windows of a nearby building so that when you look at the Raffles statue with the office building directly behind it, it disappears, as it is the same colour and design as the office building behind it. Why are the authorities destroying a historical monument?"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,The museum has some really great exhibitions which provide visitors with a fascinating look at the history of various Asian countries.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Unbelievable exhibit. Simply one of the best curated museums on the subject in the world.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very nice museum definitely a must-do in Singapore. Could definitely spend at least half a day they are. Yes art and culture from Mall of Asia
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Well maintained museum, with a few very expensive items (Chinese porcelain for example). Good view of Angkor Wat ... A lot of Buddha statues. I would visit again and spend more time there."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A superb museum.  It showcases the major religious, cultural and historical artefacts of Asia in a systematic way.   Highly recommended for all history lovers!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A beautiful museum. Mostly full of pottery found in and around a shipwreck and some other artifacts from far between Chinese empires and the Middle East. There is another wing on religions opening in a few months. I enjoyed it, but if the aforementioned isn't your thing, this is not for you."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice place
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Nice museum which has been remade twice in 30 years.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,An excellent museum that exceeded our expectations.  Well curated with good explanations that keep your interest throughout.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"A good place to know Asia in depth. Because of it's vast collection, I think you would need more than 2 hours to really see everything. Maybe a guided tour would be best when you visit this place"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"I really enjoyed this museum. They had a special exhibition on Angkor Wat and as we were going there it was good to get a taster on what it would be like.

The layout was excellent and they had some great interactive activities where we could go stone rubbings and make little paper models of some of the temples and sculptures.

The other exhibitions were also great. I loved the exhibition on the shipwreck found near Singapore with many of its treasures still in great condition. The display on different Asian religions was very interesting and fun to look at and the ceramics section was beautiful.

You can take pictures without flash and it was decently priced. I think if you go on a Friday evening, you can get in for cheaper."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Food is nice, service crew is friendly also, definitely will revisit."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Went for the Halloween event. Absolute bomb even if it was free. Loved the storytelling in the dark, will definitely got for it's future events."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I loved it! It was very well maintained and the docents there were actually skilled volunteers who are interested in history. I had a really enjoyable time there and i managed to learn a lot
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Love the antiques and earthen wares. There was so much to see that our legs went sore from walking around but surely it would entertain you if you are one to be interested in antiques and porcelains. There were some ebony and ivory furniture on display too. As well as historic specimens that showed Singapore's past
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Weird, unintuiative layout but excellent collections. I would recommend getting a map or a guide so you don't end up in loops!"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"Ask the guards if you think you lost inside the museum, because the doors and floors are quite confusing. It is cooling inside the room but outdoor is hot. You can relax and sit at nearby cafes."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the gems in the city center.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Amazing place. Had a tour with denise and I was fascinated by the explanations of the highlights of the museum. I really enjoyed the religions exhibits as well!

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Really cool exhibits, but too many to cover. Our brains were fried by the end. They should number the artifacts for reference to the information."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I've round realy interesting, lot of Things Lernead about the history  of Asia
Thiket (s$20)is not so expensive, especialy because is a great museum"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"A classical museum with galleries on specific topics. No real storyline, each exhibit seemed a bit disconnected. Also Guybrush Threepwood would have a fit, I never seems so much porcelain in one place. Great place if you love china I suppose..."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Impressive and sophisticated museum that does more than present artifacts - they tell a coherent story which does not shy away from a complex narrative about the interrelationships that led to the development of international trade routes - including the ways in which developments on one side of the world influenced others far away and vice versa. Understated and professional.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Don't miss out on the free guided tour that take place at least twice a day.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,A lovely museum. Took a free guided tour. Lovely experience. Keep an eye out for smooth coated otters when you do the river side walk.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the best museums of Asian Art in the world! Set in a historic building on the banks of the Singapore river.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"ACM is one of the most visited museum in my list. There are a lot to see in their permanent galleries. Rotated galleries tend to bring in amazing works as well. Layout are arranged nicely so you won't get lost while going from one gallery to another. Located in Boat Quay just a few minutes across Fullerton Hotel, your feet won't stop even after you stepped out of this museum."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Other than literatures and books, this is the museum to go to if you want to learn more about Asian civilisations. A lot of displays from various countries. Depending on time available and interest, it can take more than one-half day to go through all the exhibits."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very interesting. Unexpected I really thought it may of been all writing and boring. Far from it. On different seperate exhibitions. Interesting exhibits for all ages. Good restaurant cafe. Small entry charge. Honestly sometimes one person is 100% interested and the other/s skip and weave. But honestly there is something for all. And exhibitions change aswell. We were recommended to go by Amoy Hotel thumbs up to them
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Superb Museum...
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Manicured, but otherwise not an extensive collection"

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,The area surrounding the museum is a nice place to relax and just simply hang-out
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,It's a wonderful place to learn about the Asian cultures over the centuries. I really ennjoyed the exibishions. Although it is located in the heart of the city it is not overrun with the tourist.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"While the museum itself is small, and doable in 2-3 hours, it houses a wide variety of artifacts from around Asia. I went during the Josen (Korea) exhibition, and I loved the artifacts and information on display. I am particularly interested in extant garments, and there were a few original pieces to view. There were also a few replicas, which appeared to be well done. I definitely recommend checking this museum out if you have the opportunity."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very well curated artifacts.  Special exhibitions such as Guo Pei: Chinese Art and Couture adds sparkto the experience & captivate visitors.  Worthwhile visit.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"We were treated with more excellent food paired with different sakes and champagne from Leigh Atelier throughout the night as various speakers explained the origin of each food served and how it is relevant to the exhibition. If you traced back, they all come from a particular source and cooking method."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Excellent museum, perhaps the most interesting in Singapore. Special interest presents the exhibition devoted to the various religions spread in Asia, located on the second floor of the museum.

Tip: it is possible to interrupt your museum visit and come back in to continue it, e.g., after having a lunch break. The museum also has its own restaurant and café, with interesting deals during happy hour."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"EMPRESS: Delicious Asian food done in an innovative way.  the atmosphere is really nice with large windows looking out into the canals(Boat Quay), and lots of natural light. If you are driving, there isn't parking at the venue -- you have to park in a building nearby (eg: National Gallery)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very interesting place to learn about trading history with Asia

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Night time there is light show till 25 Feb.

I would recommend taking one of the free tours, we took one with a French girl about the buddhism and Gandhara culture and it was very interesting."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"One of the best museums to know about the Asian civilisations. Strategically located. Complete facilities. Great ambience. International audience. Historical building architecture. Overall, very recommended."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Very well-presented with very good explanations of the various exhibitions
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,I met a volunteer guide named Swan. She is a doctor and she has this hobby for 16 years. She is so elegant and so open to the public. I admire her and I think she is an example for us.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Really well currated collection of artifacts, I especially loved the contents of the shipwreck"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great time to spend time with kids. Free for sg and pr
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"I thought it was pretty expensive for essentially being an art museum. There's tons of art for sure, but the sheer volume of pottery alone was exhausting. By the time I finished the first floor I was burnt out on ceramics and there were still 2+ floors of art to go. It was definitely worth it in terms of volume but I wish there was a greater variety or more information for context."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great place to see under the oceancovery.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Not a typical tourist place. However do visit this. When we visited there were very good exhibitions. We were highly impressed with this place.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Singaporeans and PRs can go in for free. Quite a nice and relaxing place to hang out. There's already plenty to see at the free exhibits area, but you'll need to pay to see the special exhibits

There's also a kid's area near the entrance where they can have fun."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Very informative & well presented. Kudos
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"It's ok, but I expected more regarding culture and civilisation. It's allmost only about religion and jewelery."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Visit on Fridays between 7 and 9. 50% discounts from usual pricing. If you can spend couple of hours here, worth a visit. Lots of learning."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Outstanding display of Guo Pei's masterpieces. Spent hours here. Lovely atmosphere and lots to learn.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,We could enjoy a guided tour about ancient Asian religions. There were nice works of art on Buddhism 👍
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Loved it! Spent about 3 hours here. Check out the. Guo Pei exhibit.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,I thought the first exhibit that talked about the discovery of a merchant vessel was fantastic.  The remainder of exhibits were nice but not as interesting to me.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great! Excellent friendly staff and it provided interesting insights to the history and culture of the region!!
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice restaurant ambience. Fancy fusion foods but so so tastyness
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"I was surprised to find this museum organized thematically rather than by race or culture. It takes a holistic view and approach to the Asian Civilization. As a result, it avoids the ugly comparisons and competition between modern day countries where all these cultures resides today. The main themes are: Trade, Faith and Religion, Designs and Materials.

The museum comprises of the old colonial building and a new modern wing. The flow between the old and new building is confusing to the first time visitor.

Guided tours are available. I recommend taking advantage of these tours."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"It's not free and many sections were closed during the time of my visit, many artifacts were not even labeled yet. It was a disappointing visit as I heard great things about the museum, they shouldn't have charged money while the museum is undergoing major revamp. I suggest that you asked the reception about the status of renovation before you pay to enter. Entrance is free for Singaporean and PR though"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,A museum only 5mins walk from the Raffles Place mrt. Very impressed by the way the artifacts & art were displayed. Visited for the Guo Pei exhibition and was blown away by the way the couture pieces were displayed and the way the space was lighted.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the best museum in Singapore
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Something FREE & very nice in Singapore, what else could you ask for? :) Although part of the museum was closed for restoration reason, the opened part was very nice. A guide was also provided for free."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,"If you like bowls, this place will blow your mind. Otherwise, not so much."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Good museum
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,One of the best experiences of my life
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"If you're interested in history you should go there. There's a free, very informative tour and entry is pretty cheap (8$ adults/4$ children or students)"
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Excellent collection of art, religious items, and especially pottery from all over SE Asia.
There is a specific exhibit based on a recovered merchant boat from about the 13th century.
A little bit too much of the ""we have this, so we'll display it"" mindset, so some of the pottery displayed gets repetitive, but overall very good."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place to learn
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Nice place to visit with ancient artifacts with some description.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Asian Civilizations Museum exhibiting the works of the famous Chinese fashion designer Guo Pei.
While Guo Pei is probably best known for the fabulous yellow gown worn by Rihanna, her works are flights of fantasy which took thousands of hours to create."

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Extensive collection and worth every penny
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"Really a museum that is worth visiting. It is located very conveniently, right along the Singapore river, across the Fullerton hotel. As the name suggests, this museum focuses on asian culture of the region, displaying artefacts from ancient China, India, and even kingdoms that have once thrived on the asian soil. The exhibition on each level is of a different area of focus and is usually changed yearly. If you are considering visiting a museum, I'd recommend this one."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,Antique items porcelain past history

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,Visited the ACM one hot Saturday afternoon recently. There was an exhibition of the Asian Christianity art of display. Christianity in Asia has a long history before Marco Polo. A lot of influence comes from the Indian sub-continent and also the Middle East. It seems that inter-religion acceptance back then was far more accommodating than modern times.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Brilliant we have visited 3 times now good guide and exhibition great restaurant and vegetarian nonya curry.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Truely amazing. For culture and history buffs. The guided tour greatly enhances the experience.

Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,Great gallery in the center of Singapore - not too big and not too small - perfect for an afternoon distraction.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"It is nice, but the entrance fee is too high."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,3,Lots of exhibits but could have been more interactive and digitalised.
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Never really thought to visit the ACM till I just randomly decided to go today and man was I missing out.  The quality of the exhibitits are excellent and frankly on par or better than those in london.  It is abit smaller than its european counterparts but as a relatively uncivilized individual the ACM is the perfect size for me as i tend to get bored of museums after the 2 hour mark.  Its also got a superb ambiance and its in a beautiful location in SG.  Also the current Guo Pei dress exhibit is incredible.  So considering its free except for the guo pei exhibit which only cost 12 dollars, i think everyone in SG owes it to themselves to drop by the ACM no matter expat or local as I feel its severely underepresented atm."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Have been visiting for various exhibitions since primary school, always  great experience with careful thought put into the ambience, knowledge rendered through interactive exhibits."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,4,"First museum in the region to feature cultural artefacts about the region. A good place to expose yourself to the culture and artefacts of Asia although they don't go very in depth into it.

Otherwise, I find the other museum offerings much better if you have limited time. The exhibits are mostly permanent and don't get refreshed as often."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Interesting collection, including the cargo recovered from the Tang era Arab vessel sunk in Indonesian waters."
Asian Civilisations Museum & Singapore Museum,5,"Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is one of Singapore’s most acclaimed national museums. A visit to the museum is a great way to take a journey through the interesting pan-Asian arts and culture scene. The museum provides a deep insight into the diverse Asian cultures whose integration is the rich base for Singapore’s multi-ethnic society.

The ACM was established in 1997 in the Old Tao Nan School building on Armenia Street, mainly with displays inherited from the Raffles Library and Museum. The museum later widened its collection with the opening of its flagship museum in 2003 in the restored Empress Place Building, which is a fine example of neo-Palladian architecture. In 2008, the museum’s Armenia Street branch officially opened to preserve art and artefacts exclusively from Peranakan culture."

Everytime you visit, you will definitely discover something new."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,It's a great place to escape from the bustle of the city right at the heart of the main shopping district. It is best to spend half a day to relax an unwind. Best to just come down with water and some snacks and roam around aimlessly along the many paths here.

Awesome way to spend your morning or afternoon away with your love ones."

A visit to Botanic Garden with friends."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Botanic Gardens is one of the best gardens in Singapore! It's a wonderful place to be in nature and to explore and understand the world of plants. Botanic Gardens have many different gardens along the routes such as the Evolution Garden, Healing Garden, Fragrant Garden and more! Each garden showcase a different set of plants catered specifically to the theme. You will not only gain a better understanding about the plants in each garden but also enjoy the sights and smells of each one. Do remember to bring along your insect repellent and a water bottle.

Recommended to visit at least twice because this is a huge place. Overall a very relaxing place to take a walk and be with nature!"

Ideal spot for morning walks or picnics.

It was a small pond and open fields were people were seen sitting/having a picnic.

It also has many small gardens dedicated to specific types of flora in the region.

You will find info boards everywhere explaining the flora planted nearby.

Towards the very end of the park, there is also a Centre for Ethnobotany which has brilliant hand-made tools and artifacts which were made and used by indigenous people across the South East Asia region and also the trees and plants that they used to cultivate etc.

Overall a good place for people who love exploring nature/things related to nature."

Some more interesting places such as the orchid garden which has a ticket price of $1 for Singaporeans has amazing flowers and even an air-conditioned area for more delicate orchids.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Always a good place to be when u want to close to nature. Peaceful place. Come here for jogging is a very good choice.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"This is a place full of various plants, trees and some wild animals there. To me, they are the representative from Jurong Bird Park and the Singapore Zoo. As for the durians, it is there only in ""theory"", I could not find them. Maybe it is not the season so it is difficult to identify them. Those squirrels jumping from branches to branches, monitor lizard climbing the tree, and the toucans make this day a fun one. Yes, you can get close to that lizard, he doesn't seem to be bothered."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The best garden in Singapore. Very big garden , can walk a lot many foot path and it’s has a lot of greenery"

Singapore Botanic Gardens,1,"I had a traumatising experience in the garden yesterday. I was giving a prenatal yoga class to my friend who is 28 weeks pregnant. We were 3 meters apart mask off and respecting the regulations in place. We were approached by a visitor center agent. He was aggressive and pushy. He told us to put our mask on since, according to him, this is not a high intensity activity. My friend sate that, in fact yoga in your third trimester in a high intensity activity. He demand to see my register coach permit even if it was not an organize class. But me giving a free class to my friend. It made me feel really unsafe and harassed. I hope the management will proceed to educate their agent about respect of woman."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Nice place to relax and be active. Be careful of mosquitos thought! They are everywhere, even during the day.
Other than that, there are a ton of other animals to discover and observe."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Last came here 6 years ago... so great to be back here again. Simply gorgeous and beautiful... Love it
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Came on a Friday afternoon and was absolutely serene, hardly any visitors at all and it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. Spent around 2hrs walking around at a leisurely pace and didn’t get time to see everything but at same time don’t think the aim is to tick every box in this place as it’s just a pleasant place to walk around in general.

If you’re expecting a “Kew garden” type experience then it does have aspects of this although on a smaller scale (also not any conservatories that I know of although would be less point in this climate...) will find time to come back and explore again.

Would recommend the gift shop ^_^

Conveniently placed close to and on downtown line...."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A definite gem in this cosmopolitan city.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"A lazy Sunday afternoon scroll.  Came to walk the botanic garden abit.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"What do you call the largest garden of a city of gardens and one of the three World Heritage Site garden and the only tropical one? It's big and it's beautiful. It's huge with so many things and photo ops, you need at least 2-3 hours to explore it.
Entry to garden is free but entry fees of $5 applies to Orchid garden, which is the must visit part.
If you have some spare time, walk around the garden and relax along the lake and watch children playing and running non stop.
Several gates, arches, artificial ponds and waterfall etc. We saw a huge monitor lizard crossing the way in a jiffy."

It was under construction when I was there, so I ended up walking in circle. I couldn't find a way to enter to another area of the garden. I'll go back and try again."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A wonderful place to view many types of orchid. Worth the visit even you are not a orchid lovers.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Loved it. It is in the midst of a city yet it feels as if you are miles away from any hustle and bustle. Esp the rain forest where the time has stood still. The vibes it gives you immediately transports you to another world altogether. You feel deeply connected with the nature. You feel one with the nature.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Such a great day out. We were lucky to see otters and monitor lizards as well as one of the swans gliding across Swan Lake. Huge area so you need a few hours to walk through it all. The fragrant garden smells amazing. So many interesting heritage trees. Highly recommended day out.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Great place for slow stroll around the park. But it may get crowded on Sunday.
Make sure you have umbrella for rainy days as there's isn't much shelter.
Give Yrslef more time to walk around as you may easily get lost with their confusing direction around the park"

The orchid garden is absolutely stunning and the Forest trail provides the best shade if you need a break from the blistering heat. Look out for the diverse wildlife within the gardens - monitor lizards, swans (both white and black), chickens, the occasional monkeys and even the otters have made numerous appearances over the CB period."

An amazing Orchid Garden with many different species.
A Rain Forest with nice walking path for you to stroll and view different trees and some that reach an amazing height.

Built in 1898, Atbara, at No.5 Gallop Road, is the oldest Black and White House in Singapore.

The arches reminds me of the Red Fort at Agra! I really miss India! Since I can’t travel, I just have to pretend I’m back in India.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a 162-year-old tropical garden located at the fringe of Singapore's Orchard Road shopping district. It is one of three gardens, and the only tropical garden, to be honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Botanic Gardens has been ranked Asia's top park attraction since 2013, by TripAdvisor Travellers' Choice Awards. It was declared the inaugural Garden of the Year, International Garden Tourism Awards in 2012, and received Michelin's three-star rating in 2008.[1][2]

The Botanic Gardens was founded at its present site in 1859 by an agri-horticultural society. It played a pivotal role in the region's rubber trade boom in the early twentieth century, when its first scientific director Henry Nicholas Ridley, headed research into the plant's cultivation. By perfecting the technique of rubber extraction, still in use today, and promoting its economic value to planters in the region, rubber output expanded rapidly. At its height in the 1920s, the Malayan peninsula cornered half of the global latex production.

The National Orchid Garden, within the main gardens, is at the forefront of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids, complementing the nation's status as a major exporter of cut orchids. Aided by the equatorial climate, it houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids.

Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City, an image and moniker for which the nation is widely known. In 1981, the hybrid climbing orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim, was chosen as the nation's national flower. Singapore's ""orchid diplomacy"" honours visiting head of states, dignitaries and celebrities, by naming its finest hybrids after them; these are displayed at its popular VIP Orchid Gardens.[3][4]

The Singapore Botanic Gardens is opened from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight daily. There is no admission fee, except for the National Orchid Garden. More than 10,000 species of flora are spread over its 82-hectares area, which is stretched vertically; the longest distance between the northern and southern ends is 2.5 km (1.6 mi). The Botanic Gardens receives about 4.5 million visitors annually.

History

Singapore Botanic Gardens logo, Cyrtostachys palm
The first ""Botanical and Experimental Garden"" in Singapore was established in 1822 on Government Hill at Fort Canning by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore and a keen naturalist. The Garden's main task was to evaluate for cultivation crops which were of potential economic importance including those yielding fruits, vegetables, spices and other raw materials. This first Garden closed in 1829.[5]

It was not until 30 years later that the present Singapore Botanic Gardens began in 1859, when the Singapore Agri-horticultural Society was granted 32 hectares of land in Tanglin by the colonial government, which had obtained it from the merchant Hoo Ah Kay, known as Whampoa, in exchange for land at Boat Quay.

1859–1876
The new gardens started off functioning primarily as a “pleasure park” for the society’s members. Lawrence Niven was hired as superintendent and landscape designer to turn what were essentially overgrown plantations and a tangle of virgin rainforest into a public park. He and his team worked on developing the Gardens to reflect the styles of the English Landscape Garden Movement. This included a series of “interconnecting pathways and promenades, a levelled parade area for military bands to play music... and the establishment of ornamental planting”.[6] The layout of the Gardens as it is today is largely based on Niven's design. In 1866 the Gardens expanded in the Northwest direction of about 12 hectares. There was the excavation of Swan Lake in 1866. In 1868, the Burkill Hall is completed. The Singapore Agri-horticultural Society ran out of funds, which led to the colonial government taking over the management of the gardens in 1874."

The main gate area is more interesting, which I have visited a few times. This year I tried via the Built Timah Gate and found some interesting botany too. Like all parks in Singapore, there is always wild chicken running around. There is a bamboo botany area with different types of bamboo. There is a lake called eco-lake which is small but has a pair of black swan that entertain visitors. There is also turtles and fish at the lake. We spotted lots of squirrels in this area and have a great time taking photos of them. There is birds in this area too, do look out for them. There is dragonflies and butterflies roaming around the flowers. Do visit the different gate of this gardens as they are different. So expect to spend a day just walking around the whole place and take time to enjoy the beauty of nature."

If you love orchids you must not miss it. However do take care of the heat so best to go super early to beat the sun. We went at 1:30pm and I was drenched in sweat."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Love this garden.  So big so spacious.  Very organized but not too manicured that it lost the natural feeling.  Still feels like a tropical forest at some parts with lizards moving about freely.
The orchid garden is beautiful...❤"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Well maintained botanical gardens, with many different and varied sections (natural and man-made) to encourage you to take a stroll through and discover.  There's plenty to explore with different themes for adults and children.

Nature lovers can spend the whole day here as there is seating scattered throughout, food options available, ample toilets and parts which are lively and other parts that are serene."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Nice scenery and good place to morning walk
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Want some fresh air? Or nature lover? Or get away from the city life? Head your way to Singapore Botanic Garden and enjoy yourself on a day of admiring Mother nature.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Bestest place ever in singapore !
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Serene place for a slow, quiet and reflective walk in the cool of the evening. A good place for a slow run as well. Can see some families spreading out ground sheet for a good time of bonding in the evening."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"There's about five places I would recommend to visit while in Singapore. This is one of them. The Botanic Gardens are a beautiful display of what Singapore once was and yet still has kept. From start to finish this should take you over two hours if you go through all of it. Three plus hours if you really take it all in and read the display, take photos and really appreciate the marvel they have created. This has so many varieties of plant life with almost a different Eco system only meters between. There's tons of birds and wildlife at every corner and a great place to get a run in. A well maintained jungle within a city. Everything is so well maintenanced, from the walkways to even the trees. It truly is an impressive park to visit. Free to go in but certain areas cost a couple dollars to see. But worth every penny. Great place to run, exercise, meditate, people watch or just breath in the clean air and relax."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Some of them play Pokemon Go to collect the item while walking over here. Do take note of the step. They have heard the sound and look out of the birds, squirrels, mother hen protecting the chicks and etc.

Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is a science education tour. You can bring kids to have lots of fun. There are sand and some playground to let them enjoyed, further more do exploring what they have inside and there is touch screen Map near the service counter to let the kids to explore.

Overall, there are fruits, vegetables, different flowers, animals, different people from all over the countries, having fun to gathering with friends or family to have a picnic there to relax. Some time got music at Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in the evening times or outside the National Orchid Garden, there is international student orchestra performance in the morning. Have to check their website for more update info about event and etc...  There are water cooler and toilet (Signboard to look out). U can look out for silence place and lots of shaded place to rest. They have drinks machine, even u can turn $1 coin to feed the fishes 🐠 , turtle 🐢 and etc. There are Black Swan and White Swan too... You can take a snap and come down to look for it to have fun over here. If like my normal smart phone photo do click on like. Thank you for looking through my photos."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Follow your heart in this peaceful place.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"It is large, with numerous trails.  A few small informative buildings to teach about local botany, birds, & the gardens.  Make sure you visit the learning centers.  The trees and plants are mostly local.  Some are very old.  I learned about Singapore's nature.  Informative signs everywhere.  Singapore is filled with malls seemingly on every other block, but they are redundant.  Go visit Singapore's nature in this botanical gardens.  It was 94 degrees & humid outside, but it felt fine, & I'm a San Franciscan!  The air conditioning in the 3 informational museum buildings within the gardens was a nice respite from the heat & humidity I must admit though. These gardens are beautiful & educational."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The gardens are just stunning everything is intricately placed to perfection, beautifully clean and easy to get around. Although the weather was awful when I went it did not spoil the beauty of the place. Highly recommend going to the gardens just to see the variety of orchards they have on show."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Amazing park! I was very excited to see the intact rainforest walk. Do yourself a favor and go see the orchard garden as well (small fee but worth every cent).
If you are a botany enthusiast, spend a whole day here. We only had a few hours and didn't even see half of the park."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Always a great place and more so during Covid-Times. Calms one down...
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Exceptional plant and tree diversity. The orchids were colorful, unique, and visually stunning.
We saw wild roosters and even a dragon hunting for worms.
The tree variety was immense in both size and proportions.
The paths were wide with eclectic varieties of colors to look at.
We found stunning fragrances and unique seeds, leaves, and fauna.
Sharing the time with my Singapore family created so many visual and personal loving memories
We will come back again on another day as we did not have enough time to squeeze it all in.
I paid the $5 foreigner charge was was grateful to have such a visual catalog of colors, sights, and sounds.
#RockFromRI"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,One of the best-reserved places in Singapore. It's very well maintained and one can spend hours roaming around or just relaxing. The place is vast and probably will take you more than half a day to fully explore it. I always enjoy going here for morning runs and then treating myself to a good full-filling breakfast in one of the many award-winning restaurants located inside the garden. Recommended full time 😁.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful garden at the edge of shopping district, 1st UNESCO World Heritage Site of Singapore!"

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Very nice park to walk or have a picknick!
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Excellent escape to nature,  floral and plants.  Great place to exercise."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,3,"Too many unnecessarily closed off areas, for so called social distancing?? Why not close off the mrt trains and buses, as there is no social distancing in Aircon closed up trains and buses?"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Botanical gardens...very big park and so nice the fresh air,more flowers,fishes,flamingo swan and small water falls river and many mores there....can go picknick also there and bingy jumping and can walk to hiking trill..."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Very beautiful gardens. It’s away from the main touristy areas so it was not very crowded. Great for a few hours of relaxing in the shade or picnicking.  There was an extra charge (I think 4-5$) for the orchid garden but considering the garden is free, why not? Overall, def worth the visit."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Whether for nature lovers or not, it is a must visit garden for the young and old. A World Heritage site with a rich heritage history and collections of wonderful plants and trees."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,It is so nice after a light shower
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"This is one of the most delightful gardens I have ever been to! Lots of very interesting history about the plants of Singapore and wonderfully kept grounds. This place is very large but easy to walk through, with many public bathrooms and places to get food. The area is well paved and it is easy to bring a stroller. Thank  you Singapore for providing this amazing space and keeping it free and open to the public!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,This place is well taken care of. Clean & fresh air 😍
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,It's a relaxing place. The pasta has a very nice bite and pairs wonderfully to the coconut laksa flavor. The pizza is thin and doughy and laden with cheese.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Beautiful place. Had a good time. Good food.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Has a really nice orchid garden with many beautiful orchids. Currently admission is free. Food wise, prices are pretty steep since it is a popular tourist attraction."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Lovely & Beautiful 😍❤
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,It's really good for families and for exercise
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,I love the Botanic Gardens because it's a good place to walk and relax.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"A great way to start a new year in 2020, a large national park with well maintained greenery. One can also view Singapore national flower with a garden just for them - orchids! Children or elderly will find something to do over here. A good place to visit for nature lovers."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Good to do exercise 🏃
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful and peaceful place for a walk by myself.  I saw lizards, terrapins, chickens, birds, fish, dragonflies and monkeys."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"It was really nice. I sat down and had a picnic with my friends and I, and we had a lot of fun. As long as you choose a good spot near some trees, and possibly a gazebo just in case it rains, the view and the place is really nice! I recommend coming here for walks around the park."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Very good for morning exercise, this place is big. Takes a day to explore."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The Grand old lady is getting even better with all the new extensions. The old places have been improved. Now instead of monkeys, there are cockerels and hens running around in the park."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A must see botanic garden in Singapore. Spectacular garden plants and flowers in a peaceful quite setting. Take a few hours out of your day while visiting Singapore  and stroll along the garden paths. The orchid flowers are amazing!
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,An oasis in the middle of a concrete jungle. One of the best places to go for a walk and just revel in natural beauty. The place has restaurants for pitstops and also a beautiful orchid garden. A peaceful place in the cacophony of a hustling and bustling island.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Nice and relaxing place
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"UNESCO Heritage must come place. It is like a stroll in the park but there are a variety of food choices. Swan lake, orchid garden and most important. Instagram ideal spots. That is why most wedding photos choose to be taken here. Apart from wedding shoots... Whenever people engage professional photographers, this is a must go place !"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Definitely must check this out if you like nature and greenery. It's quite a big place, very nice for long walks. Keep an eye out for the wildlife (there's turtles!)."

A UNESCO heritage site in Singapore, this garden is beautiful and interesting. Has vast green landscapes, beautiful plantations, Orchid museum, Bonsai tree garden, sundial, small pondsThere are lakes, orchids, rare trees and wild life hardly found in this small island country. The trails in Botanic Gardens are well paved and smooth, perfect for families with strollers or wheelchairs to come and bask close to nature. There are several attractions and eateries in here which you can explore and spend the entire day."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Great place to go for a walk and enjoy the greenery. Plenty of spots to take break and shelter from the heat when it gets too hot. There are eateries nearby too for a quick meal after a walk
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Always my favourite place to get in some quiet me time (if you know where to avoid the large group excercise/dance spots - you will probably hear loud blasting music and screaming fit instructors anyway). One of the best kept public gardens I've seen around the world.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"An absolute stunning place to spend your worth while time here. If you are a plant and nature lover this place should sure be on your bucket list. We went as a family and we thoroughly enjoyed this place. Botanical garden is so huge and it is not a place which can be covered in 2-3 hours. You need to walk long stretched to experience each part of the garden. If you need to cover this place in one day, it is really hectic considering the tropical weather and the distance to cover. In my opinion if you really want to enjoy this place, do it in 2 to 3 days covering each sections/day. Kids have their own park with mini play areas to enjoy and spend time. Please bring umbrellas just in case, carry a fan and water bottles. Admission to this park is free. You can carry a sheet cloth to spread on the lawn and have some quality time with your family. If lucky you can enjoy a symphony concert on Saturday evenings. Getting out of the Circle Line MRT, the entrance to the park is just outside the MRT entrance."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Spent 4hrs here alone. Walking in the rain, with an umbrella. I enjoyed smells and scents of flowers and trees. And the sights of different fruits and flowers.

When was the last time you experienced a tree?"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Love this place. My wife enjoyed taking her photos here. Intagram - @jacob_loves_bacon_and_cheese and @jacob_eats_bacon_and_cheese
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Bee's knees is a good place to chill out at this moment especially in a quite weekday evening .

Thanks for Rada and team for the good services , we really enjoy the night"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful,  tranquil and free....Can't be better than that! The Orchid garden is well worth the small entrance fee. Continuous creative display throughout the whole year. If you're over 60 then it's only 1 Singapore dollar to go in."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,We were planning to visit Jacob Ballas Children's Garden but there were limited capacity of visitors allowed inside. Decided to walk around Botanic Garden and chance upon this magical place. Also glad there were park rangers around to managed the crowd on Sunday afternoon! Kudos to them.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Lovely place for a weekend walk and picnic

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"What an absolutely beautiful park! When in Singapore please visit this place. It is a convenient place to visit, one of the entrances of right next to the MRT stop. There are some places in the park that you have to pay for but mostly it's completely free.

If you walk from this park to the famous orchid road you will walk past the houses of the ambassadors, which is nice to see."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Our favourite place to go to with family and friends, many beautiful flora and fauna, the garden js also honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Nice place for a  walk

Enjoy Your Gardened Piece Of Mind🙂"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a 161-year-old tropical garden located at the fringe of Singapore's Orchard Road shopping district. It is one of three gardens, and the only tropical garden, to be honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Botanic Gardens has been ranked Asia's top park attraction since 2013, by TripAdvisor Travellers' Choice Awards. It was declared the inaugural Garden of the Year, International Garden Tourism Awards in 2012, and received Michelin's three-star rating in 2008.
The Botanic Gardens was founded at its present site in 1859 by an agri-horticultural society. It played a pivotal role in the region's rubber trade boom in the early twentieth century, when its first scientific director Henry Nicholas Ridley, headed research into the plant's cultivation. By perfecting the technique of rubber extraction, still in use today, and promoting its economic value to planters in the region, rubber output expanded rapidly. At its height in the 1920s, the Malayan peninsula cornered half of the global latex production.
The National Orchid Garden, within the main gardens, is at the forefront of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids, complementing the nation's status as a major exporter of cut orchids. Aided by the equatorial climate, it houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City, an image and moniker for which the nation is widely known. In 1981, the hybrid climbing orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim, was chosen as the nation's national flower. Singapore's ""orchid diplomacy"" honours visiting head of states, dignitaries and celebrities, by naming its finest hybrids after them; these are displayed at its popular VIP Orchid Gardens.
The Singapore's Botanic Gardens is opened from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight daily. There is no admission fee, except for the National Orchid Garden. More than 10,000 species of flora are spread over its 82-hectares area, which is stretched vertically; the longest distance between the northern and southern ends is 2.5 km (1.6 mi). The Botanic Gardens receives about 4.5 million visitors annually."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"One of the bedt places on the world to enjoy nsture , fitness, bird watching and also photography and most kid friendly. From kids to oldage people will love this place."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"I'm a fan of greens, thats why I love the idea of being in botanical garden there. So refreshing in the middle of hustle bustle Singapore. Chill and calm, seeing the plants, flowers and enjoy my time sitting there enjoying the view :)"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Loved the newly VIP Orchid Garden. Well done.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Peaceful and lovely place
Singapore Botanic Gardens,3,"Singapore botanical garden

A botanical garden registered with UNESCO in Singapore.  You can go around while watching many plants.  However, because it is a very large land, if you do not decide where to go in the botanical garden, it will be boring just walking.  For photographers, there are many subjects.  But unfortunately I don't recommend it to those who take videos.

*

There is a university in this botanical garden, so you can have school meals here at noon.  Since it is a very international university, I saw people of various nationalities.  I thought it was Singapore.

*

Probably walked for about 3 hours.  Finally, a big otter was taking a nap so I took a picture."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,This place at night is something else.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Love this place though multiple visits especially younger days, is like saying i grow up seeing it😁 n each time I revisit  it never fails to getting better n better👏👏👏"

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A vacation for the mind. A great way to escape the city and tuck into the calming and soothing embrace of nature.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Enjoyable to walk around, though plan your route around the gardens if hot and stay out of that sun.

Good range of trees, native and non native to rainforests.

But it's the flowers you need to see. In particular the Orchid Garden. Gorgeous blooms and so many species of varying colour and size.

Would imagine throughout the year it's good to visit. We were there in October and still plenty to see."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"These are excellent botanic gardens. There are also ample spaces to have a picnic or hang out with friends in the open grassy areas. There are numerous trails and plenty of wildlife to see including monkeys, lizards, and swans (at the swan lake). I went during phase 2, and people seemed to be social distancing. Of course you have to scan the SafeEntry QR code when you enter the gardens. The entrance is very conveniently located right outside the Botanic Gardens MRT, which is on the circle and downtown lines. I would recommend going on a cloudy day because Singapore is so hot and you will sweat walking around if it is not cloudy."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Good relaxing place for children's and adults
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Forest Park.
Watch out sun.
Fresh air and people there.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A must see for anyone visiting Singapore.  There is no entry fee. A very big garden right on exit of the mrt station. There is a large pond in between and lots of playgrounds with slides and children play areas. Make sure to get some sand play toys if you have toddlers. One can easily spend an entire day here.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Even in the rain this place is a calm and tranquil wander. It’s free to enter,  signposting for direction is sporadic but just about adequate (getting lost wandering is half the fun and beauty) the National orchid garden is S$5 but worth it, the flowers are beautiful.
There’s cafes that serve food, hot drinks and alcohol."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Haven't been to the garden for so long,so many areas to explore. A well balance place, will definitely visit this place again."

A picturesque garden - I almost wanted to take a picture every couple of seconds. Best part was that it was free!

Definitely a must go in Singapore!"

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Such an incredible haven from the busy bustle of the city. Singapore is crowned by many jewels but this must be among the grandest of them all!

The national orchid garden is 100% worth the entrance fee, some of the orchids there are almost other worldly!

This is a must visit for any tourist!"

Tips:
1. Bring water.  Singapore is hot and you will need to rehydrate.
2. Bring an umbrella or raincoat.  We went in December and there are random heavy rains."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Fantastic. Great place to visit, lots to see  plenty of different routes to walk around. Do pay the S$5 entry for the orchid gardens as it is a special place to see all the delicate flowers we struggle to just keep alive absolutely flourishing, well worth the entrance fee. A place to see how good your photography skills really are."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Superb! Amazing gardens - beautiful, well laid out, very well maintained. Many things to explore and enjoy. There’s something here for everyone."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"One of the best Botanic Gardens I've ever been too.
It has plenty of different paths to go through, a lovely restaurant (Casa Verde) and the Orchids garden which makes everyone really happy with all the colours.
Very well taken care of and easy to get to by bus & MRT.
The kids area is also huge and great to hang out."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The main part of the Botanic Gardens is free access, only for the Orchid Garden there is a small entrance fee, which is only 1$ for students. The Gardens themselves are nice to walk in, and the Orchid Garden is beautiful. I would recommend 2 hours for this place. It is definitely worth a visit."

It is a large park with tarmac paths throughout. The plants ,shrubs and trees are all well chosen and stunning specimens.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Definitely worth visit when you're in Singapore. The flowers and trees are beautiful. The on site cafe serves very good fresh food. There is a very interesting Ethnobotany Centre in the grounds.  The orchid garden is fantastic! There are small turtles swimming in the lake.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Dropped by SBG for the new Gallop Extension. The black and white houses were gorgeous and well-furnished. However we even more awed by the staffs at SBG. We received such warm welcome from Joe Chen and David Kong when visiting House 5 & House 7 and they were so knowledgeable about the places. This have uplifted our positive impression of this precious UNESCO heritage site! 😊
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Massive! In the heat and humidity, the cafe in the middle is a true oasis. I enjoyed that a lot. The Gardens l, though, are great. Covers a huge area and as such it boasts a lot of different styles, plants and ecosystems. The rainforest makes for a nice stroll through but the beauty is in the eclectic mix of plants and flowers in various landscapes.

It’s easy to get to using public transport, which stops right outside one of the entrance gates. And it’s free. Happy days.

There are quite a few species of birds in the Gardens too, as an extra treat.

Well worth a visit."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Heritage side.. Really botanic garden.. There are orchid garden, medical plant, lake view, seed bank, etc.. It's good to bring children here, so they can learn much about plant. Good quality of air too, you can have refreshing walk or running around here. It's free to enter all of this.."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Really beautiful plants and great to have an early morning long stroll before it gets really crowded! Never missed the orchid garden and do expect to get sweaty (rmb your sunscreen) with singapore's humid weather.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Walking track, lots of plants n tall tree. Beautiful scenery with animals"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Lovely park to stroll at, either with family, friends or even to walk the dog. Area is very well-maintained and litter-free - part of the reason I visit the place regularly every fortnight. One may pop by any of the gift shops for a small memento, and let the helpful staff there assist you.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,It locates at the centre of city. Nice place for everyone. Well maintained. Worth to walk for half day.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Just an amazing place. We spent almost the entire day just chilling and relaxing. The garden consists of many different sections. Ginger garden, orchid garden etc.. there is a small fee for the orchid garden but well worth the visit. It's one of the most reasonably priced attractions I have been to, and most enjoyable. The orchids are just amazing and it's a great place to get some lovely pictures. There are restaurants in site and also shops for snacks and refreshments. I would personally take a picnic if I visited next time as it's a great place to just unwind. Would reccomend taking plenty of water as there is a lot of walking to do."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Beautiful part of Singapore to visit if you are  into nature and flowers! There are so many pathways it is not likely you will be able to travel all of them in one day. There are multiple entrances into the park and everything is free except the orchid garden which is $5. Plan for several hours and bring lots of water. There are drinking fountains throughout the park as well to refill but the water is not cold.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Very cool place. Park is clean and well planned. There are heaps of open spaces and benches for sitting down. If you need to be at a specific place I would suggest looking online first. It's a big place.

Shops are located in the centre of the park. For like ice cream or cold drinks on a hot day.

Heaps of owners of dogs come out in the evenings so be prepared if you don't like dogs.

You can also see they use automated lawn mowers. Very cool

Food court is at the Tanglin gate. You order at a machine and pick up at various stations. Interesting."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful weather, tree, flower, environment. Inside of the national orchid garden, within the main gardens, is at the forefront of orchid. Beside of orchid garden, we saw a musical live show, that was amazing."

Went there twice, once at night when I almost got lost on it's winding alleys but it felt very safe and it was a nice experience. The second time went there during the day and got to enjoy a good part of it before a thunderstorm started. Plenty of things to visit and the entrance is free. Recommend it"

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Amazing place! I'm in love! So much beautiful! You can stay here full day
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"A great place for morning walks and exercise, with events held in the evenings (check the website for more info). Children can enjoy nature and learn the heritage of Singapore. Restaurants are available if you need a pick-me-up!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Thought I could cover everything in a day. But I was wrong. There is alot to cover which you cant cover by walking. Well maintained and helpful staffs keeps the place at it's best. If you wish to go in morning, I would recommend to carry an umbrella and a bottle of water, as it can be very hot inside. If you are person who really love to get to know about plants I would recommend this place."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Best place to walk... And also to spend relax time with family...in weekend you may find free Concerts with great gathering... This place is declared as world heritage by UNESCO.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,Nice place for family day
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"No doubt one of the must-gos in Singapore. This place takes you away from the harsh concrete facade of the city into the blissful arms of nature. A place for the weary and those who are seeking a quiet place for reflection.

Do note that it involves lots of walking and sheltered walkways are quite rare so be prepared to be one with nature if it rains 😉"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"This is probably the most expansive botanical gardens I've ever been to. I completely underestimated how large the park is, and ended up not making it all the way to the end, despite cranking it up and just fast-walking through the park since the sun was setting. Tons of little gardens inside the park, and even a few exhibits to see like seed harvesting/preservation. Best of all, it's completely free admission, and connected to the MRT.

The end opposite the MRT has a number of restaurants and placed to sit and chill, so consider walking over and starting from that end if you're coming by subway. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy plants and gardens. Just be prepared to do a lot of walking. The Fragrant Garden is not to be missed!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Great views. A good place for an enjoyable picnic day.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,3,The halia was a good place to try their drinks however not much variety for the food though
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Very relax to be there with nature - enjoyed the fresh air.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"This is a Singapore must visit.  Entrance is free to the gardens, and is only $5 for adults to the National Orchid Garden.  That is the best $5 I've spent in a long time.

Most of the gardens are wheelchair accessible, but some inclined pathways are a little steep.  throughly recommend a visit and enjoy your day 🤠!!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Absolutely beautiful garden with some many different exotic orchids and other beautiful sights. Don't forget to bring your hat, water, comfy shoes and always a good camera. Because you can have one of the coolest IG photos in here."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Lovely place for nature lovers 🪴🌲🌿🌾🍂🍁
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The Botanic Gardens is a group of sprawling peaceful and well-planned gardens, rich in flora and foliage, wildlife, makes you feel relaxed and happy, whether alone or with others. At Jacob Ballas Children's Garden alone, I saw a great diversity of animals at different spots, I saw a baby kingfisher dive several times for food at a pond, three waterhens, a black swan preen its feathers and swim about, three water monitor lizards at various spots, many turtles, two squirrels, four species of butterflies and other types of birds all within two hours. Exciting and fulfilling! Especially for photo buffs!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The only Botanical Garden in Asia that was conserved as the Heritage Site. A place one should not miss when visiting Singapore. It has the best tropical garden and the well developed Orchard Garden. It also has many wild lives that roam the garden; it is well known for the Malayan Monitor Lizard, the clouded Monitor lizard, the Changing Lizard, the squirrels, the eagle feeding on the cat fish. Of course many amazing plants too."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,These gardens are an amazing place to walk around. Plenty of shade. We started at North entrance by the Botanic Gardens MRT station and walked across the park to exit at Tanglin Gate to catch a bus back to the city. Plenty of variety to see with different themes.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Free admission and literally outside the MRT station. Very nice area to walk around with animals around the park. A great place for families.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Like anything in Singapore the gardens are well planned. The gardens are very big and you can spend there 5 hours. However, we were there approximately two hours, visited the west side of the park.
Variety of plants, trees, flowers and animals (in the lake).
Some of the activities inside the gardens require entry fees while the entry to the botanic gardens is free of cost.

The topography  and its spread out at different levels gives the visitor a mesmerising experience."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"I had the immense pleasure of coming here during Christmas and the amount of work/ decorations they put everywhere was astounding. On a regular day, the SBG has so many top notch attractions, you could come here for 2-3 days and be surprised with new nature beauty every time. It also looks different during the day vs. night, with its lights.

I really like the Cloud Forest and highly recommend that. Also theres a free outdoor desert plants area with a bunch of game of thrones like chairs made from branches."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Soothing! This place is a treat for the eyes. Well maintained Flora spread over acres. It's just what you need when you want to relax and spend time with your loved ones. It's a perfect picnic spot and also doubles up as a spot for photoshoots. The variety of flora available here is extensive. They have descriptions on them and is quite informative. However it's a long walk and it can get exhausting. Seating is available however not so many. It's metres away from the nearest metro station.

I loved seeing all the orchids at the special orchid garden (5$ to enter for one adult but the rest of the garden is free.) There are quite a lot of people picnicking here on the weekends. There are also quite a few cafes, restaurants and lunch spots but none of them are vegan-friendly and there are only a small handful of vegetarian dishes. I also enjoyed buying fish food on site and feeding the fish and turtles in the ponds."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"The place was clean and had enough signage to guard visitors. Since it is near to an MRT station, it is convenient to visit. The area is clean and one can really say that it is a garden! It has enough benches and light post to guide visitors. It is a great place to run, too.
The Shaw Symphony Stage has a great place for concert events. The uphilled area provides place for relaxed sitting positioned attendees on a clean and green grass. Since, the area was surrounded with trees, it added to a great homey and non-urban feel for concert - goers. The area is clean and spacious."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens is a great way to spend the day and it won't cost a thing unless you want to enter the orchid area (my favorite).

Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Spotted the black swan - the very esteemed resident at the botanical garden. Orchid garden was good but then if you like to skip the ticket queue better do that. Just enjoy the vibe , the smell and the air . Take a long stroll. The reason I gave 4 points is- unlike Europe Singapore does not add botanical explanations n history of the old trees. I was looking for those and didn’t get any."

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"This is a huge botanical garden with a long history. This is now a UNESCO Park. This is a great place to relax and watch nature . There are hundreds of different plants including beautiful orchids found in this garden. We can also see wilds birds , monitor lizards and many different insects ( including butterflies ).  There are also signboards teaching us about the different types of plants and different environment of plants."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Beautiful place to visit if travelling Singapore. Would reccomend to anyone!! The staff were very helpful in showing us the best picturistic spots in the park! Very clean and tidy
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Explored new spot of the botanic garden
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,Lots of mosquitos but the decorations were great
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"It's been quite some time I've been to this place. After some renovation, it's one of Singapore's attractive places to explore n enjoy. We went to the Orchid Park n marvelled at all the wonderful species at close encounter. It's one of the places where u can enjoy a slow walk n immersed in the natural surroundings simultaneously. Good to exercise too!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Great place to spend even whole day. Totally free what makes the park on my top list in Singapore. Definitely worth every second.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful! Such a wonderful garden and FREE! Spent 4 hours there and felt like I could have stayed longer. While roaming all the different sections you’ll fine heaps of interesting facts about the plants. One of my favorite sections was the reflexology path, the sun shines in the area well heating the stones. Take off your shoes and walking across the path."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Nice and peaceful...give the of feel like experienced in deep jungle...get away from busiest town life with energetic nature atmosphire...
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,The Botanic Gardens is a really wonderful place to walk around and leave temporarily the hustle and bustle of the city (as a tourist I pretty liked it). Visit the Orchid Garden (which has  a 5SGD fee) and the few heritage gardens beyond... these are well maintained and have a subtle British garden vibe. It might be hot in the noon time so it might be better to go in the morning or late afternoon and to bring water with you.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Very nice place. Easy to get there. Can spend a half day there. Have restaurants. Have many nice plants
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Good place to discover plants from different parts of the world. Orchid garden is really good. It has a cool-house specially for orchids which need colder climate to survive.

Singapore botanic gardens is a nice place to spend a weekend with family."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"This gardens is very scenic.  Top attractions are: Orchid Garden, Ginger Garden, Swam Lake.  It is huge (82 hectares)! To get a detailed map such as getting to gate entrances, getting to various gardens etc, refer to the following. Very useful!

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Haven't been here for so long
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Nice place to meet unspoiled and non-artificial Singapore Nature. One can spent several hours in this nice garden, and of course - the adjacent Orchid Garden. Everything is well - maintained, kept, designed. There are most of all asphalt tracks,but also some wooden pathways through the ""city jungle"". In march 2018 no mosquitoes, so no need to take precautions. There are some ponds, or even lakes, with swans and other fowl, and some wandering cocks in the ""jungle"". Different trees from different parts of the world, arranged in groups and thematically."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Good place for jogging and family outing as well. Kids will love the orchid gardens and the lake with lot of turtles and ducks.

It is free to enter these gardens, but there are no free drinking water taps. However, there are several cafes here."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"A great place to explore plants and trees. Also a perfect place for bird lovers and photographers.  Except for the orchid garden, the Singapore botanic Gardens is totally free. Access is wheelchair friendly. A great addition is the heritage garden, the Ethnobotany Garden with a informative small museum attached. And if you’re lucky you will find the otters in Swan lake."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,So many flora to discover
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,A great garden to spend  cool morning wondering around. The garden is very well maintained and the walk around is quite easy when it’s not too hot.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Had a great time over the weekend at Botanic Gardens. So much things to see so much things to do.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Totally worth the visit. One of the free things to see in Singapore. If you would be here, you should totally visit the orchid garden. It's like 5x more beautiful than the rest of the gardens 👌"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Nice and cool place around the morning to walk, jog and all kinds of exercises. There are yoga sessions all around the place in small groups. There’s separate sections for kids and place for breakfast. Well organised, clean and comfortable for peaceful activities."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,wonderful place...my favourite is 'rain forest'.we go to exercise at least once every two weeks.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Fun spot to go to on a date or a day out with friends! Entrance is free, but entrance to the orchid garden is 2$, which is still pretty reasonable. Mostly greenery, not too too many flowers but they have roosters!!! The Juju place had a very refreshing vegan ice cream treat as well!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"A beautiful garden is the city where you can have a nice walk or jogging in the morning or evening.

You can even see wild animals such as roosters, squirrels and swans."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Hosts a wide variety of orchids each named after Famous and important personalities from all round the world. Beautiful and scenic place to enjoy a day in a hot summer day. Lost for words to explain this beautiful place, hence the pics😉"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Recommended for anyone who loves lush greenery. There is an MRT station and bus stop next to one of the gates. Admission is free except for the orchid garden. There are also several animals roaming the premises including frogs, lizards and otters. Be prepared to spend several hours in the garden if you want to see everything and wear comfortable shoes. There are several drinking fountains scattered throughout the garden but bringing a water bottle is recommended because you will do a lot of walking. Most of the park is accessible to people with mobility issues but there are some stairs here and there though there is also usually an alternative path to avoid them."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Serene green oasis with colorful birds (including chicken walking about) and flowers.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,The most beautiful destination in the city. It is huge with a big variety of vegetation zones and themes. I could easily spend a whole day there. There is also places that serve quite good food.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Nature lovers, welcome to Botanical gardens, students can learn a lot, leaves, structures, flowers, types, in detail. Biology students it's your valuable place. Overall everyone can enjoy the beautiful nature. It is so overwhelming to feel the nature  u can sense if it is drizzling or showering."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Nice place to spent the day. Just go for a walk and let the beautifull garden surprise you. I loved it.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Lots of different sections to explore. Many benches to rest on, bring mosquito repellent though."
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,"Nice place, we saw a really big lizard !.

Here is how you make pancakes

Whisk 1 1/2 cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl.

Whisk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, 4 tablespoons melted butter and 1 egg in a separate bowl; fold into the flour mixture until just combined (it's OK if there are some lumps).

Brush a large nonstick skillet or griddle with butter and heat over medium-low heat. Add ¼ cupfuls of batter and cook until bubbly on top and golden on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the bottom, about 2 more minutes. (Makes 6 to 8 pancakes.)"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Amazing place to visit
Everyone can enjoy there
Very clean and quite environment"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,4,It was a relaxing and enjoyable experience with so many beautiful colourful flowers and trees surrounded in Singapore Botanical Garden. A great place to chill out with family loved ones and friends for gathering.
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,It’s beautiful! Saw a few roosters walking around. It’s a great place to just take a stroll. It has many benches along the way for you to sit and relax as well. We saw some people having picnic as well. Perfect for all ages!
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"True paradise, this  place is amazing. The orchid exhibit was fantastic. Unbelievably beautiful. Went on a Saturday and lucked out with the symphony playing.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,.An excellent place for peace and quiet amongst nature's fauna and flora. Within the garden lies restaurants and bars as well as souvenir shops. A must visit place
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,So green and beautiful    one of my favourite places
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,"Beautiful garden, very well maintained, with LOTS of areas to explore. You could easy spend anywhere from 2hrs to almost a whole day here. Parts of the garden doesn't have any shade so it can be challenging to tour the whole garden in a day. I would happily come back again to see everything during different seasons!"
Singapore Botanic Gardens,5,Great place to walk and explore. Many eateries everywhere. Parking plenty and elder and handicap friendly.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It's a good thing to go on a weekday now and you should go for the earliest slot of 8am if possible. It's really serene and tranquil at that hour. Makes it really good for children to explore without the crowd until 11am like that. So that's a good 3 hours of exploration in the zoo without the crowd.

Also there's a new animal playground show coming soon, where Inuka the polar bear exhibition was. It says coming soon, but no news when it's starting. The place is fully done up and accessible for public to see and sit though."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,What an amazing experience! Words can't describe how simply awesome and beautiful this zoo is. My family and were super tired walking but it was really worth the trip.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing place to spend half day for kids. Lots of ground to cover, many wonderful shows, hundreds of beautiful and exotic animals from several continents. Most of the enclosures are huge for the animals and birds to roam around. Reptile garden has huge collection of reptiles and the show of feeding large snakes seems to be a huge hit. Live feeding to large animals of prey is another crowd puller.
Shows including Orangutan, elephants, sea lions, are also very popular and it is witnessed in the crowds and the giggling and laughter sounds during the shows.
Taking pictures with parakeets and Sea lion etc is charged but serves a lifetime memory.
If you are in Singapore, have half day with kids, don't miss it."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"My 60 years old mum had never gone to a zoo before, and it is safe to say that she had the best of her time there since the pandemic started! This was my 2nd time coming here this year and I still had blast. The little boat ride is so underrated but it was so much fun, and do remember you can always ask for a 2nd round :) The entire park is very well maintained, clean, and the animals are taken care with love. Food pricing is reasonable, and the amenities are pretty well spread out for convenience. Don't miss the shows! You have to come in early and book a spot 90 minutes before the show starts so plan your journey well."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Was here very2 long time ago, glad there's some few changes coming in the Singapore zoo.. There only one pick up and drop off. Point outside the attraction and its shelter.. As for the attraction is was good like always... Great to bring along your kids"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,We really had a good time here and saw almost all animals. You need to scan QR Code located at the respective show venue to reserve your seats that opens 90 minutes before show time.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing place with ample amount of wildlife and exotic creatures. It is very good place to visit with friends and family as it helps to make stronger bonds with them. Though it is quite busy at sometimes in the day, you still have the same amount of fun there. There are some food stalls open outside the entrance and not inside the zoo. So it is advised to eat first, then go inside."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Always a great time at the zoo! My daughter had a blast! The highlight of the day was the show with the sea lion, such an amazing animal."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,A beautiful zoo that keeps animals in a natural setting. There are so many exotic animals in this zoo. It is more a natural park than a zoo. They should make more zoos like this in other countries.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very nice place and family friendly! They have a variety of animals here from Africa to Australia and there are a few surprises like the saki monkey in fragile forest! 😀
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"2021 update: While it's heartening to know that the Singapore zoo tries its best on #conservation efforts, the variety of animals and its population count is not spectacular. For example, during my visit, I could only spot 2 crocodiles and some enclosures were closed.

The animal shows are fantastic and you can learn so much on how the zoo helps animals thrive and supports conservation. In any case, it's a great place for a nice stroll with the family and enrich children's experiences with animals up close.

Also, there are plenty of kid-friendly theme parks and playgrounds around to keep the little ones busy and happy."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I’m not a big fan of zoos, but this one is good because the animals seem to be well taken care of.

The whole experience is fun as you walk around the zoo and the animals are very close by and most of them are not trapped in cages. You should be able to see all type of monkeys, Kangaroos, tigers, lions, giraffes and even a couple of pandas.

It’s a good experience to enjoy with family or friends.

Make sure you wear sunscreen!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore zoo is the best! And it's SO MUCH fun! I have been here a couple of times and it's exciting to see the animals every time! The shows are fantastic, the animal keeping is amazing, the range of animals, birds and reptiles are so diverse! I love being here and would highly recommend this everyone (with or without kids)!! The only downside is it's expensive food/beverage. Else, you have plenty of water fountains to fill up your water bottles. The zoo is a must see in Singapore :)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place to visit with friends or family. Not many food stalls open but there are a few located just outside the entrance. Ticket booths were not open so recommend to buy tickets online. Very busy
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"My boys enjoy the trip and saw quite a lot of animals. Walk for 3.5hrs and watch 2 shows. Some rest areas fans were not working. If weather is not so warm and humid, will love to cover a little more."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Excellent, great place, one of the best zoo you can visit in the world. Elephant show and Bird shows are great, you may see all kinds of animals from North Pole to South Pole, other than animals there are some interesting plants as well."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A popular go-to place in Singapore, the zoo offers a myriad of exhibits from all over the world. A whole day is needed just to observe the magnificent to tiny creatures on land and in water, with regular highlights of animals and fishes from faraway lands. For younger visitors, in addition to the latest adventure climbs, there are shows and tram & boat rides as well as petting areas to touch the friendlier creatures."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I have been to this wonderful place many times since childhood and since my two princess were born. Now we are here again with our two grown up teenagers.  It is still a wonderful experience as we do not know what we going to get to see each time we visit, there are always surprises from animals' behaviour.  Very nice place to spend time with loved
ones and friends.  Keep it up !😁👍👍👏👏"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I've only shared with you a pinch of pictures I've taken . Shld visit ! It's one of the best zoo in the world (according to xxx sources). Furthermore, they having a promotion now - free annual zoo member by purchasing zoo tickets on their website .

Toilet - clean.
Food & drinks in zoo - reasonably priced

Appreciate the nature & animals, good for body & soul by some exercising & greeneries, learning new knowledge, - being present there will definitely put a smile on your face and in heart; enjoy"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great experience. Otters exhibit was closed for the day but we found them swimming in the mote around the monkey exhibit ^_^
It seemed monkeys were very free to roam, I even watched one climbing the tree behind the sink while I washed my hands in the restroom (open aired restroom).
Beware there is a store that sells $7.90 piece of chocolate brownie but there is zero brownie in it. Definitely 100% chocolate cake with chocolate icing on top. Still yummy but dry."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of Singapore's iconic place to visit with kids. Love the Fragile Forest where small animals are allowed to roam freely.

Would be better if there's a tram station added to the KidzWorld stop as the walk between the 2 existing stops are far for young children. More feeding and show times can be considered for earlier timeslots in the morning."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Unfortunately most of the animals disappeared and shows were cancelled due to the safety measures. Also it was very quiet for a Saturday and most of the food places were closed. Luckily I could park my bicycle at the parking lot all day for free.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The zoo is clean, well organised and kept. their staff are friendly. Good to bring and spray insect repellent. Water coolers are available at rest areas, good to buy tram ticket easy to move around the 4 stations. Came on a hot day, so good to bring an umbrella or a cap."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,It was great except for all the works going on. A few exhibits were closed. But otherwise fun for the kids.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,As beautiful and close to nature as I remembered. A day well spent...
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,There is a crowd control. Limited people allowed every hour. Limited seating for shows. Show times reduced... But very enjoyable as always...
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo is one of the most important zoos in the world. Its variety of animals and the diverse activities it organizes are the envy of other parks. It occupies an area of 28 hectares.
In the Singapore Zoo you will find more than 3,600 animals of 400 species including an impressive collection of primates. The great advantage of the park is its ""open zoo"" style, where the animals are only separated by natural barriers.
Among the most characteristic animals are the white tigers and white rhinos.
What better way to start the morning than having a nutritious breakfast accompanied by large primates? That's what the thousands of people who attend the Singapore Zoo breakfast every year think."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Good. To. Re visit the Singapore zoo.. Sadly some attractions are closed... But still had a good time
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Be warned, I spent around 5-6 hours in the zoo,but it was worth it. Recommend for a family trip. Or with friends .Either way, the zoo is very organized. Possibly the largest zoo in South east Asia, lots to see,lots of food, educational infos every where, there are places to rest , a restaurant . It's better to dress appropriately because it can be hot and humid. Have fun."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"best zoo I have even been to. The absence of cage and well designed moat around most enclosures allows us with unobstructed view of the animals in their natural habitat, albeit man made. The animals looked comfortable and well fed. The grouping of the enclosure and the pathway leading to them make for a joyful trip of discovering. The wordings are just sufficient to introduce the important points about the animals. Staff are helpful and happy. A great 3 hours trip. In terms of refreshment, lots of drink vending machine can be found with small food kiosk and a food court. Oh, there’s also a KFC at the end of the zoo before you turned back and head to the entrance/exit."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Although it rain like cats and dogs, we enjoy the zoo. The  numerous  species of animals never fails to amaze me. The shows are great too."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Beautiful scenery with amazing creatures awaiting to surprise you.
If you are here in Singapore for the first time, this is definitely a place you should not MISS."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Zoo is awesome. Very well maintained, great enclosures and you are very close to the animals. Lots of informative boards to read about all background information. Plan at least 4 hours for a visit."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Loved the experience there. Catch all the shows because it is worth the time and interaction. Some exhibits were closed due to upgrading so do check beforehand. My favourite was the fragile forest to see the butterflies and the bats. Totally worth it!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Be warned, I spent around 5-6 hours in the zoo,but it was worth it. Recommend for a family trip or w friends .Either way, the zoo is very organized. Possibly the largest zoo in South east Asia, lots to see,lots of food, educational infos every where, there are places to rest , a restaurant . It's better to dress appropriately because it can be hot and humid. Have fun."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Lotsq Fun for kids and adults. Some changes in the animals, which makes it more interesting for this visit"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"At that time i went there, The weather was not too hot. Hey guys repair mosquito spay, drink more water. Hope you will enjoy weekend there☺️"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A place to visit if you like to see animals. The zoo is designed to have an open concept so you will see the animals living 'freely' rather than kept behind metal cages. The entire zoo has a kind of happy vibe going on and it's positivity shows in the animals as well. Also, info boards about the animals are available for those who are interested to know more. All in all, a good place to spend the day in Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Haven’t been to the zoo for many years and it is good to see the animals very well taken care. Their beautiful coat of fur or feathers and being so comfortable in their habitat are things that I am so glad the zoo maintain for the animals.
Managed to see the white tiger active which was the highlight for me."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The private buggy tour is recommended where you get to see and touch some reptiles and snakes. You also get to go into the tortoise enclosure and touch them. Lastly, you get priority queue to feed the giraffes as well. Our guides Sean and Bridgette were great!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It was a really fun experience. I went to the zoo to have some education and fun. Finally, I know different kinds of animals that I never knew. But, it was really tiresome because me and my family only walk to certain places and never use the tram. It is tiresome, but it is good for your body as well. I highly recommend to go here with your family and/or friends."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The lights are  really  cool it's worth  walking  around  for an hour......
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best zoo I have ever seen. Maybe the best zoo around the world according to the media. If you come to Singapore, this is a place you shouldn't miss."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"In most zoos you don’t see animals that are very happy, but here they look and seem so carefree and relaxed. Singapore Zoo has spacious habitats for each exhibit, which makes it a better experience for both the people and the animals!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"My family and I visited it recently, it was a great experience! We had booked animal feeding, and the staff were soo helpful, accommodating, and pleasant.

I recommend to get a tram tickets if you have a toddler or an infant or you are not a fan of walking, its really helpful specially when your child is tired. Also I'd recommend that you watch out for the weather,  as it has a large factor on the trip."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the world’s best zoos. Singapore zoo is huge and beautiful also very well managed.
They’ve river Safari, Amazon river quest and night Safari. None of the safaris will disappoint you.
You’ll find all those animals here which we rarely get to see.
When you plan a visit to this zoo make sure you’ve an entire day in hand. It’s on the other side of the city. Singapore has most of the attractions towards Sentosa but this one sets out quite far.
Attaching a few pictures from zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Had an amazing time at the zoo. Definitely worth the money. It will take about 4 hours to have a complete tour of the zoo at a normal pace. Due to the current lock down, make sure to buy KFC or whatever you want to eat before you enter as shops and restaurants inside are closed. Buy the ticket online from Lazada, that's the cheapest price I found."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place for adults and kids to learn about the animals from around the world.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Buy your tickets online, book your slots including feeding sessions in advance to avoid disappointment.

There is construction around and about the place, so mind the turns to parking and the drop off point.

I recommend planning your trip before you get there because they only allow booking of shows 90min ahead of time on site with the on site QR Code. You will receive a text and / or email with your assigned seating area. ..though I must say, perhaps it is the New Norm standards, but the shows are a tad less engaging with less animals to ""WoW"" at compared to previous visits. There are seats tagged with their own QR codes at the shows, so scan in once you get to your assigned area, sit back and enjoy the show.

The Singapore Zoo is still a magical land of discovery and perhaps due to the lesser footfall, the animals seem to come out and closer to people a lot more than before.

Absolute highlights were seeing the Iguanas up close, the Hornbill, and the Slot eating! There were so many birds I didn't know were in the Zoo...or are they possibly on loan from the Bird Park who is getting a face-lift? Either way, it was a gorgeous visit albeit raining in quick showers.

For those looking to dine in, social distancing is strictly enforced, a tad scary with the amount of times we saw patrolling staff and there is a significantly smaller number of tables available, so beat the crowd or pack a meal."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A place for entire family to get relaxed and be stress free for all ages.

Love the environment and the Greenary.  I am frequent visitor to ZOO."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Beautiful place. Can easily spend 1 whole day. Food are relatively inexpensive and nice. Lots of shade in the zoo. No worries about strong sun.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Went to the zoo using the Singapore rediscovery vouchers and the zoos 1 for 1 promo tickets during the school holidays.

It took us around 5 hours to finish the zoo and the 3 shows available during this visit. Including lunch.

The shows have a system of registering 90 mins before the show starts, which is a good idea. However, depending on the shows, some spots may be left vacant due to people not turning up eventually. So if u missed a reservation, just go and try your luck if they accept last minute sit ins.

I felt things that could be improved further:
1) shows can be better presented. Some of the pronunciations were not very clear (maybe due to the mask)
2) zoning can be better demarcated on the maps.
3) Since maps are no longer printed and are mostly used via scanning from QR code, the zoo should not fear putting the showtimes on the latest map and editing it as and when necessary. If this was a paper map, understand on the complications. But this is e-map so they should try it.

Nevertheless, Singapore Zoo is an awesome place and we had an awesome time there. Keep up the good work."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I love the setting of our Zoo, feel relax coming here and enjoy seeing those animals. My son love to visit since young and he learnt a lot and love animals. Definitely a must-visit attraction to all tourist and even local family. Is convenient to travel there by public bus too. Will visit again soon !"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Amazing place.It not be compare with any other place în the world.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Thou the main entrance is undergoing major upgrade and renovation, the Zoo is still worth visiting and a great outdoor place for both Adults and Children."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great fun for the kid & family. Finally some life show is back. Hope e small animal feeding resume soon
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We have visited this place in rainy season.. don't worry if you forget umbrella you will purchase temporary rain coat or hire an umbrella from shops ..

Huge parking at outside

Well maintained

Tip :-  use mosquito cream to prevent

Tip :- go at morning or in late evening

This is huge zoo try to see each and every place by maps ( will be provided at the time of purchasing tickets 🎫)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,My 1st visit after maybe more than 20 years. Wow the zoo has really transformed to a wonderful world class attraction. No wonder it's rated one of the top 10 zoos in the world. The creatures are in an open environment therefore able to roam in their environments respectively. You gotta see it to believe it. Getting there is so easy as well. A must visit place if you are in Singapore
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Yet another marvel at Singapore to visit. It houses a large number species of animals  - herbivore, carnivore and aquatic. Talking about the zoo, it is extremely well maintained and up kept. Coming to the animals, they are very well looked after, well fed and extremely well taken care of. The animal care takers are affectionate towards the animals and their needs.
Also, there are scheduled bird and animal shows (twice a day).
This zoo not only takes care of its animals but also of its visitors - there is a shuttle service available in case you are too tired to walk around the zoo and is available at a very minimal price for the whole day.
OMG I can't stop myself from elaborating more and more about this place... So now you know it's a must visit place when you are in Singapore...!!!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A must visit when in Singapore, expect to walk a lot, it almost takes half of your day to visit this place.
The tickets are recommended to be purchased from Klook where it cost about S$36.90 for an adult.
Food is also rather expensive in their foodcourt but other than that a fun experience.
Sheltered rest areas (air-conditioned and with fans) are scattered around for visitors to get some shade and take a short break. Overall a satisfying visit!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,1,"Disappointed, never know that the singapore zoo animal was so little. My son don't have the chance to see giraffe and zebra.

We reach there about 1.30pm, we spend 1.5hours to river safari, and 2 hours at zoo, we walk until end around 4.50pm to reach the giraffe and zebra place, but there was no animal at all.

My son fell sad and keep asking where giraffe and zebra.

Better wear long pants and long Sleeve, a lot of mosquito."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The Singapore Zoo is one of the best zoos I have visited in the world. The animals are kept in enclosures which are designed as of they are in a natural environment. You won't feel they are caged at all. The whole experience is wonderful. Also visited the Water Safari which is a new addition to the zoo. Wonderful unique experience and should not be missed.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"Good crowd management. Much construction is still in progress as many spots are boarded up. Pity, no chance to sight the majestic tigers as the enclosure was being spruced up.  The ostriches didnt look too good, a little dishevelled and not well groomed.  F&B options limited unless you are prepared to spurge."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Had an enjoyable day, no crowd which was great to move around, shows require to book 1.5hrs before the actual show timings by scanning the QR code there! Thankful to be able to utilise the SRV to purchase the tix!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Love our zoo. It could only better if the weather is less hot 😉
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Super fun place to visit!   This time we booked feeding animals ( Elephant and Giraffe) in advance.   Fantastic experience for my daughter.   Lots of fun and great photos.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,We have a pleasant time hanging out with friends and watching animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Went to Zoo during Covid Phase 3 Weekday.
Not that crowded, since its weekday and you need to book a timeslot to get in.
Only the Elephant Presentation is suspended.
Do take note of the showtime of other shows and scan their QR codes at the venue beforehand, to reserve your seats.
If you are looking to go close to the elephants, consider visiting them during feeding time so you can get up close with them ($5 per feed)."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Love the animal feedings but please remember to purchase online first! Limited slots so book early. You can book tram tickets online also. Hassle free booking and entry to the Zoo. Some animal shows are still available but on a first come first serve basis because of social distancing measures so plan your visit in advance.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Its worth visiting this zoo. Animals here are well taken care off. The enclosures and the area around them are really clean. Once you enter the zoo, an enclosure with few species of penguins are worth watching. Also the scientists and zoo keepers have a room where their eggs are hatched in an incubator and controlled environment."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Had a fabulous time at the zoo with a very knowledgeable guide for our Discovery tour. Caught most of the animal shows as well and participated in animal feedings as well as tortoise interaction.

The Singapore Zoo is really a wonderful place for the young and old alike to get close to animals and learn more about them."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Singapore Zoo, formerly known as the Singapore Zoological Gardens or Mandai Zoo, occupies 28 hectares (69 acres) on the margins of Upper Seletar Reservoir within Singapore's heavily forested central catchment area. The zoo was built at a cost of $9 million granted by the government of Singapore and opened on 27 June 1973. It is operated by Wildlife Reserves Singapore, who also manage the neighbouring Night Safari, River Safari and the Jurong Bird Park. There are about 315 species of animal in the zoo, of which some 16 percent are considered to be threatened species. The zoo attracts over 2 million visitors every year."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We always enjoy coming to the Singapore Zoo. So much so that we decided to buy the season pass. The zoo itself, including night safari and river safari, feature an impressive amount of creatures from all over the globe. Seems we find something new every time we visit. Great way to spend a day or multiple days when in Singapore. Very fortunate to have this right in our backyard."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Trails and environment are great. Too bad penguin species only one type, probably at equator country. Food is reasonable. Also due to covid, show time full in short time even reach earlier 15min. Panda is so cute and they looks so comfy in zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Had amazing time here! Booked the morning private tour and the children had a blast! Thanks to our tour guides, Sean n Benjamin!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Singapore Zoo is the best zoo I have ever visited. The animals are in enclosures that are so natural they don't appear to be caged. The animals look well kept and seem so healthy. The surrounding gardens are tropical with beautiful flowers everywhere. It is such a pleasant place to walk around or hop on and off the train. Great place to visit
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo without a doubt is one place everyone should visit once is a while. It's well kept, friendly staff, the Singapore hospitality as always, clean and green. Even during tough times this place is well maintained.

Plenty of shade, plenty of resting places, photo taking opportunities, water fountains to fill up your water bottles, trams still running up and down the zoo.

Only downside is the price of food within the Zoo. It is much more than what you would pay outside. If only that aspect of the experience is taken note of and prices adjusted it will be a fulfilling experience.

We missed the shows as all of the seats have pre-booked on a first come first serve basis and we missed out the opportunity. Of-course one cannot expect the animals to perform again and again for everyone who have missed the opportunity.  It's the only thing we missed when we visited.

FANTASTIC!!!!.

To all the keepers in the Zoo. Thank you for your dedication and effort. You are as always AWESOME!!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Not giving 5 stars, as I was bit disappointed by the fauna, specifically the mammals, they are just symbolic and renders a dull perception, like a solo Lion, a single tiger and a leopard, three zebras and so on. Often the Zoo Keepers don’t keep all animals for display and viewing, they kind of follow a batch system. A more populous group of each species will make it more lively.
However, the river safari is amazing as it gives one a holistic glimpse of the fauna of the major mighty rivers of the world.
The various fish forms are the most iconic sites, from tigerfish to mammoth sturgeons everything is phenomenal.

Singapore Zoo is definitely is a must visit if you are in Singapore and for an animal lover a full day where one is ready to walk at least 10-12 kms is needed to enjoy most of the attractions offered.

The panda enclosure is beautiful place to see these docile animals and will be a certain relief from immense humidity for a small interval.

Zoo also has an amazing souvenir shop and one can buy stuff over there, needless to say there are umpteen vending machines, Juice squeezer booths and nice food kiosks including KFC."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Animals are having a nice time chilling. Beautiful place :)
Great place to visit. Going to get the annual pass (friends of the zoo) so we can come more often"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Wonderful zoo. Main attraction Primate zone for kids. Also rhino, giraffes, zebras..... elephant show is closed now, which is not reflected in the website till date."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"it's all looks healthy animal & well organized for pandemic situation, we can buy snacks also inside the zoo & all route is stoller-friendly, nice!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Exhibits set in natural environment and not in cages.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,it is a fun place to go with your family. may be crowded and food places always have queues though. enough content for around 2+ hours. River Safari is also close by so it is convenient to come here for a whole afternoon of 接触大自然 activities!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Really good zoo, extremely well designed, planned and covers a wide variety of wildlife. Also great to see wildlife in their natural habitats and surroundings.
Weekends tend to be crowded, hence best to visit on a weekday if possible.
Infrastructure and facilities are great -  water taps, vending machines and washrooms every few hundred metres.
Buy tram tickets online - can be bought online only and useful to navigate across extreme ends of the zoo"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Awesome place to bring family, friends and loved ones"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Our trip to the Singapore Zoo was quite a lot of fun. We were lucky that there weren’t a lot of people visiting so we were able to pace ourselves and see all the animals without a rush. The zoo is well maintained and the animals looked quite well fed and healthy, which is a good sign. If you haven’t been to the zoo, you are surely missing out."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Timely is of importance to enjoy the trip without queues. Important to schedule your trip in the morning to enjoy the live shows and also animal feedings. Fresh air  in some areas especially the amazons settings. Love the cool weather as well in the rainforest setup.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Had a good time!! Even though some of the exhibits are closed, with the limited crowd able to watch the animals more clearly!!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Went on a weekday! Best timing to actually start exploring the zoo is actually 930am, 830am was too early 😅 Explored and went to every single attractions except for feeding animals. Splash safari attraction is still my favorite!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"As a dad of animal loving kids, my kids love going to the zoo. Whenever we are on an overseas holiday, we will check out the zoos over there as part of our itinerary!

The Singapore Zoo remains on the top of our favourite zoo list.

Besides being a traditional zoo where you can see the usual lions and zebras, animals in the Singapore Zoo here live in very cosy and spacious landscaped environments, which is also simulating their natural habitats and at the same time, setting up natural barriers for protection to the visitors.

Take for example, moats to keep the tigers from jumping out and high vegetation to protect little children from running into the zebras land.

Other than the usual animals you may expect from a regular zoo, there are also rare animals and endangered ones such as the White Tiger.

Plenty of animal presentations and also exhibits. There is also a children play park so that you can rest for a while and let the kids go wild.

Definitely worth the time and money for a visit to the Singapore Zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Quite a okay experience at the zoo during this covid period.. But take note that some parts of the zoo is currently under renovation and some animals exhibition are closed until further notice.

However, please take note to book the seats for the shows if you intend to go. But you can only book when you're onsite as it's location base."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Definitely the star attraction among the four destinations of Wildlife Reserves Singapore. The beauty of the animals roaming not in cages and the quality of the specimens would definitely make this the best zoo in the world.

My personal favourite would be Wild Africa featuring giraffes, zebras and lions and the elephants. The dancing baboons, the orang utans and Komodo dragons should not be missed."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The river safari and the night safari were the highlights of my trip. Here's one tip a nice employee told me for the night safari: when the tour first opens, take the tram to see the animals first, then come back to the gate area to watch the live performance. Everyone else does the opposite, hence it was easier for me to see the nocturnal animals due to a smaller crowd."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,The staffs that work at the tram was very helpful and the it's very fun to tour around. The only downside is that some animals are not available to see so it's a bit disapointing.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Got to feed Growy the giraffe - made my visit as this is what I specifically came to do. Typical Singaporean perfection with attention to standards lacking in most zoo's around the world. Animals are kept in top notch enclosures and seem genuinely happy to people watch. Its like we humans are they're zoo. The animals were very interested in us at almost every exhibit. This is a sure sign of there contentment.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Really cool place to spend the day with the family or your significant other. We spent three hours there and covered most of the zoo and saw all the major animal attractions. There are shade stations throughout the zoo but it is advisable to wear sunscreen and bring an umbrella.

There are opportunities to feed the animals like rhinos, giraffes, and elephants but you have to book it early when you are booking your tickets."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Perfect experience to see all the animals. Needless to say, it is still one of the best zoos in the world."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Visited both the Zoo and river safari and can say that especially with the lack of international travel at the moment, this is a worthwhile experience if you’ve not been before and think you even “might” like the idea of a zoo. Am not an animal person myself but the sheer variety of species is very impressive, and although at times felt enclosures where a bit small (full disclaimer first zoo I’ve ever been to so not an expert here though) there was plenty of explanation of how they look after the animals and that many of the animals are placed in the zoo for conservation reasons also.

Would advise that a lot of the river safari other than the boat ride is indoors so if don’t mind missing the boat ride (which is an extra 5sgd anyways) then it’s worthwhile doing that in the event of rain. You wouldn’t think of it from the name but the river safari resembles more an aquarium than a safari so if you like fish/water then wouldn’t miss this part.

Other highlights of the actual zoo were the lions and the Pygmy hippos both of which had not seen up close.

The food inside the zoo is reasonably priced given the location and a lot of choice. If you want kfc though there’s only one before you go in (seems the one in the park was closed when we went)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Wonderful zoo always looking at a different uplift experience. Worth spending a day looking at the animals which were very showing during these days. Indeed a place worth visiting during this time of the year.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Never a dull day at the zoo. You can easily spend a day there if you want see all the animals and shows.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Singapore Zoo is one of the best attraction Singapore has to offer , from wild cats like Lion King to the King Kong and even Kong Fu Panda ! Must visit"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Very good place for weekend getaways with family and friends.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Night experience is really great. Cooling and seeing a different view of Singapore Zoo.
Keep it up the great work"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the place that you children would love most . The Zoo where they can see and experience the different types of animals . They can even ride on the elephants or the pony . A good place to spend your weekends with your young children.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Quite a wide diverse range of animals to be discovered here and definitely would warrant another visit soon!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Here to share my experience overall attending an afternoon session. The blistering sun was not actually much of an issue with tons of shades around even when walking.

You'd have to remember to book the feeding of animals online prior to your day of visit. This wasn't told to me (at least not from the e-tickets I received). If you're lucky, you may get a slot on the spot but the chances are really slim. The giraffe and elephant feedings are the most popular.

If you're into shows, there are currently 2 running and you can register on the day itself 60 or 90 minutes before the show starts via a QR code there.

I'm not sure about the morning slot, but when I head over in the noon, a lot of the animals are not seen. They are either hiding somewhere in the shade far back of the enclosure or sleeping. Probably food coma or something, idk. So, if seeing of animals is of utmost importance, consider going in the morning. You may have a higher chance.

There are not much food choices, so take note of this. Some of them are not even open.

The staff here are perpetually helpful, so that was a really nice touch! They are very on the ball about safe distancing guidelines, which I appreciate.

Lastly, I went on a weekday noon and I saw less than 100 unique visitors throughout my whole visit. I'd consider this a plus point for me. One of the guides told me that mornings are always more packed."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Had nice experience visiting Singapore Zoological Park. Good place for kids. Had close contacts with the animals and butterflies in an enclosed area. The animals are looking Happy, carefree and not lonely, does not really feel as if they are being caged. Due to covid, there are some areas being closed. The Park is huge, will require to spend hours to finish the walk. Tram is available but is charged separately."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Had lots of fun going to the zoo after a really long time!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Handling crowd well. Zoo is not crowded on weekdays. Shows are still going on, good crowd control. Exhibits are open except a few. Reptopia is really 😎 cool.. air-conditioned."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Went here multiple times, the experience is always different each time I visit this place.

Love all the animals! ❤️"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo is the must go place no matter you are tourist or local Singaporean. A lot of construction around the zoo area, even the zoo entrance is renovating now. There are still plenty to see inside the zoo, like the lion, giraffe. When we were there few weeks ago, one of the show was close (Animal friends show), but other shows are still great. The queue for the show is long and should go 20-30 mins earlier in order to get a seat as the number of audience is restricted due to COVID.
There are quite a number of wild monkeys inside the zoo and trying to get food from the rubbish bin when I visited. The staff should better find some ways to get rid of those wild monkeys for better visitor experience."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"You can see macaques along the way, very neat for kids. The zoo is moving to a different location soon, catch it while you still can 👍 Expanded car park allows for more parking space"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Visited Singapore Zoo during Phase 2. Not many animals though and mostly are hiding. Saw the rhino, giraffe, ostrich, monkeys, orangutan, leopard, pelicans, lions."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Currently requires booking online be sure to check if all the slots for feeding haven't been booked as it's a fun activity and great to get up close. be sure to take it slow some exhibits you have to take it chill to see some movement. also for shows get there well in advanced limited seats.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This is really an awesome place. It is not just about seeing animals and learn about their different species but the whole surroundings are just a pleasant place to walk around and you can engage in some teambuilding activities for children. My hubby and I just love spending a good 6hours at the zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It's been more than 15 years since I visited Singapore Zoo.  The last time I went was when I was 7-8 years old. Some exhibitions are under maintaince. There's many animals and it took us about 4 hours to walk and watch the animal shows. I hope people stop abusing animals. I only saw one White tiger and it's quite a sad scene. Their used to be more.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"World's top 3 zoo and it is still good during covid. But be ready for a hot tropical forest adventure and a lot of walking.  I walked 15km without me realise. The rhino is smelly. And if you see someone tap on the glass,  please shop him or her. Some tourist just crazy out there"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place to the take the family. Lots to do and see and friendly staff.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Despite the rain, the zoo continues to be a great place to relax and spend the day watching the animals. As it was raining, visiting the aquarium and panda exhibits were the best."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best zoo in the world. But too hot, should consider air conditioning whole park. All animal looks sleepy due to the hot weather."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"As a local, I have not been here since I was a child and this visit brought back many memories with my family! I have since visited some of South East Asia's conservatories and zoos and I must say KUDOS to WRS for such an amazing upkeep of the park and care for the welfare of the animals. They are in great condition and the park allowed many up-close animal encounters which were unforgettable :') Thank you for quenching my wanderlust and making me feel like I visited Africa, Australia and Asia all in one day! Highly recommend for tourists visiting Singapore to set aside a full day here! (so good that even locals should visit!!) Super worth it!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Spent the day at the Singapore Zoo with my family, and I would definitely recommend that you do too!
I shall not talk about the animals or layout, because that would spoil the fun/purpose of going there.

Activities wise, I oped for the Giraffe Feeding & White Rhinoceros Feeding that cost $5 each per pax. Remember to get your camera ready because these animals eat fast! And not to mention how up-close you get to be with them.

Food wise, we dined at the Inuka Cafe for breakfast, Ah Meng Kitchen for lunch and KFC for dinner. Pricing is no doubt higher than outside. Spending an average of $10-15 per pax for each meal.

Do remember to bring your own waterbottle to save the Earth and refill using their water dispenser around the zoo. Travel light and comfortably too!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Good for day outing
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Come here once in a while to relax. Unfortunately a couple of things are closed now.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Such a lovely place and very close to the nature. U will have a feeling not to come back from there. Staffs are so understanding and helping by nature. U can have a. Full day outing. Covid restrictions are also being followed smoothly. So it's not a pain for the visitors at all.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place. Major changes in view of COVID-19 regulations, such as online booking of tickets to shows instead of queue and walk in. Some places are also undergoing renovation. But overall still great!

Do bring your bottle as there are water coolers located in different areas within the zoo. For lunch be prepares to spend close to $10 for a proper meal. Snacks and drink dispensers are expensive and not worth the money imo. U can save by bringing your own sandwich in.

2 KFC outlets located within the zoo, prices are higher here compared to the public. KFC payment by cash only in both outlets.

Have a good one! :)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The animals have sufficient space to move around freely.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"My first time went to a zoo.
And it was a nice experience:)
The only thing to comment is their cafe inside the zoo closed too early."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"What can I say, we watch the animals, the animals watch us - a good experiment in inter species observation. Went on a cooling day and explored for six hours with a lunch break without being too fatigued, but if the lions broke loose and it really came down to it I’ll let them have the kids.

Fair word of advice: don’t do stupid TikTok videos in the enclosures if you’re born after the millennium and have that kind of inexplicable urges, at least come prepared with better video recording equipment."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Went to lumina. It was short and nice trip. Great for kids.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Many animals are healthy despite COVID19 situation,  however, if you wish to feed or interact with with animals, do do advance booking online as their feeding time have limited slots. Tram can be bought on the spot but no cash payment accepted."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Can be a little boring sometime as lack of activities at the light showcase in the zoo and line could be quite long. Overall it's not quite bad but could expect better
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"The zoo was a lot bigger than expected and had lots of animals (land, water, reptiles, birds etc.)

Hadd the opportunity to get up close with many animals that you cannot get to see in the wild.

Though the zoo was rather packed, the animals do not seem to be afraid of humans and are very casual around them."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place to see animas and learn more about them. It’s a bit crowded in December. Remember to bring shades, sun protection and water bottle!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Nice place to relax, get some exercise, and for learning abt animals. I really love this place and never get bored with the animals that I see. Water filler are available everywhere so make sure to bring your own bottle! Food on a pricey side :("
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"I felt discriminated by 1 staff over there.
Otherwise the rest was perfect."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Fantastic place. Bring water and a snack though, very hot. If you come early it's close to empty."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Same feeling as always visiting the Singapore Zoo 😊. Clean, neat park with variety of animals who goof around showing their antics. The animals are also in good condition. The Ah Meng cafe serves different types of food too and the price is affordable, not forgetting halal. The live show was too short due to covid 19 perhaps."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Welcome back! Open now after being closed during the circuit breaker. Still not at 100%, with many shows and eateries closed, and tram is not running. But all the animals are still there, and it's wonderful to see it back in any form. Still a great day out if you're an animal or nature lover."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Still an interesting place to visit after so many years but due to covid measures some of the performances are now cancelled. Also for some reasons there were full day sorties of nearby military choppers trainings so the whole afternoon when there, we can hear Chinnocks, pumas etc flying overhead. seemed like the animals also gotten use to it..."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had a good family time.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Wow what an amazing place, this must be the best zoo i have ever visitied. Animals have fantastic areas and everyone here is super friendly!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Good educational walk with children. Show them real and live animals to appreciate wildlife and nature.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Nice place.  Improved compared to years back.  Abundant of tree shades now.  Animals are usually paired up. Good environment to walk 10000 steps.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Nice place to spend whole day.. I will suggest to take tram ticket so that you can move without wasting energy in sunny day.. Reach early morning around 9:30 so that you can visit river safari and zoo same day. Cycle are not allowed inside, but you can take your food."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A great day out for everyone, no matter the age."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,not crowded at all due to the pandemic.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Definitely a must go place in Singapore if you want to get to know animals. There's also convenience strollers for kids as well.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Had a great time and covered the whole zoo in 4hrs. Good walk and greeted by many animals! 👍
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Visited zoo n safari. Can enjoy more if there is no rain. Better check weather before go. River safari is ok for any weather as it is sheltered.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,World class facility. Animals are checked regularly by vets and they provide them engagement activities to keep them in shape. Great for educational trips. Kids and adults will surely learn from the animals and zoo staff interaction.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo is world class. Definitely the best i have seen so far. But a bit sad to see that there are so few people there during this Covid period. Hopefully this is a time to rest, recharge and reinvent itself. Majulah Singapura."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"I generally not a big fan of zoo. This one it’s quite ok, although many exhibits were apparently empty, or have the animals hidden somewhere. People end up looking for an empty enclosed area. Although Singapore is usually very good in providing navigation in public places, the zoo is quite consuming and no printed map orrecommended routes provided. Perhaps that’s intentional to give people sense of adventure."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,What's else is there to say. This place is great.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"An amazing experience, had a lot of animals I haven't seen in zoos previously. A must visit for all wildlife enthusiasts."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the favorite places to spend a good sunny Sunday with kids.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The rope course worth spending a day at.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place for kids n adults to learn n have fun
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"1st visit after Circuit Breaker period. Not much to see but still a good day out for the family. Weather was kind to us. With the small kids and the crowd, i would still give it 4 stars as the  kids enjoyed it.
We didnt have the chance to watch the animal shows as it was 1st come to get the tickets."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore zoo is a world class quality service. I'm amused just by walking around and watching the animals. They provide plenty of shelter for you to make a stop. The Zoo also provides selections of goof and beverage for visitors to enjoy.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Best zoo with a kind of open concept where in animals are not kept in small enclosures like other Zoos. Worth visiting place.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"If you’re looking to take a trip down memory lane, this is the place for you. Everything is exactly as it was a decade ago. Basically it’s your average zoo with animals. Because of COVID, all the shows have reduced capacity and hence I’d advise to queue up at least 50 minutes in advance to secure a seat.

We were quite sad to have not had the time to enjoy all the sections as the animals were herded back and kept in their indoor enclosures at 5.30pm."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"An absolute must visit. This is possibly one of the best zoos in the world that I’ve seen. There is an incredibly large assortment of animals to see (some up close), plenty of quality shows, interactive encounters and more. Sounds like I’m writing an ad for the zoo but seriously - if you’re in Singapore and you’ve never been then you must give it a shot."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Never thought I would enjoy the zoo that much but I did. Just check out these few photos
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This attraction is definitely a must do whilst in Singapore. We only did the zoo (river and night safari are both two different ticketed attractions) and spent most of our day there. We got a grab here and it wasn't too expensive - you can get there by metro and bus but just seemed a taxi is much quicker and not much more expensive. The zoo is easy to get around and we managed to see pretty much everything on the map - there is some amazing scenery too and picnic places. It was epic! Free ranging orangutans swinging from tree to tree. A beautiful aviary and butterfly house. Every animal was so well cared for, and we loved the fact there were active breeding programs for endangered and critical species. We loved the signs all around about the illegal pet trade, as education in this part of the world is so vital. The complete lack of cages and fences was admirable and gave the sense of connection between the animals and us.The zoo also houses some rescue dogs and cats which host a show around 4pm but unfortunately we missed this. You can tell the keepers really care for the animals and the shows that we did see were amazing. A beautiful and ethical zoo, well worth seeing.
Best way to get there is taxi - ours was $19 from Clarke Quay for a family of 4."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I like the trip! wonderful place and always a good day or night around the animals!

I was visiting that place a few time during the day and i like it even more at night safari!

It is a very big place so you better follow the map!

It can get very hot during the day so be ready!

cheers!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Its the best zoo I've ever seen. Actually I don't like zoo because animals suffer there but in Singapore zoo animals feel good and they have more space.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore Zoo is a must go attraction place when you visit Singapore. Went there during phase 2 of Circuit Breaker. Need to book time slot for safety measures. Enjoy with less crowded environment.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Awesome place with excellent higene being maintained. Very clean place. Clean toilet for man, woman and kids. Good food to eat. You can also view some shows. Download the show time from website. The food inside restaurant is very good and nice in taste. You can hire pram as well as can refill water from water station. Also has juice centers. You can buy in 3 dollars approx. Must visit place if you come at Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best zoo!
Well organized, wide variety of animals, animals look and feel happy. Excellent place to spend an afternoon. A good workout too!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place to visit with full of entertainment.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Singapore Zoo is one of the most amazing zoos i have ever been to i loved how you had close interaction with all the animlas and especially in the butterfly enclosure would love to re visit this zoo in the future. During this COVID situation, i am very impressed with how they control the crowds and ensure safe distancing."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Top zoo, amazing experience with wildlife and nature. Learn a great deal about conservation and preserving the fragile world we live in."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Always a good choice for family time. Kids still love going there even now they are at higher primary.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great visit to zoo. Currently being upgraded so lots of work going on but still a good day out.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,1,"Not many animals as it was 20+ years ago.
Animals are not as lively.
Even though opening hours is from 8:30am, you don't see the animals in their enclosure. Animals start coming out around 10:00am.
The only good thing is the pavilion overlooking Seletar Reservoir which offers great view and peace for picnic."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The otters were absolutely the best of the trip!
The ticket pricing is of great value and the food at the cafe was surprisingly good. Not cheap but not overly charged."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Though some shows and exhibition not available during the pandemic period, but it is still a nice place to hang out for nature lovers. Please consider to purchase ticket online to enjoy discounted price!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Don't go with plans to watch shows as Q is vy vy long but not all can go in due to safe distancing. Be very careful with your food. Even if they are packed in ziplocks. We were ambushed by monkeys as we were leaving the zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Despite the safe distancing measures, still a pleasant and enjoyable trip to the zoo. Shows were operating on limited capacity but the booking system worked well. Good job Singapore Zoo team. :)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"What a fantastic zoo, we started by having breakfast with The Orangutans, which was an amazing experience, and one we will not forget. The animals are so well cared for, and the interactive sessions very good.... we were even allowed to feed the elephants..... another memory. There is a lot of renovation going on to enhance the experience even more, but this does not detract from your visit..... excellent"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Lovely place to visit in Singapore.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A very big zoo with many interesting animals. Very kids friendly, and quite an organised zoo. Be prepared for a long walk if you are not taking the tram"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best. Enjoy So Much. Awesome view. Stunning. Nature 100% Good . Amazing Wild Animals. Etc. Theres a Restaurant called "" Ah Meng Restaurant ""."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"This zoo is the benchmark is what zoos should deliver in terms of education, fun and something that is unique that leaves you wanting to come back. The family absolutely had an amazing time. We will def be back to try out some of the other spectacles."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best places that I've been to.  Be prepared to spend most of the day here.  Lots of walking and may places that provide an escape with some well needed aircon.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best Zoo I have ever been to.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Nature and animal lovers. It's a treat for you to watch animals in their natural habitat.
Please enjoy every bit of it.
Don't go in peak season. See the month where it is less crowded and so you can enjoy tram rides and view nature and animals. As it is a huge area to just walk by."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"favorite chill and hangout place. the food, drinks and staff are all great. the service is nice and if you frequent there enough, they will even remember your order. really love this place where I can work with their free wifi, chill and have some dinner some times"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing Zoo with a huge variety of wildlife - one of the top 3 zoos in the world. For a day, we've managed to visit the zoo without the 2 additional attractions - river and night safari. The staff really take care of and respect the animals - everywhere is super clean and there is no bad smell. You can buy tickets directly through their website if you want to save some money. The best time to visit is in the morning or in the evening. I definitely recommend this place to everyone who travels to Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I went before the Phase 2 HA was announced. Definitely one of my favourite attractions in Singapore, and it was nice to go when there were much fewer people than usual, so it was very relaxing to walk around for several hours! While of course some areas must be closed for obvious reasons (eg the elephant show and the petting zoo), the last time I came here they were really fun anyway and I really enjoyed my time here."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,king cobra is my best love。。。。
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Some parts are closed for improvement works. Overall nice to visit and the crowd control is done well.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Singapore Zoo is a gem that is worth a visit again and again. And they’ve made it easy to get to. I prebooked my tickets online, took a train to Khatib MRT, and there was a Mandai Express which is about $1 (exit A at the station) and it’ll drop you right at the Zoo. The shows were entertaining, informative and the little gem is the butterfly walk through which we thoroughly enjoyed. A well spent day!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoos I've visited. Lots of animals from around the world to see, animal shows and even a petting zoo. Seems easy to get there, shuttle bus to get there from the train station."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Beautiful, Clean and awesome! I like the orang utans climbing freely around and pee on tourists hahaha"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Online booking for feeding, sold out very quickly. The P2HA affected their ops alot."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"food is god awful, don't recommend the forest lodge. portions too small and wait time exceedingly long. kfc also super stale. maybe only ah meng is edible, wouldn't know.

otherwise perfect. khatib-mandai bus is punctual every 20 minutes so can plan your entry and exit around that reliably. with covid the shows fill up about 30 minutes before start time."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,a good place for a family fun time.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very nice place 😍
There were all kinds of animals in that park and I enjoyed seeing it"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It's amazing...none of the animals are entirely native to the country but they have painstakingly sourced and provided for these beautiful creatures. The zoo caters to all age groups and has a wonderful variety of animals. The place is perfectly organised and beautifully laid out to handle crowds well. Each attraction is meticulously designed and the spectators are in for a visual treat at this place.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It a splendid adventure
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,My Little Girl Enjoy Very Much. All Awesome
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great zoo, lots of animals and good exhibitions. Can be combined with a visit to eg the River Safari in one day as they are next to eachother"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,One day is not enough 😌..need more time to visit all animals area.anyway I enjoyed lot..if you want to go use mandai express from khatib station .it's very near.. reduce travelling time
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A very enjoyable morning with lesser crowds, so we really get to be in nature! Hopefully the zoo will consider implementing some form of crowd control even during non pandemic times."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Set aside an entire day for the visit. Do check out the timing for the shows and plan your route around the zoo to see all the animals. Be early for the shows as the seats fill up fast. With Covid measures in place, each show is limited to a smaller group of audience. Water play and some children attractions are closed.

Washrooms and snacks counter are plenty around the entire zoo. You can bring your own snacks to picnic."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore zoo is wonderful place to see lovely animals in a cloudy or drizzling day. Sometimes we can encounter a monkey outside a cage.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Huge zoo. A lot of animals. The conditions seem to be not very stressful for the animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Brought my son for his first time visit to the zoo. As of 4th dec, KFC was under reno and there were not much Halal food options. If I'm not wrong I only saw Ah Meng Bistro being Halal-certified. Recommended to bring your own foods and drinks! And carpark parking from 1030am to 430pm was $10 - so be prepared to top up your cashcard. 😂 And please wear comfortable clothes and comfortable/sport shoes as you'll be doing a bit of walking."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Theres some construction noise going on, but otherwise without the usual crowd, its a pleasant place to visit. Went with partner and with a tour guide as well to explain some of the zoo concepts. Take note no dining in, so you might have to eat at some random bench."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We come here with my children at least 10 times a year, and there is still so much to see. Highly recommend!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A great escape in this COVID time, although lots of maintenance works which prevent you to see the full potential that the zoo has to offer. Overall a nice afternoon, spent in four continents, with crazy creatures which can be seen from veryyyy close. Something too close and a bit scary if you don't like bats like me..."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,We have a 3 yrs old and we love visiting the Singapore Zoo every few weekends. It has so many things for kids to watch n learn from. The kids are with a little barn and water slides is awesome.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,I when to the zoo with 6 of my friends that was really fun N happy
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,An interesting place where you can observe many animals up close.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"I quite like the atmosphere created by the park at the Singapore Zoo. Over the years that I've been visiting the Zoo, I can see efforts put into enhancing the park. The only down side for me is that there isn't much to see in term of animals other than the usual. I guess it's really time for a major overhaul. Comparatively, River Safari has much more to see and its definitely more worthwhile to spend a day there."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Some animals/feature were not avalible when i visited. Maybe because of the corona situation. But still a great place to visit.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This is a place everyone must go and see. There are several animals are living freely. Most of animals are not caged and they have been given to live freely open areas.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Amazing zoo with a huge variety of wildlife. The enclosures are designed with natural barriers. So there are minimal cages and bars. Please be aware the place is huge so there is a lot of walking involved. Therefore we would highly suggest paying the $5 for unlimited buggy rides through the park. Would definitely give yourself a good 3-4 hours to walk through and see everything.  A must visit for those who love any wildlife.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Nice place. Its not crowded as its weekday
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Why is the pick up point so far from the entrance? Anyway, my family and I had a great time at the zoo even though it was raining on the day we went :)"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A bit crowded when I went here, but there were a lot of mosquitoes. WiFi is good but sometimes disconnect when going into some areas"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Always fun and interesting to visit Singapore zoo, the place is clean, kids and elderly friendly too"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,A visit to singapore zoo.🙂🙂🙂
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This is the best Zoo I have ever seen.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"BEST zoo in the world. Service is EXCELLENT, anywhere & everywhere. Variety of animals is a broad spectrum, from A to Z. Ambience is clean, orderly, shady & relaxing. Kudos to all staff for taking good care of all the animals & also in upkeeping superb maintenance. Hats off to Singapore Zoo, the BEST in the world."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We visit the Singapore Zoo a few times a year. It's a great place to go with children. This time round, the kids enjoyed the Mammoth Adventure back in time.  They had fun with the games, crafts and photo-taking with the prehistoric animals.
If it's your first trip to the Singapore Zoo, don't miss the shows and animal feedings. And have breakfast with the Orangutans."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"So different after so many years! Different in a good way.

Come here if you want to check out variety of animals and animals up close."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very well managed and organized. Good mix to keep kids and adults equally interested. Logistics and walk around are well organised. Food options are not many especially if you happen to be vegetarian. Though you are allowed to carry your food is interested. Good mix of animals and flora n fauna. Worth couple of visits minimum. If interested in finer details, may need more visits"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing!
Best zoo I've ever been too, spent the day at the zoo then went too river safari and onto the night zoo. Highly recommend them all... cant wait to go back one day and see the new developments that were taking place while we were there... too add another 2(I think) experiences too the collection. (Zoo is stand alone from other places I've mentioned but multi tickets are available for visiting multiple places) doing all in 1 day makes  for A massive day but I wouldn't be able to pick 1 id happily give up going too, all were amazing."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo is a must see attraction. All 3 attractions are worth seeing. It will take a whole day, but it’s fascinating to see animals and learn about them. Singapore Zoo is a beautiful home to animals that are endangered.
I definitely recommend this place to everyone who travels to Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had an enjoyable time with my husband and son at the zoo after not visiting it for the longest time. Social distancing was inconvenient but necessary. Will come back again for the River Safari soon!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"It is a fantabulous place. We went around 1pm and spent next 6 hours traversing through the zoo.

I would suggest follow the map. The shows bookings happen 90minutes before. You need to be in the vicinity of the booking area to do the booking. I loved my time here!

It is amazing place! The orangutan are my favourites! I could sit and observe the animals all the time."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,A highly new experience still listening that from soul. Enjoyed a lot
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"The no of Animals seems to have decreased, no sure if this is due to COVID restrictions. The Animals seems sad/ depressed. The ticket price is expensive considering that it does not include any rides."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Awesome family time
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Went there on a rainy day so couldnt really explore much of the place. Mgmt could consider making the tram ride during rainy days so visitors can make the best out of the unfortunate weather.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Wonderful place, had many animals including penguins and pandas! Loved how fat and chubby the pandas were!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Love the zoo. Gone there countless times but still goes there. Great time to visit the zoo now. There are no crowds now. The animals are less stress with fewer human ogling them. I have never seen this happy before in my so many years visiting the zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best zoo, must visit place in Singapore. Well organised and maintained zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Because of the limited audience allowed for the live performances, my family , including the kids were able to catch one show only and that was a 30mins queue as well.

Some seniors like me prefer hard copy of the map for better search. The digital map on hp is difficult to locate the places/ animals  we like to see.
Please reinstate the hard copies or have some reserves for seniors or those for some reasons need it."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Good zoo, no more bad stuff happening like elephant rides. Looks like it's going through a bit of a renovation in places. Due to Covid some of the exhibits aren't on, but still a full fun packed day."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"What a great experience! I always consider the most important part of a zoo to be how it takes care of its animals, and this one seems to do an excellent job. The zoo has lots of open areas (Singapore zoo is cage free), and the enclosures for the large animals all seem adequately sized. Animals live in the area and are not forced to come out so everyone can see them, so you might not see all the animals when you come visit. A wide array of animals can be found here along with lots of events, feeding times to watch (and some to participate in for a fee), and lots of information. The animals are treated with respect and the events are educational, focusing on conversation and environment in addition to entertainment.

There were very few people when I visited, so I never felt crowded. There may have been 50-100 people, but the zoo is so large that there are were only a few people in my vicinity at all times. I felt like the price was fair considering the level of treatments the animals get. Definitely a place I would regularly visit if I lived in Singapore. Great experience."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Loving it! Went there after the rain and not much crowd. It was awesome probably bcos i enjoy taking pictures (:
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Best zoo in the world. A must visit place in Singapore.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of my favorite places in Singapore.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One bright spot during the Covid-19 outbreak is the lack of crowding at popular attractions. We booked a mid-afternoon start time (caution: the Zoo closes at 6 p.m.) and risked getting rained on. On a Tuesday afternoon, we never had more than five people within view (sole exception: Reptile House). The animals were less spooky, with the highlight being two giraffes which walked up to within five meters of my son. It was a great viewing experience.

Not everything is great, however. The tram doesn't run, so wear comfortable shoes. Almost all F&B outlets are closed, too, so drink water before you enter (or carry it with you). About 5% of the exhibits/animals enclosures are under renovation and the animals aren't on display. But none of those drawbacks detracted from an overall great experience"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Our homegrown zoo. Hadn't been here in years, but it feels like there are fewer exhibits now? Hope it gets better once the pandemic is over!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Learning to enjoy singapore more now that we cant travel! Love the Singapore zoo as much as i used to love it as a kid :)
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Always an enjoyable place to go to to see animals in as natural and comfortable an environment as possible. Very informative tram rides and ample interesting activities and feeding sessions for all ages! Love the turtle feeding team! Very friendly and informative! 👍🏻
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the Best!!! Had a really great time at Singapore Zoo. A perfect day out for children as well adult. 🤩
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Nice.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This place is beautiful ❤
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Love the open concept.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,scan the QR codes around the zoo and sign up for animal buddy to exchange for ice cream! zoo was not crowded due to crowd control.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"If I could give it 10 stars I would, it's that good. This is the best zoo I have ever been to. Its such a great place and more than worth your money to visit. You will not be disappointed.
The animals have loads of space and look really happy and engaged. Great day out."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,With crowd control now it's even more enjoyable for the little ones. Nice 👍
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Best zoo in the world and also better than my home country. Clean and well behave animals. The staff here are also happy working. I love this place. Will come back here with my family again.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It's the best zoo I've been to , the animals are given a big area to roam about. It's a great place to digital photography. I wouldn't advise using  film cameras with flash as the flash may stun the animals. There are many shows that audience interactive and outside the kids area sometimes friendly animals are brought out for the children to pet. The best days for photography are hot days when you sweat because the colours are really vibrant"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"We arrived late in the day, just before 4pm and were helpfully told before purchasing our tickets that they recommend 3-4 hours to get through (and it closes at 6pm). We made our way through seeing everything we wanted in enough time though. Easy enough to navigate and the displays were lovely - the animals seam very much at home in their surroundings and were usually at least in pairs."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The best thing I like the most is the way they describe about the animals. The animal shows are also entertaining.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Awesome place for the family! Bring your own water bottles. Drinks and food inside are pricey. Its understandable. All in all, would definitely revisit. 👍💪 Good job to the staff here for keeping the animals healthy and the place clean."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,There are a lot of animals and birds in the Singapore Zoo. Various shows are very entertaining and are a must. The cafe here serves Indian food also.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Great zoo with large outdoor areas for the animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Best zoo in the region for sure. Still is even with the pandemic and restrictions. There are still F&B available and planning is needed as we had to pre book our time slot to arrive so there is crowd control and social distancing.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoo in the world. Plenty of attractions and adjacent to river safari and night safari area.

Definitely a must see when visiting singapore.

World class facilities inside.

Public bus connectivity can be limited and catching a taxi can be time consuming during busy hours."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best zoo I have ever been to, the animal were well taken care off. The staff was great and friendly. The food choices were nice and there were many options. Will definitely go back after the pandemic."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,As a child I would go every year with my family and I never got bored of it. I'm always fascinated by it everyday. Those with families especially kids will definitely enjoy the zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I've been to the zoo in many countries, this is the most comfortable and the most convenient one to take kids. They have the zoo planned so well, that nobody will get lost in it and it's so clean and all the animals look super happy which feels really great. I'm totally loving it and I will definitely come back 😍"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place for family outing during the COV period. Get to walk exercise and the kids get to see their favourite animals
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the most well-maintained zoos I’ve ever visited, especially in this region..."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Full of amenities. My family and I enjoyed our trip to the zoo! Best zoo in the entire universe! Must visit in your lifetime!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Though not as much to see as compare to previously, but with lesser crowd it's more enjoyable to stroll through the park. Been trying to call the hotline to make enquiries, as well as sending emails, totally no replies or answers, hope it's only temporarily during this period."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Truly a wonderful trip. The only downside, The lions and leopards are often sleeping apart from that the other attractions especially the white tiger is amazing top notch quality but not much food options around to chow on food"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We went for the private buggy tour.  $300 for six people.  It was worth every penny.  Our guides were Gen and Bridgette.  They were wonderful,  knowledgeable and engaging. Kudos for such a great crew.  My kids loved the animal feeding and behind the scenes toursl. Would recommend"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Even with the covid situation it is still a pleasant visit
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Highly recommended. Get up close with animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had a wonderful experience with my 2 year old and 7 years old granddaughters. The arrangements were safe and fool proof in the present covid scenario. If the weather was better could have spent double of the three hours we spebt
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Coming from a non tropical region, one thing that astounded me was the variety of flora and fauna you see in this zoo.

One needs a good day of exploring this collection of animals. Tickets are easy to purchase at the counter and the paths are easy to follow. If the heat is a bit too much for you, there is a little golf cart type bus taking tourists and you can buy passes for it anywhere.

There are feeding times for the primates and elephants,etc so if you keep the map with you you can make sure to get to them in time.

There are vending machines that provide fresh squeezed orange juice which is an exciting thing to see by itself.

The butterfly and bird part of the zoo is a must see. Unfortunately a lot of the predators might be lazy if the weather is too hot.

Public Transportation wise it’s a bit tricky as the buses here are in a closed loop till the MRT and the tickets are sold at the Zoo counter. We struggled a bit to understand where to buy the tickets initially. Lots of cabs available here though.

Install the Grab application and get a tourist pass for local transportation for an easier time in Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It is a great place for people of all ages. Very beautifully laid out. Amazingly a wide collection of animals and a nice walk around the zoo. There is provision for tram train rides around the zoo. There are certain specific shows at certain times of the day. You may visit the website to check those timings and plan your outing there. The monkeys seems to be roaming and swinging freely on the trees. The reptile section is quite interesting. For a thorough look and leisure outing, it will take half a day or so. There is a food court inside the zoo for a quick bite and to refresh yourself. There are feeding time for birds and animals for a certain fee at specific times, so it is good to check the website. The baboons have a huge area and they seem to have a kingdom of their own. It is really worth visiting and having an outing there with family and friends."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo was voted top three best zoos in the world but first in Asia. As a Singaporean, I'm super damn proud. It us constantly changing and renovating parts of the zoo (which does not cause any inconvenience at all) to make it a more exciting and exclusive place to be. I highly recommend the splash show because there  are so many tricks to see if you enjoy animals. This zoo is truly the best zoo I have been to."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Cute and fun❤️
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Fantastic Zoo, I’m not a person who normally goes to Zoo’s but I know how popular this one is in Singapore. Really well laid out and thought through so much to see and you can do the Night Safari, River Safari can easily spend the full day there. We had access to the Lumina event on in the evening at that time as well great day out and if going by bus catch it to the nearest MRT no issues what so ever. July 2019"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the world's greatest zoos! The Orangutan enclosure is fantastic! The orangutans can actually climb ropes and exit the main enclosure! The baboons are great fun to watch, especially the babies. We loved the bird enclosure where you could walk right beside the lemurs! We had a great time there!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I have been to zoos in DC, Fort Worth and Shanghai, and Singapore zoo is easily the best zoo that I have been to. I get to be super close with lots of animals and it seems they have designed very nicely so that most animals really like to appear in our views.
The weather in Singapore is not quite good and we ended up having to wait in a shelter for a while when it suddenly started raining. I'd recommend that you leave plenty of time for the zoo, because 1. There is a LOT to see and 2. It might suddenly start raining..."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,During COVID 19 Period. Need booking the time slots. Very good place to visit.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Amazing place.... they have moving dragon statutes and other fun animals. The crocodiles are big and the squirrels that roam around are not too wild to take a pic. The beavers are so playful and the park is clean and great in adventure... the splash show is superb...
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Been in love with Singapore Zoo since I first stepped into it. The cageless style zoo was really a new concept back in the 2000s.

Recently, I went back with the kids and was pleasantly surprised on how well the zoo managed the crowd during the pandemic so that everyone could have fun while being socially distanced.

First off, this holiday, they introduced special Mickey/Minnie event for kids. Complete the mission and exchange the card with an animal keychain. Q-ing for the card was fast, many zoo employees were around to facilitate the q, tapes on the floor to denote the safe distance between patrons and definitely everyone's wearing masks.

To reduce crowding, visitors have to book their visiting slot in advance. When we entered the kids' area, we also found out that feeding session for the goats were also to be booked online. Too bad we didn't research well before going. But the kids weren't disappointed because they also could join other activity in the area (it was floating bubble activity when we went).

Expect long q for shows (Rainforest show) since there's limit on number of people allowed. We decided to skip on the shows since the kids wouldn't want to stand and wait around under the sun.

If you would like to save time and place (and to avoid crowd in the eateries), pack your own lunch and eat at open areas and benches spread around the zoo. While everyone was masked and all, we would rather avoid crowding by packing our own lunch.

Overall we had fun at the zoo. Just ensure you have umbrella ready since it has been rainy recently. Have fun!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I think Singapore zoo is one of the best zoo in South East Asia. The place is huge, clean and comfortable. You can spend half of your day here. They have great animal collection.The last time I visited this place, they were in the middle of construction project to expand the zoo. Can't wait to see the expansion. I put this place as one of my must visit destination when in Singapore with the kids."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The most beautiful zoo I've ever been to! Well maintained animal keeping areas with plenty of feed time interactions and loads of amenities around such as juice machines,ice cream machines and also food carts to satisfy your munchies! Elephant area was my absolute favourite. You could see these curious and magnificent creatures at play and how they use their brains to get food out from little holes with their trunks amazed me. It's a sort of sensory play that develops problem solving and also promote active lifestyle for these beasts. The animal that made me most sad was big sumatran orangutan. It felt so human like that I didn't feel right for it to be kept in a glass cage with little but nothing to do. Very depressing. Other than that,beautiful attraction for families."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Kids liked it, but I think it's overrated. The fenceless concept is very beautiful and innovative. Increasing awareness about the global warming and promoting less plastics is marketed in a great way, kids understand and adopt those concepts, a real big value. The animal shows and feeding sessions could be enhanced."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Really great and many animals so you have to come twice to view all animals but good.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Cool zoo! Great variety of beautiful animals in very nice habitats... be sure to check out all the different parks... it’s worth the money
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very nice and good walk! At the same time, see live animals to appreciate them more, resto to eat."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Lots of wild animals you will see and this zoo is really big than usual one i visit.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A nice place to spend the day with your family. Many different Animals to learn about and take pictures,  bus tour was interesting"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Beautiful zoo. Most zoo's are depressing and make you regret needing to see the animals; this zoo really seems to try it's best to make a habitual and enjoyable environment for its inhabitants. They are continually upgrading the exhibits and making a unique experience for the guests. Hands down one of the best zoo's in the world
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Awesome as always ever since my childhood days!!!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Very nice and amazing place. Its all about nature and wild life. If you go in, you get to see lots of wild animals of different varieties, such a treat to your eyes. Quite a large place also, need half day or more to explore all of its beauty. It also has a few shows in place, which are really good and interesting. Enjoyable place for all"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Super clean , large spaces for animals to live in. The Sumatran orangutan and Simba were the highlight"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very clean environment. The chimps feeding is extremely fun to watch. There are monkeys roaming around the place too. Do time your visit with the show times to make the best of your trip. Bring your own water bottle as drinks can be quite expensive in the zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Nice weekend walk and great facility with abundance animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had a great day st the Singapore zoo. Started with breakfast with the Orangutans.  We ate first and then table by table were taken to have photos taken with the Orangutans.  They had their photographer who also took plenty of photos with your camers/phones as well. Had a hop on hop off bus that that cost SD 5 each. Animals were well cared for and grounds impeccably kept. Worth while seeing
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This is very cool and big zoo!
I like him. Best zoo in the world."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place to visit with kids. Well maintained and full of trees and greenery. Kids and adults both enjoy seeing the animals and animal shows.  Giraffe, white tiger, hippos, rihnos, elephants, monkeys of various breed. Just awesome experience. We took the tram ride also, which in itself was a great experience. Never miss the opportunity to visit Singapore Zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Rainforest Lumina was excellent!!!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,My favorite place since I was a child! Best time to  visit now since the park has restricted the number of people entering.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"The signages are not well organised, not easy to nevigate. Luckily the service staffs are friendly and helpful."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore Zoo gives us new experience everytime we visit
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Wonderful place to like you and your family get close and personal with some of the most beautiful animals of the animal kingdom
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Some part under construction.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very nice place. Can’t help that it’s Super hot and humid since it’s based in Singapore. But the kids absolutely loved this place!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,The place is great for family to chilli and visit some cute animals. Food prices is reasonable too. Some attraction too many people. Pick your time
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place for the kids
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Absolutely loved. My first time visit of human artificial well managed rainforest. But it's look like natural rainforest. The best zoo you can ever visit. The whole place is rainforest. There is a free tram rides. We can travel by tram or walking by ourselves it's on choice. But I suggest tram is a good choice to see all animal with short time. But it's little bit hard to catch up a tram because of the people crowd. Very rare animal with natural beauty. There are monkeys everywhere. I also enjoyed night safari. There is also a meeting conducted by zoo authority with animal shows thats really awesome experience and That was a great experience.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Kudos to the Singapore Zoo management to the excellent social distancing arrangements and smooth management of the crowd during Covid period.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Seems smaller n lesser animals compared to years back.love the feeding programmes tho
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Home to several of the most exotic species on the planet. Rated amongst the top 3 zoo's in the world. Provides a breathtaking opportunity to view animals in their natural habitat. At Singapore zoo, you don't visit nature. Nature visits you!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Nice place to visit with your kids. They will really appreciate. Even me as a adult i like the ambiance.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very nice zoo..while entering you can get the map of the zoo..your kids will enjoy..wear proper shoes for walk..water refills are available everywhere..wash rooms are neat and clean..decent restaurants are also available inside.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great zoo
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Nice Zoo. I have enjoyed that. Some routes were closed so I was not able to see all, however, still worth to visit. I appreciated the free water fountains where you can refill your bottle."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,A spot of tranquility in the Singapore Zoo :) Not many visitors seek out this lovely vista 🧡💚
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"OMG! That was my reaction at the Singapore zoo. Watching wildlife at such a close distance and while they are in their natural habitat, was such a beautiful experience. You can look forward to watching crocodiles, lions, giraffes, zebras, ostriches... But the panda! It's so cute. It stole my heart.
There is a tram that is constantly moving around in the zoo. For senior citizens and children who do not wish to or can't walk long distances, please use the tram service to go from one habitat to the other.
Do not miss the complimentary boat ride. I would suggest you do that by the end of the day to enjoy the evening views and the breeze."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoos I visited in my life. It is definitely worth doing the night safari.
The food is good for a zoo, not the best food you could have in Singapore but really good for the circumstances.

Lumina is also great so I advice to go and see the zoo at night time. There is also a night show with animals."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Use the trams if you are travelling with kids or elders. The zoo is much more interesting than river safari so plan to go to the zoo first then the river safari just in case you run out of time you would have covered the good stuff.
For kids you can hire a stroller but we did not need one because we were using the trams a lot."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It rained heavily during the day of visit. Was able to link from carpark all the way to the entrance. Some parts of the part are sheltered too.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Staff at the zoo are friendly and approachable
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Loved this zoo. Loads of different animals to get up close and personal with. Also done the breakfast with orangutans which was an unbelievable experience.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very awesome zoo , best zoo I have visited till now with given real environment for environment without any cage.

Best Part is white lion, zebra & giraffe

Really loved it"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Loved Singapore zoo! We did the Night Safari as well. The tram ride and the walking trails were lovely. The animals seemed well looked after and the entire place clean and organized. We had a tonne of fun as a family. Worth another visit as well!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A great attraction, family friendly, perfect for a picnic! Remember to bring an umbrella just in case of a sudden downpour, and visit the Fragile Forest! So many butterflies! The zookeepers are knowledgeable and funny, would come here again for celebrations and picnics!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Experience was a little slow. Some of the animals seemed missing from their place. It was surprisingly croweded on Saturdays. Shows are good specially the splash. Strongly recommended, make sure to book their slot 90 mins before, they have a QR code next to the arena. Take a water bottle and some food/candy with you. I was at 14K step count."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I have been to the Singapore Zoo everytime I visit Singapore and its always such a great experience! They take such good care of the animals and their enclosures. They have great Animal shows too , educating and encouraging conservation. Make sure that you go back for the Night Safari too!!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The animals were well taken care of. There were also a variety of animals to see and varies from mammals to insects and many more. Worth the adventure
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This place is amazing and worthy to be a member here.juz love this zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best Zoos in the world. Animals' origins are more of Asia types. The premises was built like a tropical and foresty huge park/garden to make the creatures feel more at home. They are also observed to be more lively and active compared to zoos in some of the other countries.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very beautiful place to visit. Elephant and splash show are must see shows. Internal tram is also available. Indian food is also available exactly opposite to tram station 1. The food at this stall is the best i tasted in Singapore.Tram station 3 has the most of the animals placed.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This is a solid 5 stars. Well worth a 5-6 hour visit. Great enclosures, interesting animals and well presented.

In my opinion the best thing to see in Singapore.

A few tips:

Taxi from downtown is about $19- 25 (Singapore dollars).  Well worth it. Don’t bother with shuttles or transit.

Go mid morning ( before lunch) so you have enough time to see it and not rush.

Don’t purchase the tram ticket.  Walk. It’s much better and $5 cheaper.

Do bring an umbrella if there is rain in the forecast.

Enjoy!!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Lumina has nice light displays. Good for kids and kidults
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place for experiencing wild life. No cages only glass barriers for animals. Best of all they have air conditioned cabins made for people to sit and relax along with animals in view
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,It's was so good
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The one and only zoo in Singapore
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"My family and I always enjoy a day at Singapore Zoo. There's just heaps of things to do. There are animal shows, playgrounds, carousel, animal interaction like pony rides, feeding opportunities, gift shops for souvenirs and quite a few number of dining choices too. They have a massive collection of animals, birds, insects species, successful conservation for animals being threatened with extinction like white rhinos and hippos. Lovely way to enjoy a day with family with small and not so small children. One thing to remember though is to keep your water bottle close to you as a typical day is hot and humid."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Amazing Experience
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The absence of cage and well designed moat around most enclosures allows us with unobstructed view of the animals in their natural habitat, albeit man made. The animals looked comfortable and well fed. The grouping of the enclosure and the pathway leading to them make for a joyful trip of discovering. The wordings are just sufficient to introduce the important points about the animals. Staff are helpful and happy. A great 3 hours trip. In terms of refreshment, lots of drink vending machine can be found with small food kiosk and a food court. Oh, there’s also a KFC at the end of the zoo before you turned back and head to the entrance/exit."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,My friend and I personally enjoyed the whole experience at the zoo. I will say I found the map a little confusing to navigate as items weren't placed exactly on the map. I would still come again just to see the orangutans. They were a lot bigger in person and could enjoy swinging from tree to tree.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,don't miss river safari and meet panda
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,The place is big. The people who runit are not big hearted. The place has filthy toilets. We hated to see animals enclosed in tiny areas whereas the commercial activities are given ample spaces.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Well maintained and tastefully done.. We were at a tight schedule, hence covered Zoo, River safari and Night safari on the same day.. This could be tiring however if you hit zoo early in the morning, one can cover all these 3 on the same day.."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore zoo is fairly unique in its rainforest setting with matching climate.  Orangutans are definitely the stars of the show, hot tip move up the ramp to the right ... and look up... I mean right up.  The zoo needs at least half a day, longer with kids and their are trams to save on the walking.  Reasonable food at reasonable prices also sets Singapore zoo apart from some other zoos"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A true world class zoo. Active, well cared for animals and got to see a lot up close! Bougie bathrooms!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Must visit zoo if you love to see different animals. They have a tram also to cover the main spots. The tram has 4 stops. Get down and uncover the zoo.
There are feeding sessions for different animals where you can directly feed them for 5 Singapore Dollar. Be sure of checking the feeding times for your favourites before going. They also have some shows by animals at fixed timings."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"The train tram was upgraded, more comfortable. It was quite crowded as teachers brought students to the zoo too. Many food restaurants at each point of station. The zoo was well kept."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had an amazing fun-filled day with the fam. A must visit If you have kids. Everything was well maintained and very informative.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Still one of the best places to bring your kids to explore and get close to the numerous animals.

The park is well connected, and you can opt to take the tram to get to different parts of the park."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"A perfect place for Animal lovers, one of the best zoos in the world, animals are from all over the world adults and kids will enjoy n have lot of fun, specially night safari and river safari is the most attractive and amazing. Zoo is well organised and neatly maintained with all amenities and don’t miss elephant show, finally its a great place 👍🏻👌🏻😊"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Great place for kids to have a look at the wildlife. Liked the way it is segregated between different forest types. Staff are very helpful and they should introduce more of electric vehicles than the ones which emit emission.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A well preserved animal sanctuary with open spaces for the animals to roam around like their natural habitat. Well mannered, helpful and welcoming crew all over the place to make your visit easier. Their are animal feeding shows all around the hours from 10am to 5 pm."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"There’s a lot of construction ongoing so the entry/exit experience aren’t ideal. The grounds are nice and kids love the tram and other attractions. Food is okay and not totally overpriced, although the system for ordering/pickup are rather manufacturing line reminiscent. I wish they would offer the stroller and trolley ($18) rentals for less."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing place to be! For kids and adults, it's full of fun and adventure. You can go there as early as 9:15am and it closes at 7pm. We hopped on and off the tram and covered almost all of the zoo by stopping at the 4 tram stations. The thing we loved most was watching the giraffe from so close as they ran and ate in front of us, also the seal at the splash show did an amazing show! Our 2 year old daughter was thrilled looking at all the animals and birds she had seen in books until now. We saw pelicans, spider monkeys, giraffe, elephants, rhinos, zebra ..the list is long. I will highly recommend to take your kids as it's such a visual treat for them and a great learning experience too. Dont forget your sun hats, shades and keep hydrated. Enjoy"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Not so extensive exhibit of animals in their "" natural surroundings"".... There are shows portrayed twice a day...do check out the zoo's website for exact times...

There are 2 different sections namely the Night Safari if you are into nocturnal animals and the River Safari whereby the main attractions are the giant pandas... Both requires additional entrance fees

Because of the Night Safari and River Safari being seperate entities, the exhibits in the main zoo may not be as elaborate as expected...other Asian zoos such as the one in Taipei may have relatively more exhibits which are as well maintained and taken care off..."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It was one of best zoos I have ever been to . But again avoid summer times . It tends to become too humid and hot . Water filling areas are very less .carry your water and definitely get a pull trolley  to carry water from outside . Giraffe is brilliant too
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Brilliant collection of animals. The zoo is quite large & is really difficult to cover completely by foot. It is better to take tickets for tram. Initially do a recce on tram to identify animals you want to see so that you don’t waste energy walking in wrong direction. Carry water as we will get thirsty quickly in the hot & humid climate of Singapore. Best technique is to start from one corner of the park & to cover places in a anti clockwise/ clockwise pattern so that you don’t miss any of the animals
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,An awesome zoo with plenty to see and do. Very great job making the exhibits feel cage free. Would recommend 2-2:30 hours if walking.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,I am touring from different zoos and I can say this is one of the cleanest and  organised zoo I've been to. Staffs are very caring to the animals as well.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It's really nice with very happy and healthy animals! My family had lots of fun!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,It's a good place for children. Nice Greenery.  One can find few animals on trees also. If u have time then u can easily cover entire zoo on your feet. If time is limited then go for tram rides. There are few shows. Keep watch on their timings. The shows are generally around 15 min to 30 min. Overall zoo is not very big. But it is well maintained.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Clean place. Good variety of animals species and animal shows to see. There is a water play area that's great for kids.
Other than the zoo, there is a separate night safari and river safari attraction. Do check out the bundle ticket prices and opening hours of each attraction."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I came here too often already. SG Zoo.. can sponsors my kids entry please? Since cb lifted up, we came 4 times liao."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,A very well kept zoo with natural beauty of the luscious rainforest calming your minds. I feel the animals have become more active after the social distancing measures in place and lesser people around!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Wonderful place to spent time with your kids. All the staffs are very helpful and polite. Please consult the show times before you enter the park coz animal shows are the best part of the zoo. Don't miss the shows. Over all me and my family enjoyed a lot here.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great for a day out with family or friends. Advisable to bring sunscreen as weather may be hot.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best zoo. Lively and well taken care animals. Amazing Show arrangement and program to suite everyone need.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It was great place for kids. The tram is a must, I would say. Best show. Is the sealion Pedro. Don't miss it. The kids love it."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best zoos. Awesome location in the rainforest. Great displays with lots of active and unique animals
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The animals are so well kept. Unlike other zoos, the animals are kept in a very comfortable and friendly environment."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoos in Asia. If you only have time to go to one of the many animal parks in Singapore, this is it. The zoo is well laid out, with two loops that are easily walkable. I recommend the elephant show, African animals and reptile section. There is also a playground for kids and a water play area. Kids will definitely love it!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Best Zoo I have ever visited. It is huge so great that the animals have space. A map is a must and good walking shoes. Best to take/buy trolley tickets and do a round on them to get your bearings and note which areas or animals you want to visit. The trolley takes about 25 minutes to do a round so gives you the size of the zoo when you walk. Wonderful experience and taking a tour as I did was very helpful as one gets a lot of background and the guide ensures you won't get lost getting in, as it can be confusing even though everything is signposted in English."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This is clearly one of the best zoos in the world. It is so clean, well shaded, and people friendly, we love coming back here. Be sure to book early for the orangutan breakfast. It has a good selection of food in the buffet breakfast, and a close encounter with some animals. The trams run frequently and if you bring your own headphones, you can listen to the commentary in different languages."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A really great experience! Most animals a roaming freely in the zoo and many shows are offered, including hand feeding by visitors.
Reasonable pricing for entrance and restaurants. Plan at least 4 hours to view all. A lot of Picknick areas in case you want to BYO."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place to spend a day with family and little ones. Plan your trip early and catch the feeding times. Also do visit river safari to catch the giant panda.

During covid-19 you need go pre book your time slot online. Animal feeding also required online booking in addition to the fees and queue. Overall visit during covid-19 is more pleasant than usual maybe due to the limited guests admitted. Do also take note pram service is suspended till further notice.

Dated: 26th July 2020"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Oh man! What you don't get to see here. You literally see almost all the animals of the world. Allot 1 complete day to this place. I'm giving my words, it's really worth it.
Time it will take to complete zoo will be 6.5-7.5 hours."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A complete tableau of wildlife. Mammals, fish, reptilia exhibited in their natural setting. A must for family and kids to instill awareness and love of the natural world. Complete with interpretations and information. The River safari features the ecosystem and the importance of the river/water ways in the different continents"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Had a wonderful time! Must visit
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Excellent, world class facility but could do with some upgrades and additional variety."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Love the new process for entrance. Didnt like the fact that maps are now online. Try to avoid lunch time coz it'll get pack. Pls pls bring mosquito patches
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,It's been about 10 yes since my last visit and the number of animals in exhibits seem to have shrunk significantly.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best activities in Singapore - went with my kids - we had a fun time - one of best zoos in the world as well. Clean and Tidy. Elephant 🐘 Show is the feather to the Crown, don't miss it. Safari Show is another fun-time as well. There are animal feedings too. It's worth for the money spent, a whole day time with family. Anytime we can visit Zoo in the future. Thanks to the Staffs for making it a wonderful spot in Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,One of the best zoo i have ever visited. Must visit of you are touring Singapore. We can see animals real close and very well maintained zoo
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place to spend time. Very clean and well maintained place.  (price per person $29-$33).
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Really nice animals
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The way developed place is too nature friendly. You can see animal very closely.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Excellent set up. Nice walk. The morning weather is great in December.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Absolutely beautiful zoo, great atmosphere and staff very friendly. Great place for the whole family both young and old. Highly recommend!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore zoo is a once in a lifetime experience.
With live shows and interactive experiences this is one of the best times I've had.
You have the bird show, then the elephant show and you can actually feed the tiger cubs there.
There are various open enclosures for the animals.
And it has many facilities like spic and span washrooms and a separate area to eat.
There are individual recreational spaces for kids to.
If you are an animal lover, you will have a gala time here."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,You can always take the tram if you're tired of walking. Pygmy hippos were cute. The Reptopia was the most exciting stop for my kids
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,We’ve purchased the family annual pass which seems to be good value. When stuck for ideas on the weekend we have headed out to the one of the zoos with the kids and they have enjoyed each visit.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Animals looked healthy and staff were polite and gracious with Covid practices in place and relevant signs and marking around the zoo
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Very exciting zoo where the animals get so close that you would be able to touch them. My kids were thrilled to be able to pet them. And make sure to check the feeding time because the little ones would surely want to participate.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Long standing, government backed zoo in Singapore. As of Jul 2021 is still undergoing renovation to add more exhibits and carpark area. Truly international class. To fully cover the entire park and scheduled animal shows, one would need approximately 6 hours. Canteen area (Ah Meng's) is near the central plaza not far off from main entrance. Water coolers and vending machines are available all over the park (beware that mineral water is not sold, only soft drinks, bring your own refillable water bottle). There is also a kids' zone in the far NW where they can ""interact"" with animals (goat only as of late). You can chain your visit to River Safari after lunch hour and make it a whole day affair."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The Singapore zoo is one of the most visited zoos of the world. The animal shows, the feeding time for animals, petting opportunity for visitors, the night safari and environmental conscious zoo keepers makes it more interesting place for kids. You could see few rodents moving around freely."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This was the highlight of my trip to Singapore. I head heard many good things about the zoo but my expectations were very much exceeded! Facilities and food were of a high quality and all staff were friendly and accommodating. Would definitely visit again!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very nice experiencein the zoo! Comfortable design and humane facilities, such as the free drinking water  fountain."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Empty on a weekday. Great time to visit the Singapore Zoo. Loved the elephant show and got to feed the elephants. Always a magical experience and brings out the kid in me!
I also got to pet the madagascan hissing cockcroach❤️"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place, it is as good as Australia Zoo, plus it has the Night Safari too. Animals are well kept and cared for,there is research and educational programs too."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"one of the finest zoos worldwide, loved it"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Good walk with family!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Best place to visit with kids
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,I had a very good time.  My favorite is to have breakfast with orangutans.  Reservation is required.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Probably the best Zoo in the world. Animals are not caged in metal structures therefore it is very accessible to get up-close and personal with the animals.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,A day well spent at Singapore Zoo. Observing and learning about various endangered species. From the proud stance of the two white tigers to monkeys sharing a bag of potato chips. But more importantly my grandma enjoyed it.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Loved it here since i was a kid. Came here all the time and it always had that flair that just attracted me to it like bees to honey. The animals are well taken care of and the enclosures are generously spaced. The design of the zoo is great. Really feels like a rainforest zoo. 10 stars all the way!!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Amongst a whole lot of beautiful animals they have at the zoo, the Pandas took our breath way. These gentle giants are located at the cornest side of the zoo towards the end actually.

You can easily spend a whole day in the zoo. The kids have a special area with a wonderful waterpark.

Went during a weekend. Therefore, had to endure some long ques at eateries, rides and washrooms."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,The zoo is always clean and atteactive except food and restaurant options within zoo is limited and rooms for improvement.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the world’s top zoos, definitely worth a visit while In Singapore. Allow at least 3-4 hours because there’s so many exhibits to see."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"More than a zoo, this place looks like a park, or a natural reserve. Nature is all around. Efforts seems to have been done to make the zoo unique, in the respect of the animals. Crocodiles are under the bridge, apes accross the river, or roaming in the trees. You wouldn't maybe know it's a special place unless you would have visited sad zoos with animals in cage in other places of the world."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"When we visited in January they offered 4 packages at half price and with a flexibility of timing too. Fantastic value for money. Bought tickets for family including tram rides.

This Zoo is one of the best I have seen and it offers enough excitement to children & adults alike. You don’t get bored at all while moving from one area to another. Very well maintained & safety measures are excellent. Visitor-facilities are just too good. Enjoyed thoroughly.

There’s concession given to Senior Citizens of Singapore only but this needs to be extended to other Nationalities as well."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore Zoo is designed in a natural rainforest environment and has 11 zones inhabited by various wildlife from around the world. Some of the famous ones are the Australasia zone, Primate Kingdom, Reptile Garden, Tortoise Shell-ter, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, Fragile Forest , and others. With an area of approximately 26 hectares, the Singapore Zoo, which has been around for 40 years, is inhabited by more than 2,400 specimens from 300 species of mammals, birds and reptiles."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Back to nature, away from concrete jungle."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A wonderful zoo with sections themed around different parts of the world. I was so happy to see so many of my favourite animals from where I stay, Africa. Be prepared to walk quite a bit because this zoo is quite big. What I truly love about this zoo is that the animals are not in caged enclosures (with the exception of certain birds but for obvious reasons). All of the animals roam around freely in their enclosure. It's completely open and the only thing preventing the animals from getting close to you is a big gap that the animals can't jump across. I loved witnessing the White Tigers casually stroll around and play in the water. The White Tiger is majestic and so beautiful. I also saw the Malayan Tiger at night that is absolutely beautiful but it is unfortunately critically endangered. The zoo is doing it's best to make you aware of both plant and animal conservation. They will give you writeups of every animal and let you know wether it's safe or endangered. Overall it's a very nice zoo with a wide selection of animals to see. The Orangutans are so playful, I loved watching them swing around. Otters might be the cutest animal ever, I love them! I also watched the elephant and seal show which was entertaining. I highly recommend a visit if you're in Singapore."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"It is well kept, clean & organised. You can leisurely walk and spend as much time as you want at each enclosure as there are seats in the viewing area & most of them are air conditioned. It is an ideal place to bring kids as the whole family can spend an educational & interesting day in the park."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Big place, lot of animals in a well maintained and clean environment..roads are neat.. enough drinking water and toilets for public, eateries.... special shows . So good.."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Enjoyable and relaxing stroll at the zoo,a great day where most of the animals are out from their dens for us to admire their cuteness and beauty."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing zoo. Can easily spend half a day or longer. Unlike other zoos with cramped enclosures, Singapore zoo has a lot of open space allowing you to reasonably interact with a lot of wildlife. You also have feeding sessions with animals. If you have a telephoto lens you'll get some amazing close up shots of the birds and reptiles. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. There's always transportation available to ferry you from one place to another if you can't walk anymore. Food is a bit overpriced though."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Family friendly, with lots of animal to view. Food at Ah Meng Restaurant is 7/10.  Need a lot of walking and parents who are bringing kids may not be able to explore every corner in a visit."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Really lovely zoo.. So we'll planned and organised a must if you in Singapore. Entry can take a while but once in its well worth it... Also the night safari is brilliant might you if you need to see all vunues it can be up too 2 days. I like the River safari the must.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,It's aging. Like the airport it is in need of a major facelift.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing zoo!  We were a leader to feed the elephants and gigantic turtles.  The zoo was clean, well operated, the staff were all knowledgable.   It was as good as the Bronx Zoo (our home zoo which we love).  We will go back soon for the night safari."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Amazing this is my second time coming and this time we went and did the river safari and for only 5 dollars it was fantastic being extremely close to the animals like a touch range and seeing so many different birds and monkeys and so many other creatures the zoo part is terrific being able to see so many different animals with even the monkeys swinging from the trees above it is defiantly a must go to for the family.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Very nice environment but baboon enclosure cannot see the baboons.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A big zoo with many kinds of animals living in good environment, interesting and informative shows as well"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Probably the best zoo in the world. Amazing effort to make the enclosures cage free as much as possibly and to promote conservation at every corner.

Always a pleasure to visit the zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Directions ( signs)  can be better. Maybe the map should be a complimentary for visitors.

Everything else was nice and beautiful."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"Zoo seems quite poorly maintained from my last visit. A lot of construction going on and hopefully it improves over time. Animals mostly resting in the afternoon so not much to see.

Went on Saturday afternoon and it was quite crowded. Weather quite humid so dress comfortably!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Well-maintained zoo. Transport between one attraction to another is very far and the shuttles were always full (long queue).
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It was amazing, it been years since I stepped foot into the park. Brought back some memories and its good to see the park constantly update itself. Of course I was quite disappointed when comes to the construction work going on, but that is parts and puzzlenof upgrading."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Koufu foodcourt at BUANGKOK SQUARE MALL is clean with lots of seats.

Only about 7 foodstalls.

PRIME supermarket at this mall caters to your grocery needs while Value Shop offers its usual budget stuff.

Punggol PCN is just 200 metres away."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Nice place. Lesser people, easy to move around."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,This place is amazing... The animals are kept in their natural habitat. The show's over here are free and amazing.. I suggest not to take shuttle ride as it just stops at 4 stops and you need to walk from there. According to me there is no zoo like this in India or Asia
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Night Safari was amazing. Definitely worth doing if you are in Singapore. Get there early and buy tickets online to avoid long lines. Would highly recommend.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Very beautiful zoo. Have many things to do like birds park, animal feeding n butterfly park. I really enjoyed there."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The experience was great. One of the best zoo I've visited.
Very neat and clean. There's tram service every station which is located few meters away from each point. Animals are classified according to their habitats."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It was definitely some of the best zoos I’ve been to. The navigation was good. Easy to walk to cover the whole zoo in 3.5 hours.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Awesome place, children enjoys a lot. Don't forget to take a scooter or a stroller if you have children. Take the tram rides but they don't stop at enclosures, only at designated points so you have to walk back to closely view the enclosures. Plan your ride accordingly"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Awesome place. Lots of animals and informative sessions on wildlife. Must visit if on a tour to Singapore. Needs a whole day for the Zoo and if interested, can go for the night safari"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Never fails to make our trip a pleasant and warm experience. The only thing I’d like to add is the pizza outlet inside the zoo is awesome. They serve really nice pizza. A pity there is not enough seating area though.

Very clean, well maintained, and would very much want to come back again sometime soon.

One more thing, as of this writing, there is still bottle refills counter, so no worries, no need to keep buying water bottles or water. One can bring water bottle for refill of water. Just no water fountain where you can drink directly from the spout."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Day in Singapore Zoo, It was an wonderful experience in Zoo, where we could see few new animal which we had never seen before like Kangaroo and polar bear. the zoo is so well and clean maintained, my kid enjoyed a lot here. We were unable to see the Shows as we reached here by 12.00, it is recommended to be here by 10.00 so that you can watch all the Shows."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It was a hot day but visiting the zoo was worth it. One of the cleanest and biggest zoo I tried so far. We decided to go 3pm. The zoo close at 6pm. Better go early if you want to catch the animals shows in between. It’ll be convenient take the tram train at $5 for unlimited rides if you kids or old people with you. I’m not old but I took it myself just to save my energy lol
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"World most awarded zoological tourist attraction. Newly upgraded amphibian enclosure, kids high element obstacles, kids world pet enclosure! A new level of attraction experience! A refreshing visit for frequent visitors! Great family outing!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Good range of animals within a small but comfortable area.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Not much animals to experience. Many shows and activities are suspended due to COVID situation.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Beautiful and spacious. Well maintained and healthy animals. Wide varieties of animals. My sons totally enjoyed themselves.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Kids always fun to visit Singapore zoo..
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,1,Poor experience these days the whole place is one big building site unfortunately. It is so quiet taxis don't come there anymore either. A pity after so many good times. Give it a couple of years ...
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"My zoo experience was amazing. If you are an animal lover like me than even 24hrs at singapore zoo will seem less. Love the snakes.. made a friend too Rosy, a snow white snaky. Seal show and water splash show was too good. The actors were excellent."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,"There's a lot of walking. you can rent powered buddies.

Seems like I see a lot more trees and vegetation and maybe roads than animals.

I remember the zoo to be a lot more lively.

The zoo is at least a 3/4 it 1 full day. Taking the tram helps movement, but the tram stops are quite far apart"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,I have not been to a lot of zoos but this one definitely impressed me. All the displays are designed to avoid using cages so you get very closeup and unobstructed views of the animals. The most dangerous or climate sensitive animals are behind glass walls and their spaces are designed to encourage them to be as close to the walls as possible. There are also small shows and a tram going through the park for those tired of walking.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Honestly one of the best zoos in the world. We went in the morning. Beautiful sunrays
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Wonderful place to spend with family eapecially if you are animal lovers. They have many animals and they are well maintained. I also like their effort to breed the animals and if possible save endangered animals from extinction.

Public amenities are also adequate. Water dispensers are available in a few places. However we hav to bring our own water bottles. Toilets are also easy to find."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapor zoo is also one of the better tourism spot where you will be able to have a closer look at the wild life animals and birds too.
The best part is that they provide us entertaining show's what makes this place more interesting and informative too.
My experience here was not that great overall but the sea lion show performance was lit 🔥 af a must watch show if you ever had a visit at this zoo"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Awesome
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The zoo was great! Arrived here around 9.30am and it wasn't super busy yet which was nice. Try to get to each of the shows and visit the animals around their feeding times to really see them up close and active otherwise most of them tend to be napping at other times. Try to get to each show at least 15 - 20mins beforehand if you want a good seat too. Great experience!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Love this place! Takes about 5 hours to complete, when come with LO, it includes lunch time and rest time along the walk. Each trip have some differ surprise!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,3,Went with a 3 year old who loved playing on the rope bridge as well as the butterfly area with birds walking around. Problem is many of the things at the Kids play area were closed and the Aircon in the KFC and gifts shops was barely on making it super stuffy. The really need to fix up and open all the stiff at the Kids play area.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Wonderful zoo!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,I absolutely LOVED this zoo. One of the favorites I have ever been to.  It’s kept very clean and all the animals were pretty active or atleast laying in sight of the onlookers.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best place to visit in Singapore. Wide range of animals and birds with informative boards. Some exciting shows for children. Anyone visiting Singapore zoo should check out the timing of these shows and plan the visit accordingly. To experience the animals, I would rate Singapore zoo much higher than night safari. Good place to spend a full day with family.
Singapore encourages ti reuse the plastic bottle to refill water. Carry a good quality water bottle and refill at water stations provided at multiple locations. Save the environme as well as some money."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Every visit was wonderfull here, nature and the animals. Staff was very helpful on guiding you thru the map 👏"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Had a great experience with my family. We enjoyed the animal shows a lot. Some of the exhibits such as white tiger and polar-bear were closed due to maintenance.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Good for all age ;).  Plan your visit ahead and pack lots of food and drinks if you like to spend full day here . Can be very annoying with kids, if you don't take strollers.  You get it here on rental basis too. Membership is best way to enjoy the Singapore zoo economically and year around ."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The animals are generally shy after the circuit breaker 😅
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,The zoo is huge and has many types of animals. It is very educational place. The landscape of the zoo looks like a jungle instead of the usual rows of caged animals that we normally see. You could walk along the trails to see the animals. It is a good exercise and outing for family.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Zoo clean and well designed,easy to get around, and the staff are very helpful.Maybe try to open the other exhibits next time?"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"What an incredible place! Even as two grown adults without kids, we spent the whole day exploring the zoo. This was a world class zoo. We loved seeing the Panda Bears in the River Safari too."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Singapore zoo while not as big is still a wonderful place to explore and enjoy. Modern facilities, well-kept animals and interesting exhibits with some star animals make it a must visit for any tourist.

Just watch out for the heat and food/drink prices. Recommend to bring your own!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Very beautiful maintained  zoo, make sure to do the river safari as well."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Amazing zoo.
Better than the river safari.
Reasonably expensive and no discount for senior citizen unless you’re a local. But great experience."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Lovely zoo with good bit of information provided about them.

Only gripe I had is with the animal shows esp the elephant one. I hope they close the exhibit. If I want to see stressed out elephants I would go to Thai elephant parks. Being such a animal conservation place, this show just leaves a bad taste in mouth.

Go on weekends when they feed their crocodiles because trust me, a leaping 1 ton crocodile is something you would remember for a long time."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"I entered River Safari. Honestly I did not like two Panda are caged in a chill house, they must be annoyed so much by the visitors. However, looks like the management really do take care of all animals, so here goes the five-stars rating for this place.
I love free cruise offered by the zoo if we purchase River Safari ticket. There was also a show but very crowded so I almost did not see anything except the crowd."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Worth going if you qre visiting Singapore and have a few hours available.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Nice
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Beautifully maintained Zoo, lots of different animals to see. A good fun day activity with family. Animal shows in different zones are must to be attended (free of cost) they are highly engaging. Wet Play Area a free for all is another good zone to unwind just keep a pair of swimwear for kids."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore zoo one of most beautiful place. Lot's of animal have in this zoo. Singapore Airlines passenger 10% discount for this place visitors. Visitor train have here.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Our favourite place to visit during the first day of Chinese New Year!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoo I have ever visited. Close encounters with animals, feeding sessions, play areas for kids, tram rides, picnic areas. Something for everyone. Highly recommended"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of Singapore best attraction. Always a joy to visit however, remember to use inset repellent :) These month is worth visit as they are having promotion, 50% off for Zoo and river safari."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A great place for taking your children to see variety of animal, the place was great, clean, and the employee are friendly"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best places to spend your day here in Singapore. This zoo allows to observe animals very closely. Bring your kids they will love this place.

Tickets are available online with discounted prices. Check with several agents before purchase. Also check about membership program if you are planning to visit again soon."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Fantastic collection of animals. Just wow!! Animals are kept according to their habitat which is created well and safe for the visitors. From kids to old age people will enjoy spending time here. It will leave you amused, happy and excited throughout the stay. The live animal show's which they conduct is mind-blogging. Animals are trained so well, it's a life time experience for everyone. 2nd time visit to this place, it's much more updated. Happy to be here once again. In love !! Never miss it out."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Awesome & great place to visit.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Really good place to visit with kids.  Well organized and good path to see animals. The shoes are the highlights, cannot miss them. No tiger and polar bear.  Not the biggest zoo , but clean and we'll organized.  If you have kids they   will like it. Good for day picnic"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Because of Covid, there are many safety measures in place which helps to ensure the visitors. It was overall pretty fun and spent the whole day there! That was surprising 🙂"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Its nice to take kids once in a while to zoo. But this time i noticed some of the animals not there anymore like polar bear.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Excellent outing to Singapore Zoo.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore Zoo is a must visit place in Singapore. Well maintained and organized. You can see some rare animals like pandas there. Animal feeding sessions and various shows available. You will get a map of zoo when you entering and show times are printed on that. Make sure to go on Amazon quest boat ride and its an amazing experience.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Here is nice place to spend a time with family. Staff is so kindness. What is great point is close to animals and great organized atmosphere. If you want to take a photo with Orangutans during breakfast, I recommend to go there around 8:30 or booking table. Otherwise your seat is far from Orangutans."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Highly recommend a visit, clean, tidy and super friendly staff. Animals are well cared for."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Get the multi park pass. It's worth it. Come in the morning with time and patience. Make sure you watch the shows they are beautifully executed. Put your phone down and look around. The place is gorgeous.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,I visited Singapore Zoo on Thursday 10th Oct 2019. It was a really nice place. It's clean and well - organized. Animals look happy being there and I enjoyed my day a lot :)
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Very hot at the time I visited. Should watch out your kid at all time while in the zoo.

Great place."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"A must go place for every Singaporean, never failed to bring us lasting memories and fun filled experience. A place often visited since childhood, watching the animals grow and mature, zoo has developed and evolved well and facilities upgraded making this zoo one of a kind, comparable to others."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Designed to be as open as possible and really delivers! It feels like there's nothing between you and a lion. Wide range of exhibits, and with multiple feeding times and shows there's always something to do. The white tigers and chimpanzee feeding were highlights."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Its worth to attend the feeding times and watch the various presentation. Taking the “train” to get around is recommended, if you are visiting with kids. Distances between thr various shows can take its toll, given the hot climate. The reptile exhibition is one of the best I’ve seen so far. Definitely worth a day trip."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Very nice zoo where you can get in close contact with the animals.

Only the penguin area was not so nice and big. The penguins should get a better home!

It is also weird that you have to buy three very expansive tickets to see all animals. For example the Panda bears you can just see on the river safari tour which is extra to the normal zoo...

All in all I strongly recommend this zoo."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This is hands down the best zoo we have been to

Feeding the elephants was amazing

Everything was super clean with awesome enclosures for the animals"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Be prepared for a lot of walking! Love the open atmosphere.
There's plenty to see - we were there from 10.45am to 5pm and we didn't manage to visit all exhibits.
Enjoyed the areas where you could see creatures up close without enclosure. A number of enclosures have glass viewing panels.
Seems there's only one main eatery at the main area, there was some fast food further into the zoo and near the kids area.
There's a kids water play area too, though that defeats the purpose of going to the zoo...
Overall, well worth going, as there's something for everyone in the family."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,We can experience getting closer to many wild animals. They offer 20% off on retails and restaurant for members. That is a good approach for people who would like to visit the park for a day.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"If you're a nature lover then this is your go-to place! Singapore Zoo is an incredible place to see all kinds of Asiatic animals as well as few from around the world. They have continent wise dedicated zones and you can see many uncommon or endangered species as well. Reaching here is easy, you need to get down at Ang Mo Kio Station and board the Singapore Zoo bus that runs at a frequency of 10 to 12 minutes. For ease, you can buy the tram ticket and make your journey relaxing within the zoo. Highly recommended for the nature and wildlife enthusiasts."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Love the way they manage and take care of animals here, good place to spend a weekend with family"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Nice place, friendly atmosphere. One gripe I have with it is the food selection. Other than that, I loved it"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"The place is okay,but the ticket is quite expensive"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,World class zoo with many shows to watch and animals to see. Everything is so well laid out and there are many rest points along the way. There is even a dedicated kids play zone with water parks to relax at. A enjoyable destination for locals and tourists alike.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Have been to zoos all round the world and this is one of the best. Easy to book on line and fun to navigate around the complex
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Very interesting sea lion show.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"I would love to give it 5 stars but because of covid 19, the queues to restaurant have been really bad. Queue time about an hour and I came in with toddler, there is no priority of any sorts. They could have add more friendly booth that sell on the go food like drinks with sandwiches. I would have brought in my own food if I knew in advance.

Otherwise the attraction are still top notch with many animal to watch and learn. Definitely one of the best zoo for many years."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,World Bicycle Day
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Free roaming concept. Very well managed. Animal variety aplenty. Keep looking for new themes to bring back both locals and visitors. One of the best in the region!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It is a zoo with different animals whom are well cared for, quite free and they look happy the surroundings are spectacular as well. This was definitely one of the best attraction in Singapore.  And also it is clean and very accessible on foot. Animal presentations are educational, showcasing the animals in their natural behavior and habits."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"It is a zoo with different animals whom are well cared for, quite free and they look happy the surroundings are spectacular as well. This was definitely one of the best attraction in Singapore.  And also it is clean and very accessible on …"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Beautiful zoo. Safaris are really nice, probably even better than the zoo itself. It is a well maintained zoo and the animals have nice places, but still too small sometimes. Among the zoos I've seen it is definitely one of the best. All the vegetation makes it a great place for a walk."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"One of the best zoo's I have been to in my entire life. It is very clean and very well organized, I recommend you'll to start exploring it from one side and then the center. It has a variety of various animals birds as well as reptile's. The polar bear was my favorite as well as the various penguins and kangaroos. An amazing place for a weekend family trip."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Well maintained zoo with great food. Do not expect a senior discount unless you are a citizen of Singapore. It's the Asian way for foreigners to pay more.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Crowd control was in place, very relax and enjoyed the visit"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"This zoo is the best I have ever been to, and I have been visiting since young. Due to COVID tourists can't come here though"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Always enjoyable and pleasant walk around the zoo!!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Singapore zoo is a place worth visiting. It is specially a place where kids will enjoy a lot. Zoo is beautifully maintained and variety of animals can be seen here. Do not forget to take map before visiting the zoo as it is quite big. Food items are quite expensive here so buy carefully.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Great place to visit as a tourist. The river safari is a waste of time and money for those who try to see something new; Peace lovers can give it a try. Some animals and birds are allowed to free roam, so that the visitors get a live experience. Highly recommended place for one time visit"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Great place to go for fun
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,Had fun! It was raining a little but was still fine. There are some places that are indoor or paths with shelter. Very nice place to come in weekend :)
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Zoo is Clean and well spaced out. Animals look healthy but a little camera shy. Really good for a family outing!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"The exhibits are well taken care of. The nature and wildlife is very vibrant and interesting, also offers a wonderful educational experience for kids AND adults!"
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,Fun place to be at with your friends and families! Can take the shuttle bus to go there. Lots of animals to see. The zoo is abit old but the conditions for the animals are still alright. Would recommend!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,"Amazing place with a wide variety of animals and plenty of care taken to include interesting facts for visitors to learn. Loved the shows put on at various intervals!

Park overall doesn't feel too crowded due to its sheer size, but the eating places are horrible to be at due to the massive crowds, lack of seating, long queues and mess left behind by previous guests.

Would say this is more a must-do for Singapore locals looking for a fun day out rather than tourists."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Must visit if you're in singapore. I've never seen animals so closely ever. Keep your walking shoes handy there is a good amount of walk. We went for the night safari as well. You can spend a good amount of time here , easily  5-6 hours. They have a good variety of animals from around the world. Check out the show timings so that you can plan the day well in advance. We enjoyed the dolphin show and the elephant show here."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,It is a fantastic experience at zoo. The place has all the facilities and it made our life so easy to navigate. This is a good place if you are taking your family outside. My parents were excited coming back home.
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"Friendly staff, evenly placed tram spots, eateries, drinks, kindly maintained animals. Never seen animals in love and being loved by their keepers. Feeding the giraffe, beaver, elephants, touching the snakes was never thought of. Open hall shoes that the animals did was truly a memorable one. However they may be trained, but at the time of execution, the stage belongs to the animals. They ruled and won our hearts.

Night safari, Amazon river quest are a must try."
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,4,One of the best zoo in the world. Abundance of various animal species and types. A great place to spend a day with your family looking at nature's wonders and beauty. Do visit Amazon River Quest. It's exciting!
Singapore Zoo: Attractions & Things to Do,5,"We had read that the zoo is one of the best in the world. It lived up to the reputation. Free range orangutans. Aviary with more than just birds. Getting up close with ring tailed lemurs. Great educational information at each exhibit reminding us, without being preachy, of the role we as consumers play in the vulnerability of many of these beautiful animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari is located between Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. It is a river theme zoo with large aquarium exhibits of animals such as fresh water fishes, manetees, alligators, green anaconda, electric eel and etc. Star attractions besides river animals are the Giant Panda and Red Panda. The River Safari has sheltered walkways and some of the animals enclosure are air-conditioned."
River Safari Singapore,5,"One of the best ways to spend an afternoon in Singapore. The Panda's may be the highlight for sure, but everything else from the sea cows(look those up) doing their spins to the Jaguars on the Amazon River Quest. Tiger fish too... Yes that's a thing. Good scenery too
Amaizing!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Experience was very good as the entire zone js shaded, have fans and a large amount of space is fully air conditioned. There are many marine animals to see but the most amazing thing to watch are Pandas. They are just so cute to watch. We could not take the boat ride as our child didn't meet the minimum height requirement to ride the boat. May be next time. Overall it was a very good experience and a very family friendly place."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Most exhibitions are shaded or inside the buildings, so you can enjoy looking around even in a hot or rainy day."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Awesome wonderful time. One of the best zoos in the world. Lots of different animals, great enclosures that have wide spaces, the animals look happy and relaxed. Highly recommended and great to help out the parks during lower admittance."
River Safari Singapore,4,"It was a relaxing experience because of Covid entry restrictions. It felt like we have the whole park to ourselves. However it was a pity that we could only see one of the pandas, Kai Kai. The capybaras were adorable and it was fascinating to watch the manatees swimming in a group."
River Safari Singapore,5,A great place to explore life in and near the rivers. Most of the exhibits are shaded and there is plenty to learn. The manatees exhibit was my favourite. The panda exhibit was not available cos it I'd mating season so check before you head there. The Amazing River Quest was a good break to sit and watch. Go for it!!
River Safari Singapore,3,"Attraction is shaded which is good. Many attractions were closed, such as the river boat ride, the monkey enclosure and the amazon ride. Be sure to check whether attractions are open before going."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Nice place to see many varieties of Fish and sea animals.
Can easily spend half a day here.
If you are a family person, I suggest to take an annual pass. I bout a 2adults + 1 child annual subscription for SGD 155.
There is a free show here at 12 PM, 2 PM, 4:30 PM worth waiting.
Food is expensive here, so better carry some food."
River Safari Singapore,4,"River Safari shows animals that live along major rivers around the world. There is only one route to follow so most people move along with you.

River Safari features many animals, especially those in seawater and some of the tanks are enormous!

We really enjoy the show featuring beavers, pelicans, capybaras and snakes. It’s just a pity that with younger children, we can’t get on the Amazon ride. The more boring boat ride is currently closed."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A clean and pretty zoo filled with animals that seem safe and happy.

The best parts of the River Safari are the adorable free-roaming red pandas who can come right up to you if they so choose, the lazy giant pandas in their sprawling enclosure, the impressive flooded Amazonian rainforest exhibit with its three viewing levels, and the short but fun Amazon River Quest.

The wife was already talking about coming back as we were leaving."
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place to visit for the families. Try your lucky to get to see both the pandas as Jia Jia is shy. Always hide inside the house. Managed to get to see both of them. 😊
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great experience! Was raining but thankfully it's mostly sheltered. Directional signs were clear and good service staff around. Note that the Starbucks is outside the premise, so grab your coffee before entering. Pretty long queues for Giant Panda Forest and Amazon River Quest due to social distancing but they move along. We spent about 3+ hours inside and my 5YO had fun!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Clean. Friendly staff. Safe paths & easy to explore. Therapeutic to view the beauty of animals, watch fishes & manatees swim. Nature of creation never fail. Boat ride and show are interesting. Enjoyable day and time well spent for me in River Safari."
River Safari Singapore,5,River Safari is a fantastic place to visit for newcomers as we get to explore the hidden gems of Singapore (see photos below). But after your first visit it may not be the best experience anymore thus it's recommended to get the most out of your first visitation!
River Safari Singapore,4,"Was worth, but have to be mindful that u need to be 1 hour before atleast"
River Safari Singapore,4,Wonderful for kids and adults too...amazon ride is average. Overall...nice
River Safari Singapore,5,Fantastic experience and lovely service staff throughout the entire visit!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Singapore River Safari is so much better than RWS SEA Aquarium. Quite an open space for people to walk and enjoy seeing the fresh water fishes and mostly shaded along the walkway. Quite easy to find the entrance, just follow the directions from the multi storey carpark where the drop off point is located. Too bad the river cruise ride is closed during the pandemic or else it would have been perfect."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Going to the River Safari was a great experience! Cool to see so many interesting and varied animals (otter, crocodile, manatees, electric eel, etc.) from across the world.

Watching the spider monkeys being fed and the pandas the lounging around were the highlights of the tour.

There will be time you will have to wait in line but the line moves pretty fast so its not too much of an issue. Restrooms are few and far in between so go ahead of time at the entrance before starting the tour."
River Safari Singapore,3,Highlight of the river safari was the pandas. Place is well sheltered and suitable for families with strollers. Nursing room is clean and well maintained.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Great experience and knowledge for Amazon River and forest adventure tour. Learning about the current condition and climate in the Amazon area with knowledge about species extinction.
Its a plus point to include the Amazon River Quest Ride into your package.
Tickets recommended to purchase on the spot as its non refundable in then event when it rains"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Lots of interesting animals to look at up close! Plenty of shelter so you won’t get too hot and drenched in the rain. Animals kept there doesn’t have any sign of abuse or malnourishment. A great learning trip for kids and adults alike!

Highlight will be the panda enclosure where it’s fully air conditioned and extremely clean. Too bad the pandas didn’t really like to come out of their caves so most of the time you can just see them far away and their backs.

There’s also a zone where you go into a cage and the monkeys there roam freely. Really fun to see them up close and not snatching your belongings (have to leave food outside and advised to put your bags in front of you).

There’s a restaurant in there which I’ve yet to try but based on other reviews online it seems overpriced and not that tasty. Usually food places within zoo compound have touristy prices so if you can always bring your own food...

Love the long bridge that allows you to overlook the wide open view of the mandai river (or lake?) there’s benches there so for those that needs to do some self reflection can sit there and do it for a fee."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Enjoyed our day at the River Safari. Pleasantly surprised to note that the whole park has sheltered walkways. So rain or shine, this is a perfect place for a family outing. The information posted along the way is very helpful and educational. The River Cruises are suspended temporarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic but the River Quest ride is still operating normally. This is perhaps the best time to visit as there is no crowding and we really have time to enjoy the exhibits, especially the pandas. Will visit again for the shows."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to spend the mornings. Not a lot of people. Weather was great!
River Safari Singapore,5,Beautiful... About a one hour walk around the river. Good for bringing kids and if you do not wanna walk so much. Love the river view.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Raining day when we were here, still worried about the visit. But found most of the path sheltered or indoor. And also because of raining, the boat not operate for safety reasons. Some of the point under construction and we cannot see most of the animals as the signboard showing."
River Safari Singapore,4,"A well thought out destination that focuses on river monsters and strangely, it’s the only place in Singapore to view pandas. The highlight of the visit was the Amazon River Quest boat ride, and as for the pandas, they were just sleeping and we could only view from far.

Unfortunately, no way this is close to the experience at the Singapore Zoo, even when they moved the pandas from the Zoo to the River Safari to promote this new destination"
River Safari Singapore,5,Was really a great experience at River Safari....could explore to many more unseen animals....such a beautiful time I could hang out there....
River Safari Singapore,4,"The Amazon boat ride is fantastic even though a short one..Kids would enjoy it and want to go for another round definitely. Try to get a seat in front row to enjoy the best of this ride. Other than amazon boat ride, we found the rest of it slightly boring..wished the boat ride was slightly longer :)

Their daily animal show runs at half the seating capacity due to social distancing measures..so the queue was long and if we didnt queue, would miss it."
River Safari Singapore,5,Fun Amazon Quest boat ride despite the drizzle which turned heavier. Depends on your luck as to whether you get to spot the animals.
River Safari Singapore,5,"It seems like visiting mini zoo and mini aquarium.  A small surprise when entered a place seems like a cage that you can be very near to some animals and saw some big birds there too.  There are some free water dispensers there too.  Overall, a pleasant 4.5 hours trip there."
River Safari Singapore,5,"One of my favourite attractions in Singapore which I'll never tire of. I think the Singapore Zoo does a wonderful job of curating the animal exhibits for all their parks and am looking forward to the future developments of this area. A great place for both the young and for adults who never want to grow up. They really do try their best to educate on conservation which I appreciate.

Do consider bringing your own snacks and drinks as the food choices are quite limited."
River Safari Singapore,5,Majority of exhibits are related to fresh water river habitats around the world. Panda exhibit is the odd one out.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Nice place to hang out but not much actly and the boat ride is short without seeing most animals, if you like monkeys and fishes and pandas, can go!"
River Safari Singapore,5,wild life relax and chill to know more animals
River Safari Singapore,4,"The river safari are family friendly...all are undershade...lots of fishes n rare animals...safe n cozy surroundings...although my first times there, found it exciting la..."
River Safari Singapore,4,"The main attraction is the pandas, but you are lucky if you can see both as the female one is more shy and is usually in her retreat. The river cruise which I enjoy is also closed for maintenance. Still a nice place to visit and one can finish the whole place in 2 to 3 hours. For a complete package and a whole day out, recommend that you visit this place together with the zoo which is much bigger and more educational."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Perfect place for family outing. The whole place is sheltered so it's really a relaxing and educational walk with the little ones. We love the Squirrel Moneky Forest where you get to see them up close and little animals running around you freely.

Don't be imitated by the map, the place is really not that big and scary to conquer. Enjoy!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"2nd visit, spent 2.5hrs in total. Customer service is good as they managed to solve my ticketing issue prior to my visit. It was a fun learning experience about the different rivers and its habitats around the world. The 2 giant pandas were around in the morning. The female panda, Jiajia, is a little shy - she is cute in walking in and out of her private enclosure while Kaikai munch his bamboo."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A nice addition to the zoological gardens! You will be sheltered most of the time, except for the river ride and monkey area. Very amazing aquarium and species in display. This is actually more enjoyable than the classic zoo, and the pandas jiajia and kaikai are over there!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Had a lovely morning with River Safari! Though we missed the show however we still made it to see the panda & had a chance to be close to monkeys & turtles as much as we could. And we loved it!
Make sure to book your time online before heading to River Safari!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"We enjoyed so much! Wonderful place. Newer than the Zoo! Pandas were so cute, we managed to see them eating bamboo :D"
River Safari Singapore,5,"A river-themed collections of fauna and some pretty sceneries of Upper Seletar Reservoir. This place also exhibits the famous Panda Couple, Kaikai and Jiajia. The water ride is a must-ride, offering new experience of walking through the fauna exhibits. There are a restaurant next to the panda exhibit, and starbucks at the main entrance. Worth visiting for a fun family day out. For a walkthrough, most walkways are nicely covered so it's not really a problem during a rainy day."
River Safari Singapore,4,"A nice place to visit - clean and also plenty of cool resting area. Highlight of the River Safari will be its Amazon River Quest and also its animal show called Once Upon a River with its last show at 4.30pm. (Entrance will be 30mins before the show starts). That's also a eating resturant called Panda Mama kitchen.
Highly recommended for family, couples and any individual to check it out during this March school holiday 😊"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Applause to the park designers for the details. Great sinage, and lovely landscape with stars deserving their share of attention 🐊🐢🐠🐼🌳🍂⚘🌺"
River Safari Singapore,4,It's a nice place. Just that it seems kinda small . The whole place can be covered in about 3 to 4 hours if you don't stop for meals or the show. Other than that it's a worthwhile place to visit.
River Safari Singapore,4,Always love Singapore zoo. A place to learn about different animal. Is a place to come once in awhile.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Good place for children to learn about freshwater fishes!

It was as crowded as I expected it to be and there is plenty of room to walk and see the fresh water animals.

Just have to take note that the boat ride has a height requirement, so check on that before purchasing it."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Made used of the Singaporediscovers vouchers and went on a weekday morning. While the construction leading to the park and some refurbishment went not pleasant, I must admit the walk in the river safari was more pleasant than I expected. Most area are well covered from sun and some are even air conditioned (eg the pandans). Crowd was minimum and the park operators were nice enough to offer a re-ride for the river quest. Unfortunately the reservoir ride is still closed."
River Safari Singapore,4,Nice exhibitions and animals inside. I guess the only headache is getting here. Otherwise mum and I enjoyed ourselves as we have been to the Singapore Zoo way too many times. This was a breath of fresh air. Highly recommend for the whole family.
River Safari Singapore,5,Unique park focused on wildlife living along the major rivers around the world.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Plus points:
• Good that visits must be booked. Limiting potential overcrowding.
• Staff are friendly & helpful.
• Food taste is reasonable.
• Water cooler/ dispenser available outside toilets.
• Worth it to pay for amazon river cruise.

Minus points:
• No designated smoking point in the entire premises. There is a need to spare a thought for visitors who are pioneer/ merdeka generation, which smoking is habitual and a NEED for them in order to enjoy the entire visit.
• Depending on the mood of Jia Jia & Kai Kai - you may or may not see their movement."
River Safari Singapore,5,It was an enjoyable trip in River Safari because there no crowd during this period. We had enough time and space to admire the fishes and animals. And we finally able to get the ticket to take the Amazon River Quest ride. It was interesting and exciting for the kids. Great experience and friendly staff there.
River Safari Singapore,5,Definitely recommend! Nice and covered through most of it to protect from sun or rain. Seeing the pandas was amazing. The show was entertaining and the small boat ride was fun. Also loved the huge manatees!
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place to go during covid time but have to go early due to a lot of visitors during after lunch
River Safari Singapore,4,"Sheltered almost all the way. Very cool aquatic displays. But the boat ride is a hit and miss. Boat keeps moving, you might not see the animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,Amazing place! Beautiful animals! Artistically designed adventure place for the people. Well maintained. Friendly staff. I love love 🥰 it!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Our family had quite a fun morning visiting the river safari. Managed to see the manatees, howler monkeys, Jia Jia and Kai Kai the two pandas, flamingoes, red pandas and many more. The show at 1130 am was also quite interesting, especially the acts featuring the capybaras and the pelican. The boat ride was also pretty nice, and the family behind us managed to go one more round for free as there were not many visitors.
Two issues - better signages are needed - they lead clearly from the carpark to the zoom but then we had to staff to redirect us."
River Safari Singapore,5,Well designed. Not too big. Can finish touring within 2.5 hours
River Safari Singapore,5,"Parked at the multi-story carpark and took a short walk to the entrance. The exhibits were truly quite breathtaking. Place was clean, cool and sheltered. You can expect to pay about $8 parking for a typical 2.5 hour visit. River Safari is an awesome place to visit! Oh yes, remember to bring your debit or credit card along as you will need to key in the card information when buying your tickets online. Their website doesn’t seem to have the option for Apple/Google Pay."
River Safari Singapore,4,Is good to go during weekdays. The place is empty. we are able to see the panda without people blocking in front of us. And we can spend more time to observe the animals.
River Safari Singapore,5,I love coming here because it really takes the stress away to look at an array of animals peacefully going about their business.
River Safari Singapore,5,Good place to take a break from the city with it's greenery and sheltered walkways throughout. It can get crowded. Queue for panda enclosure was more than an hour long. River ride 45 minutes. All these despite less crowd due to covid-19.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday so it was not too crowded. It was raining when we went there, so some of the attractions were unavailable. We bought a $5 tickets for a boat ride and waited quite long before the staff told us there was a safety issue. They informed us to re-scan the tickets so that we could use the $5 for food or souvenirs. For the rest of the experience, it was quite nice. Will come back again on a sunny day..."
River Safari Singapore,4,"1 for 1 offer. And now u can pair with SRV!!
Since nothing much to do in SG, why not visit here then..."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Wonderful experience. For someone who had never seen a panda up close before, it was very exciting. Other exciting animals to see are the red panda, manatees, squirrel monkeys, jaguars and also the wonderful Amazon river quest ride.

I would recommend this place for all animal lovers - children or grown-ups."
River Safari Singapore,5,A much cooler place to visit when there is air conditioner.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Had a great experience at River Safari earlier this afternoon!
Manatees are magnificient!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"We booked the 3pm slot and entered the park around 3pm+. Took the Mandai Khatib Shuttle and it was quite a fast ride. The park was not crowded at all but weather was quite humid. Wanted to catch the Animal Presentation at the Plaza at 430pm but the show hit the full capacity already, probably because of the social distancing since it was just a small area. It was a pity that the Reservoir Cruise activity was suspended till further notice due to the current pandemic, hence there's a small section of the park was missed out. But overall it was a pleasant experience to get close to wildlife again, given it was redeemed using SRV vouchers. It was a quick 2hours spent in the park:)"
River Safari Singapore,4,"The show is a must watch! We had fun at the 2.30pm show.

We went with no expectations so were pleasantly surprised by the sheltered walkways and how there us air conditioning for some of the exhibitions. There's alot of fish before we get to the Pandas.

Go to see the Pandas first before going to the show since walking back and forth would waste your energy!

The Red Pandas were sleeping so we couldn't see it moving but the Pandas were irresistibly cute! Their enclosures are very cooling too since it is air conditioned, definitely favourite part of the whole trip!

We managed to catch the 2.30pm show and it's very fun and informative, recommended to watch it! The staff are very enthusiastic and cheerful, excellent show starters and humourous!

Staff around the park are all very helpful, friendly and polite, thank you for making this whole experience even better!

Was asked to do feedback when exiting the gate and when you completed it they will give you a voucher to redeem a drink of your choice at Inuka Cafe (A large sized drink Worth $3.50)

Bought a panda toy as souvenir at $5.90, it is very cute!

Cons: - Not a lot of toilets so when you see one make good use of it.
- Information boards are mainly in english
- once you crossed to the opposite side via the walkway it would be a hassle to turn back so explore everything on one side first before going to the other.
-Bring your own water if possible. Ice cream in machines are double the price of what is sold outside."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Mostly sheltered. Do not need to worry even is raining.
Squirrel and monkey forest is quite interesting where you can see the animals moving just right in front and around of you.
Not to forget the adorable panda and manatee.
A bit disappointed on the Amazon river quest. The boat moved a bit fast and could not see most of the animal. Maybe i was just unlucky."
River Safari Singapore,5,"It was great! However, the river cruise is closed temporary due to pandemic. We were still able to enjoy the Amazonian ride (top up $5 each for unlimited ride, because there were no queue when we went). The ticket for Amazonian ride can be purchase on the spot."
River Safari Singapore,5,A place to enjoy n have a great time.
River Safari Singapore,5,Good for family trip. Love the themes
River Safari Singapore,3,"Good but due to Covid 19  situation, the  Once Upon A River performance can only accommodate 50 person per session.  Don't understand why they do not increase the frequency of the shows.  It is not fair as many people end up not being able to watch it.  As it is based on first come, first serve, only those who are fast and can waste at least 1.5hr would get to watch the show!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very comfortable and pleasant to visit as many of the attractions are shaded or have AC, an important consideration especially when you have kids. Especially like the squirrel monkey attraction as you can really get up close and personal with them. Have visited a few times and will probably do so again."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Very well managed displays that add a lot of knowledge about river ecosystems around the world. Rich variety of animals, definitely worth a visit.

Most of the park is covered so quite comfortable journey. Went during heavy rain and the key attraction Amazon River Quest was shut down due to weather conditions, so unfortunately couldn't see a portion of the exhibits.

Do note many F&B outlets and shows closed at the moment during phase 2 of CB relaxing."
River Safari Singapore,5,It's a nice one hour + stroll of viewing beautiful reptiles and mammals. 🥰😍
River Safari Singapore,4,"Brought my son for his first time visit to the River Safari. If I'm not wrong, I didn't see any Halal-certified food at this area. Recommended to bring your own foods and drinks! And carpark parking from 1030am to 430pm was $10 - so be prepared to top up your cashcard. 😂 And please wear comfortable clothes and comfortable/sport shoes as you'll be doing a bit of walking."
River Safari Singapore,3,"If you got a choice to visit zoo, river safari or night safari... Consider what you like to see, if panda then only at river safari."
River Safari Singapore,1,"This is not correct!  Afican crocodile trying to eat the poor tortise there!  Please seperate them,  should not put them in the same habitat in River Safari!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"The design of the place is brilliant and made for both sunny and rainy days, since the entire path is sheltered, and there were lots of air conditioned spaces.

Lots of fish, since it’s river-themed. And they’re in the impressive tanks.

We got to meet the pandas. Don’t forget the red pandas at the beginning of the panda exhibit, they’re soooo cute and there was an interactive active one when we were there. And the giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, are so beautiful. We were at Kai Kai’s enclosure ar about 1600, he was awake and full of life, playing with and rolling in the heap of bamboo while he munched in them like they were crunchy biscuits.

At we arrived ar 1629 at the Boat Plaza for the 1630 show.  But it was already full so we had to give it a miss. We never imagined that we had to go early because the rest of the place was practically. Very disappointed but I guess it’s all part of the covid safety regulations.

We had to pay $5 for each adult to get on the Amazon River Quest. To make the money’s worth, and to admire the animals along the way, we took it a few times. Unlimited times is allowed for as long as it’s open. And of course no worries. It was such a nice way to rest legs too.

Was just a little sad for the big fish and sea mammals in the tanks. They really did look bored.

Highly recommended for Singapore residents and tourists alike. It was truly well built and customer centric."
River Safari Singapore,5,Amazing show by the host and animals loads of energy and fun with the audience!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Was sheltered for the most part and the animals are interesting and uncommon, descriptions were good too"
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place for visit with kids and really exciting for nature.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Rain or shine, walking or using something with wheels, River Safari is always a good time to visit. There are exhibitions with cool AC and enclosures with a canopy. It may not be as exciting as the Zoo but my young daughter and I had a blast. The manatee and pandas were our favorite."
River Safari Singapore,5,"It was small but fun! The sea cows were so cute. So sad I went during their breakfast time. They were all busy eating grasses on top.

Most of the places were sheltered, it made visitors felt more comfortable. Went to the boat ride too. Was an interesting experience but the kid behind us was very noise.

Oh yaaa there were pandas too. There were two pandas, one female and one male while the male one was not shy to show the people how he ate. I spent 10 mins looking at him just eating bamboo. At some moment I even suspected it’s a human inside.

Spent 2-3 hours and pretty much explore everything."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Great place to go especially with friends and family, i used the Singapore Rediscover vouchers and had to pay only $2.40 for the ticket, do note that some of the rides inside have to pay extra ($5 per adult) and if you plan to watch the show please queue early cause there is limited seating!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Had a great time with my family :) The staff were helpful and friendly. The Amazon River Quest is the highlight of the trip!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Creatures of the deep, we will never understand the freedom you seek. But I hope that we have created a home that you can live easy.

River Safari is definitely a joy to visit. An abundance of knowledge, fun and beauty.

You dont have to worry about wet or hot weather, it can be enjoyed comfortably.

However note that by-passing the river boat ride ($5) there will be some animals that you will not get to see. Might be a consideration if you want to complete the experience.

Nonetheless, laze with the panda and enjoy the trip out."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to visit with family and kids. It's nice to sit quietly and watch the manatees swim or get up close with the monkeys in the enclosure.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Loves the manatee😍
Not a big place but lots of lovely animals like red panda, panda, monkey looks like squirrel and lion, some lovely freshwater aquarium.
Can easily spend half a day here"
River Safari Singapore,4,Panda was the highlight for me. You can finish River Safari within 3 hours.
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice change from other animals at the Night Safari & zoo. Be sure you check the times for special shows!
River Safari Singapore,5,"It was really nice and fun. I went on a saturday at about 5pm. It was not that crowded, probably due to SMM so restricted number of people allowed.

Will recommed for families especially. I did not manage to get the amazon river, but maybe next time will try"
River Safari Singapore,5,"The aim objective for me is to see the Pandas Jia Jia and Kai Kai. It was ok but not too eventful. The large aquarium tanks with various fishes and sea creatures are intriguing. So if you like sea creatures, river safari is the place to go.
We paid $5 per person to get on the River Quest ride. The ride was too fast for us to properly spot animals and take photos of them. Concept is good but might need to slow down the ride for it to be meaningful."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Nice sheltered walk ways throughout. Due to COVID19, crowd are manageable. There are some construction ongoing but did not hinder much. We bought the boat ride tickets but was not able to take due to child height restrictions. The staff kindly told us that the unused tickets can be used to buy staff at the gift shop"
River Safari Singapore,4,"The family had quite a fun morning visiting the river safari. Managed to see the manatees, howler monkeys, Jia Jia and Kai Kai the two pandas, flamingoes, red pandas and many more.

The show at 1130 am was also quite interesting, especially the acts featuring the capybaras and the pelican.  The boat ride was also pretty nice, and the family behind us managed to go one more round for free as there were not many visitors.

Two issues - better signages are needed - they lead clearly from the carpark to the zoom but then we had to staff to redirect us.  Also, there were quite a number of visitors who walked around with their masks either below their noses, or even not covering their mouths. Though there were safe distancing ambassadors around, they were rather few and far between."
River Safari Singapore,5,Very informative. Great place to bring kids to
River Safari Singapore,5,"First time visiting due to the 50% Singapore Zoo and River Safari adventure combo (valid till 27 Dec for Singapore Rediscovers vouchers). Favorite exhibits were the Red Panda and Manatee. Overall, love that it was a wide showcase of various river animals up close. Thailand's Mekong Giant Cat was extremely memorable! It's not a daily sight to see. Don't think you'll ever get to see these fishes up close and live without diving! Exhibits were very informative and I learnt a lot! Great upkeep WRS! I suggest limiting your time to 2-3 hours if you are looking to cover the Singapore Zoo on a same day visit."
River Safari Singapore,5,"So awesome! One of the best Zoo experiences I've ever had. Well kept animals, not too much to see so you can spend time observing the animals. Lots of animals I've never seen in real life. And the pandas!!! Super highly recommend."
River Safari Singapore,5,It was our first time. It quite fun but its too short to enjoy fully. It would be better if the  river cruise could be open. We heard it has been closed during the circuit breaker. We had never taken this cruise before. It would be wonderful if it could be open to the public again. 😀
River Safari Singapore,5,We always enjoy especially my kids when we are there everytime...
River Safari Singapore,4,Love this place. Love the Manatees. The monkey park is not to be missed. Scooter available for rental for those decided not to sweat it out. Dont forget to take the boat ride
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place to spend 2-3 hours. Well built with shelters and nice exhibits of river safari!
River Safari Singapore,5,The manatees like to eat. The pandas like to sleep. I love the river safari!
River Safari Singapore,4,"Whilst we had an enjoyable first visit on Sunday, we were not totally wowed by river safari. We loved the giant panda’s although this whole section didn’t seem to have a lot else to see. The section next to this was a bit boring for the children with more and more fish. We loved the walk through monkey enclosure. We didn’t see any otters which was a shame as I love otters. No river cruise running due to Covid restrictions but we knew this before arriving. It seems a shame there are extra costs involved to see the animals in that section. One of the most disappointing parts to the visit was the numerous large groups. We didn’t just see one but multiple groups bigger than five members. Maybe some safety ambassadors could approach these groups around the park!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Perfect for family outing. Zero crowd cause we booked and came on a weekday.
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place to visit during the COVID on weekdays as the tourist are not around you can really enjoy the park . Hope the COVID will go away soon .
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great experience! The park was well organised with ample shelter and air-conditioned exhibits spaced out so that we don't get too hot. Very informative with clear signs beside exhibits. Not too wordy, just the right amount of information. Very thematic as well. Do try to catch the show (once upon a river?). It was really well done and entertaining! Highlights for me were seeing the show, manatees, sturgeons, capybaras. I was pleasantly surprised by the information about rivers and the flooded amazons."
River Safari Singapore,5,"very nice place to learn about marine animals. the boat ride was fun too! however, the queue for the giant pandas was extremely long and we did not get to see it."
River Safari Singapore,5,Best educational zoo especially for the curious kids to discover life along the famous rivers.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Love it! River Safari offers much shorter tour than the zoo (~2 hours as the boat rides aren't operational). However, there are many interesting exhibits and cute animals, so it still has a lot to offer.

Kai Kai and Jia Jia, the pandas, were napping when we visited - understandable, though a little disappointing.

The squirrel monkey exhibit area is superb! The Capybaras are soooo cute chasing one another around. A saki monkey whom the zookeeper called Roger was very naughty, wanting to pull the feather of a parrot she brought to the exhibit area. Though admonished, Roger still went for it and got further rebuked! 😂😂

We love the manatees too!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Well design tourist attraction from the weather. The exhibit is educational
River Safari Singapore,5,"My children love here, especially visiting the Pandas. Have to queue for a while just to go in. However, it’s a Very cozy place, a lot of things to see. Loving their big tanks. A very clean place."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Bought the March 1-for-1 promo, so paid $36 for 2 pax, and also $39 for Singapore Zoo. River Safari took us about 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace, while the zoo took us about 3.5 hours.

Loved the air-conditioned panda exhibition! Managed to catch sight of a sleeping red panda in the tree, and the giant panda feasting on some bamboo leaves. The other one was in the inner caged area, so pretty much hidden from view. But this was a lot better than my last visit, where one was not in sight, and the other waiting to be let in into the caged area, and also didn't spot the red panda, too.

Top up an extra $5 each for the Amazon River Quest, a short boat to view a couple of the exhibitions.  There's a couple of monkey species, capybara, giant anteater, tapir, flamingoes, etc. We'd managed to catch sight of most of the animals, except for the jaguars! We failed to catch sight of both the young jaguar (in its own exhibition) and also the parents (in the next exhibition), which was quite disappointing. When exiting from the boat, there's a route that say ""re-ride"", but not too sure if there chargerable.

Loved the Squirrel Monkey Forest! There were quite a few of them within the short walking route (a u-turn) and some other animals, but the monkeys were the highlight. It's like, with every step, you're able to spot one, and they're all so close-up or within arm's reach. There were also 2 macaws!

Oh, right! The River Cruise, that's FOC, is suspended until further notice! That was a sad one. Not really sure why that's suspended, but the Amazon River Quest isn't though."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A great zoo to go too, it is mostly sheltered and has AC at certain parts which is a good thing to have. The animals are also very well kept and look healthy!"
River Safari Singapore,5,nice place n can see both land n water animals..
River Safari Singapore,5,good stuff. about 2 hours up and down without the squirrel monkey and pandas. those 2 have queues >30 minutes. manatees are super cute.
River Safari Singapore,5,"a good place to spend with family, has a collection of amazing fish and water animals. Most of the aquarium is well maintained very clean and has a clear glasses."
River Safari Singapore,4,"It has been 2 years since I've visited River Safari. I was unhappy when my family couldn't get onto the riverboat ride as it was one of the main highlights. It was due to bad weather. Very disappointed. And is a MUST GO AND TRY their Panda Bun that's cost SG$2.90 each. There are 2 flavours, one is Chocolate and the other one is Red Bean. Anyways I can't wait to see the expansion of the whole area in Mandai. Especially the Rainforest Park and the eco-friendly hotel!"
River Safari Singapore,4,I particularly like the panda exhibition which was air-conditioned. Kaikai was feeding itself at the time we came which was around 5.40pm. The massive fish tank with manatees and arowana fish was a sight to behold. Just need to spend an hour to two for this place
River Safari Singapore,3,Too many people crowding at panda enclosure waiting for panda to appear. No social distancing at all. Minimum height is 1.06m to take the boat ride and Families with younger kids may miss part of the safari due to this safety regulations. The actual water visibility in the manatee tank is not as clear.
River Safari Singapore,3,"The facilities were very very clean and beautiful. There were very little animals in this place and are not very unique. Cons is that its kinda boring but the pros are since there aren't many unique and common animals, they must be back in the wild where they belong"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Family friendly place. Most of River Safari is sheltered, making it a much better experience than the Singapore Zoo."
River Safari Singapore,4,Excellent collection of marine creatures. Wonderful experience for little one. They will definitely enjoy Panda areas.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Go for the boat ride! It's the highlight of the place.

Otherwise the whole place is generally nice. Reasonable size with great social distancing measures. Friendly staffs and a good range of animals!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Was a great family day out. We booked for the 11am entry. No need to fight with the crowds and we could explore at a leisurely pace, especially with two 1 year olds running around. The restaurant's food was pretty good and filling. Had the braised beef noodles which was really yummy. Everyone was relatively socially distanced. Apart from the boat ride not happening at the moment, truly enjoyed my time there"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very well-designed, love the river quest."
River Safari Singapore,5,So enjoying with kids at here ... especially the boat ... must try it ..and the Panda Bun...
River Safari Singapore,5,"Perfect for kids, even in very-very hot weather."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Weather was very good today, cooling, not much sun. Anyway River Safari is almost fully covered."
River Safari Singapore,5,Recommended place for especially family with toddlers. More comfortable than Singapore Zoo.
River Safari Singapore,5,It has a very nicely curated group of animals. The place is sheltered and the staff are all friendly and helpful. I have been there many times and each time there is something new to see and observe.
River Safari Singapore,5,"The Amazon Rain Forest boat ride was a nice experience. Not much crowd during these Covid restricted times. Adds to family experience. The veggie sandwich, garlic potatoes and veg spring rolls at the restaurant housed within, are amazingly delicious."
River Safari Singapore,5,The river safari ride was most enjoyable!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Perfect place for my 2yo to be fascinated by wildlife like manatees, stingrays and pandas!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Its amazing the animals and the boat ride made the day memorable
River Safari Singapore,5,It was great! Spent an hour watching jia jia muching on bamboo and slacking away on a sunny afternoon ~ certainly enjoy it!
River Safari Singapore,3,"Too crowded, extreme lack of crowd control and safe distancing.. for both humans and fishes.."
River Safari Singapore,4,Had a great time! Great that it is sheltered and some places had aircon. Enjoyed the exhibits especially the panda area and flooded Amazon area :) We read everything and spent 4 hours. Boat ride /Amazon river quest was so-so. Less than 10minute ride.
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to spend with ur love ones
River Safari Singapore,4,Nice.Relaxing for a short getaway.
River Safari Singapore,5,"It's worth to visit, will recommend to walk two round since the park is not too big, walk another round so that you have more time to explore. Don't forget to visit our panda kai kai & jia jia!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Lovely white and red pandas. Do not go during school holidays if you want to see the pandas and/or preserve your sanity. Manatees were lovely and graceful. The walk through enclosure felt like a replicate of the Singapore zoo's.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Very Educational Trip, alot of interesting informations of the animals and places. Shelters all the way, every spot have fans. A few air-conditioning places, panda's enclosure very cold. Very few toilets. One small restaurant small option of food(very few vegetarian option - like vegetarian sandwiches and buns) and , a snack stall behind the restaurant. A few vending machines for ice cream and drinks paying by card or cash. Alot of resting seats along the way. The whole trip can take around 2 hours or more. Have to pay for Boat trips if interested to take."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to enjoy the day and see many animals in very nice displays. The boat ride is worth it.
River Safari Singapore,5,"An often missed cousin of the Singapre Zoo, it is definitely worth the visit.
More suited for younger kids below 5, as its mostly shaded.
Half a day trip is perfect for the family. Food is available without hassle.
Protip: spray some mozzie spray, bring water bottles for easy top up and be early for the show @ 1130 and 1430hrs.
Clean family fun!"
River Safari Singapore,4,A nice local attraction to visit. The aquariums are awesome and they have one of the biggest fish I ever seen in my life. However this zoological park is quite small and can be completed within an hour.
River Safari Singapore,4,Just walk by river and the panda queue is long. The walk is rather long and boat service is off due to covid. Local described it as sien. The photo is at the end
River Safari Singapore,4,"Went on 15-Aug, booking through online. Many places are sheltered, nice place if u have kids with stroller, so weather is not a concern. During this CB period the river cruise was close which is a bit disappointed. We just lucky enough to see the panda after a tea break at the panda cafe, as unable to meet at the first round so we didn’t gave up and turn back in second time. There is still room to improve..."
River Safari Singapore,4,a great experience. totally worth the money spend. will definitely visit again
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great spot to view many different kinds of animals.

In the same area as the Zoological Park and Night Safari.

Definitely a local attraction for locals and foreigners/tourists.

It is home to the famous Singapore Pandas KaiKai and JiaJia"
River Safari Singapore,5,"River safari is a really chill place to bring a date or have a family outing. Despite being a top attraction in Singapore, the enclosures are nicely distanced from each other, offering an overall breathable experience for you to enjoy your wildlife observation and experience. Pit stops with food and drinks are readily paced out throughout, although they can be pretty pricey. Would suggest bring your own drinks and snacks if you’re on a budget.

The 2 cute pandas are the obvious attractions of River Safari. Watching them laze around in the air conditioned environment can be pretty therapeutic.

The amazon ride was pretty thrilling and brought us really close to many of the animals. The ride was well-paced, giving you time to look and even capture nice photos of the animals :)

The reservoir cruise however, felt very underwhelming. Other than cruising on the reservoir, we didn’t see any animals or learn anything new. As nice and zen as it was, the messaging of the experience could have been articulated better.

Overall, the river safari was a great experience! I would definitely recommend checking them out."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A great day out.  We went on a weekday and there was hardly anyone there.  There is plenty of indoor area and shelter from the weather. Lots of adorable animals. There are the giant river otters, the manatees, monkeys and the red panda. We paid $SGD36 each including extra for the boat ride. Makes me want to do more to preserve nature."
River Safari Singapore,5,"The nice place, many interesting fish, animals, beautiful nature around. Boating is a fun adventure!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Good for holiday and family outings.
River Safari Singapore,5,Enjoy whole day at Singapore Zoo and River Safari... Explore many animal type...
River Safari Singapore,4,"Apart from the attractions, the scenery is underrated."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari has lots to offer both adults and kids. Interactive shows, 2 different rides and great animal exhibits. Today experience was different as my 3 year old wanted to draw the various animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,"The more I visit river safari, the more I enjoyed the place. The intersperse of outdoor and air conditioned enclosures made it comfortable to visit in the hot weather. The manatees are as adorable as dolphins as they swim close to you and do a horizontal spiral turn. Consider turning right at the entrance so you don't follow the crowd at the usual starting point."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very informative and interactive. Can be done within 3 hours, but worth it"
River Safari Singapore,5,This place  looks like a rain forest but it is more wonderful than the rain forest 🐊🐢🐍🐅🐒🦇🐆🦉🦎
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari, the newest addition to Wildlife Reserves Singapore’s portfolio of award-winning parks, is Asia’s first and only river-themed wildlife park. Occupying 12 hectares and developed at S$160 million, the park is home to 400 plant species and over 7,500 aquatic and terrestrial animals representing close to 240 species, including one of the world’s largest collections of freshwater animals.

River Safari aims to inspire visitors to appreciate and protect fragile freshwater ecosystems, and is home to threatened species such as the giant panda, manatee and Mekong giant catfish. These magnificent animals are housed in themed exhibits that mirror iconic rivers of the world from the Mississippi to the Amazon."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Really love this place because can enjoy your day with family. All ages are suitable for this place. The location is quite far out of downtown but transportation to get here is very convenient, so it’s doesn’t matter. The animal was lovely and all cute. The highlight are various; start with Panda zone then river boat also very exciting and end with cutie manatees. All are perfect."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River safari was a nice experience, I tried the night safari too. It was a short ride but very interesting one. I got to see animals up close and the tour guide game very detailed information about them."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Good river themed zoo experience. Also mostly covered, so of the parks associated with singapore zoo this is the best if the weather is wet. Boat ride that goes around animal exhibits is an extra charge."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Compared to the zoo, the River Safari is almost fully sheltered all the way so it is highly suitable for families with small kids. There are exhibition with air-conditioning to cool down and rest with seating areas. Most of the giant fishes exhibtion are impressive. Also good place to go,  if you are not a fan of the Zoo ""smell""."
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice sheltered area. Rain or shine.
River Safari Singapore,5,"The experience was really good! There are a variety of creatures to see and many of them are really cool such as the electric eel, those huge fishes way bigger size than me, etc. The environment are well maintained and it's really cool to see those creatures up close. Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the boat ride as it was suspended. I'm sure it will be awesome too."
River Safari Singapore,5,Fantastic tour. Worth it if visiting the zoo.
River Safari Singapore,5,A great place to visit.
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice seeing the pandas. Unfortunately the ride was closed.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Yes, you will see more animals at the zoo and you will see more fish at the aquarium, but at this park you get to see both land and water animals. I love the fact that most areas are shaded, so you are ok if it's a rainy day and also if it's blistering hot and I think it's particularily good for kids.

Very well managed, all enclosures are manicured and the animals seem content.

Snacks and souvenirs are reasonably priced."
River Safari Singapore,5,Hesitated to visit as I was quite tired after visiting the zoo. Was glad I continued the day with the River Safari. Really amazed by and enjoyed the river life exhibits and the panda enclosure (weekday visit; no queue).
River Safari Singapore,3,Many places closed during my visit around end September. Garden by the bay is certainly more value for money.
River Safari Singapore,5,I had a wonderful experience at the River Safari. It's much smaller area than the main zoo but just as fascinating. It's easy to navigate so it's ideal for kids and the elderly. Everywhere is sheltered. The panda exhibit is a favourite and is air-conditioned. The aquarium at the end where the manatees are is nice and calm experience and a great way to end your visit. Would 100% recommend!
River Safari Singapore,5,"My grandson 's favorite spot, Animals Zoo"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Fun for all ages. We went as a family of 6 includes a senior, a 2 years old, a 7 years old, lots of walking around, so bring a stroller or hire one at the door. We made a mistake of going to the zoo right after lunch break. I suggest spend half a day at the river safari, then come back for another half day at the zoo if you have young kids or elderly. Great show for the little ones that are not tall enough to go on the River quest boat ride."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River safari is a combination of a Bird Park, SEA Aquarium and Zoo. It features a really wide variety of animals, and it is not very crowded as well. You can learn a lot of facts about animals and also see them or even touch them. It is good for families and children. It is also mainly indoors, so rain shouldn’t be a problem except for a few attractions."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Find a wild cat in its “natural” habitat , unbelievable scene to behold. Roar! Splash and off we continue our River journey"
River Safari Singapore,5,Visit this place once every 3 months. Still find it fun for kids to explore. Would love to take the boat rides soon
River Safari Singapore,4,It is super place in Singapore to spend time among trees and free moving animals in River Safari.
River Safari Singapore,4,Have a good time with your family
River Safari Singapore,5,"I rated it the best of the three zoo offering which are the zoo itself, night Safari and River safari. Is you want to see the most animals the Zoo will be your first choice but if you want more relax trip then I will recommend the river safari. Obviously the star attraction are the pandas but what I like is the design of the park which is virtually a loop. So you just walk from one end to the other. The panda enclosure is air conditioned so it's a good relief from the sweltering heat. Additionally you get to see all type of animals including birds, 🐟 and mammals."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Very nice exhibits, however due to the humidity you really get the whole smell-vision experience. Nice animal and fish and water animal exhibits as well. Monkey exhibit was really cool as well."
River Safari Singapore,5,Beautifully Relaxing Park in 🇸🇬
River Safari Singapore,5,"👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I will give more stars if there is"
River Safari Singapore,5,One of a kind zoo where you can enjoy boat rides and look at less typical critters (fishes) not found in other zoos or aquariums.
River Safari Singapore,4,This is a nice man  made place. Where you have to travel by a boat to see around. The ride will last for around 10 minutes. If you love to see animals i recommend this place.  But it is more worth to visit the zoo. Because the journey was not as i expected.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Once Upon A River Show - Fantastic
Had enjoyable time interacting with the amazing animals and birds.
Great amphitheater layout for audience to be in close proximity.
Can run out of space quite fast so do queue early.
Thanks for the lovely experience."
River Safari Singapore,4,"River Safari is a great place for a family outing especially for young families with kids. Kids will love this place especially the pandas and animal show. It is a whole day visit atleast so go prepared by taking food, water and sunscreen lotion :)"
River Safari Singapore,5,Most of the park is sheltered and thus pretty comfortable to take a stroll. Staff are friendly too.
River Safari Singapore,4,Very fun and interesting. Good place for families with children. Many animals to see. A few boat rides to ride. Very long queues for the panda though so I recommend you to go before lunch time.
River Safari Singapore,5,Very well-maintained and managed. Staff have created a great experience for all ages. They were also very attentive and responded quickly when we had a minor medical issue. Great place to spend your Rediscover Vouchers. The Amazon River Cruise is a little short and you are whizzed past the animals rather quickly. Something to bear in mind if you are thinking about going on the ride.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Good multi storey carpark but charges was high. Lots of construction noises but once inside the River Safari compound, all was serene. Lots of fans n shelter around. Water coolers available too. Bring yr own bottles. My favourites were the Pandas enclosures, River Cruise n squirrel monkeys enclosure. Q was fast moving n adequate distancing. Good job, River Safari! A very comfortable experience."
River Safari Singapore,4,"I think the idea of a safari to educate people about conservation is good. However I think more needs to be done for the welfare of some animals.

1. The Stocks and the Herons looked like they have little place to fly around the area. They were just perched in the rain today. When I compared it to what I saw in Sungei Buloh, I was not that glad.

2. Panda looked so afraid of seeing visitors and they would hide near the dens. Red Panda's area looked rather small to move around. I saw the one at Chengdu and it is much bigger and spacious.

3. The Amazon River Cruise was so rushed. I couldn't even have time to snap pictures of the animals as every section is crammed up i.e. I need around 10 secs to snap a picture of an animal before the next one comes up. I saw the space that housed the jaguar and realized it seemed rather small and I worry for its mental health.

4. The tank seemed rather small to house that many manatees. They were swimming around and around. I hope they would blocked out some parts of the tank to give the manatees privacy to hide away from the visitors. They should also not let people go so close to the tanks as children banging the tanks can caused the manatee to be frightened. Hope they build some form of barricade.

Other exhibits like the crocodile, freshwater stingray and salamander were well taken care. Most of the tanks were rather spacious for the fish and turtles to swim in too. It was an enjoyable trip."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great place so many fish and the star of the show was the panda. They were phenomenal and we had a great time. Short but enjoyable. In the panda enclosure that was air-conditioned by the way, and the panda was looking at everyone. I took some great photos. And sure we will come back to visit the 2 Pandas again in the near future!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Well run zoo that focuses plenty on river wildlife and two panda that don’t really fit into the theme. You’ll need about 2 hours to walk through this area, best paired with the night safari or the zoo.

The animals are well taken care of and you’ll come really up close due to the way it’s designed. My family from japan loved it !"
River Safari Singapore,5,Very nice place if you are into river monsters.. I love this more more than zoo or rws aquarium. This is amazing and easy for the trip. Very much worth it and will be going again sometime soon.
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to visit.. very informative. Plus rain or shine you still can move around
River Safari Singapore,4,Awesome visit. Place is really clean and organised. A pity River Safari charge $5 for a separate 10 mins boat ride so just you see more animals.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Compared to the Singapore Zoo, River Safari is easier to navigate (there is effectively only one route) and needs a shorter time to go through. It is essentially a zoo and an aquarium combined into one, based on various rivers that can be found in the world.

Due to the nature of having glass panes to house most of its exhibits, it is not easy to capture photographic memories.

Other than the exhibits, there is a hands on station where you can hold various marine creatures like starfish and such. There is also a reservoir cruise at no extra charge on which you can learn a bit more of the history of the Mandai Zoo area."
River Safari Singapore,4,Lovely place. Glad I had the opportunity to visit when there weren't crowds of people around. Disappointed that the boats were in operation though.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Nicely done and presented. Adequate amount of info, especially for kids."
River Safari Singapore,5,Been there several times and every experience is different
River Safari Singapore,5,"Coming to River Safari was fantastic with family and friends. Fortunately for us, there was a short rain in the afternoon that lasted for 15 minutes. However, the sheltered walkways in the zoo helped us avoid most of the rain.

We loved looking at both the land and sea creatures! The manatees were astonishing to look at and take pics. There is also Kai Kai and Jia Jia in the panda zone, where many people were impressed.

The boat ride featured different types of animals, and it felt as if we were on a theme park water attraction."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Happy to see the pandas, attended the animal shows and for the river adventure. Sad that the river tour was cancelled cos of COVID. Hope to go for the tour when COVID improves. Highly recommended to visit the animals in indoor condition."
River Safari Singapore,5,Really awesome zoo.  Unique experience with animals from the water. A boatride is included in the ticket. It was really good.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Although I've went to the zoo many times. This is my first time to the river safari. Compared to the zoo, the safari is a detailed route with sheltered paths. My toddlers thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely come again!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"A great addition to the zoo. Its surely better than the zoo, as there are lots of shelter areas and more structured direction in where things are. Better with kids."
River Safari Singapore,5,"So amazing when there is almost nobody around. No queues, just peace and quiet except for the occasional kid. The animal presentation was unimpressive if ur an adult and its not your first visit to the zoo. I'd skip it as there will always be a queue for that, I waited 40 mins despite it being a non school holiday Wednesday afternoon during covid, and I barely even saw many people roaming around."
River Safari Singapore,5,We love going to River Safari. It's always calm and can make a quick trip. Amazing Amazon boat ride. Short but sweet.
River Safari Singapore,5,Very spacious!
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari is Singapore's latest wildlife-themed park that is tailored around the majestic river ecosystems of the world. Their main attractions are The Amazon Quest, Amazon Flooded Forest, Giant Panda Forest and Reservoir Cruise."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari is a fresh & combined platform to discover some rare species of fishes and wildlife, brought from all around the world..special attraction are Giant Pandas and Red Pandas of course...also you can observe and experience different Rivers around our planet with their inhabitant details, River cruise, Amazon River quest boat ride, some live animal show, massive S.E.A aquariums and many more..

For the first time I came across anacondas, Electric Eel & Piranhas here ..

Moreover, there are some friendly staff, have seen care takers ( seems they are school kids) cleaning the tanks from outside as well inside..must learn from them the way taken care of the wildlife..
Highly recommend place in Singapore, less crowded than zoo and night Safari by less covering time."
River Safari Singapore,5,"It’s hard to find a park in Singapore where you can completely avoid the oppressive heat. Surprisingly River Safari proved me wrong. You will be able to walk in sheltered or AC comfort while admiring the exhibits. Another thing I appreciated about the River Safari was the proximity of the animals- the pandas were the closest ever seen compared to many zoos. So much better to appreciate their cute antics at close range without a glass window. Besides the panda exhibit, the squirrel monkey exhibit was also very interesting. If you are planning to visit all 3 parks, go to the River Safari in the afternoon."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Best place to chill out with kids and family, especially the Amazon Rainquest.

Carry some snacks and easy to carry luggage.
For sure go for Mandai River boat ride."
River Safari Singapore,5,Walks are sheltered. Many exhibits are air conditioned. Close encounters with monkeys.
River Safari Singapore,4,Popular with famillies with small kids.. crowded due to singaporediscover. It's the river version of the SEA aquarium
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very well done this place. There are a lot of places to walk, and have a lot of fun with the kids. We had a good walk around the area. Also, the Panda enclosure is a lot of fun with a lot of people just looking and taking photos."
River Safari Singapore,5,"To go to river safari, you need to go by bus and the earliest bus will come from 9 am. River safari also adjacently near singapore zoo. River safari is better cause it in house and have multiple fish over the world, specificially there is a couple of panda"
River Safari Singapore,5,You should consider buying amazon river quest tickets. It was amazing.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Good variety of species on all different rivers across globe. It is well planned and well maintained. The bridge over the river which is rest area as well, is really nice to sit with friends and family and rest. The small boat ride is also enjoyable, almost no rush to get into the boat.You can again see some of the animals of the zoo which were interior side and you missed in zoo. A really great concept"
River Safari Singapore,5,Loved it! Never knew rivers could hold such large animals in their bosoms. Hats off to the people who built and maintain the treasured collection. My rating 4.8!
River Safari Singapore,4,"Before going must remember to book your slots online or else may not be able to go in. Made use of the Rediscover vouchers and bought a combo of river safari & zoo. Spent half a day at river safari and the other half in the zoo. River Safari is better as you can see the panda bears and the performance is so much better than the zoo, mainly because it is in a small stage set up, so you can see the performance better."
River Safari Singapore,5,You have to pre book a time slot before going. We went at 4pm. There was less crowd. We saw both pandas. Kai kai was sleeping and jia jia was walking around. My boys enjoyed their time.
River Safari Singapore,5,Good for 3 hours of kids entertainment.
River Safari Singapore,5,"It's a very good zoo that is river themed and it's very organised, each zone for each important river.  But I feel that the Mary river and the Ganges river could be longer."
River Safari Singapore,4,We enjoyed our first time to river safari. You can feel the effort and thoughts put into the design of the river-themed park.  The walk to the various river adventures was very enjoyable especially on the enclosed area where you get to see the animals around you up close. Do take note the river-themed park only opens at 10Am unlike the zoo that opens at 830.
River Safari Singapore,5,"An absolutely fabulous little Zoo. Big enough to spend a few hours. If the river boat ride is not included as part of your ticket, I would probably recommend that you do not do it. There really is nothing to see, but it is a good place to sit for 15 minutes and watch the world go by. The giant panda exhibit is wonderful, as too, many of the massive aquariums that they have. I would thoroughly recommend visiting the River Safari."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Love the indoors/outdoors mix. There is a lot of good exhibits. There is an entrance fee, then you are in, have a walk around and a quaint cafe inside. Also, an outdoor river cruise on electric boats. Very fun for my children, and they got so excited."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Been here for the 3rd time.This year i brought my whole family and their kids. there were few animals that were not there anymore. Like the polar bear (died already). No more otters, sea lion (maybe they're dead too?) The experienced we had was not like before where the zoo and safari were full of animals.

I really loved the taste of the siopao."
River Safari Singapore,1,"It is a fantastic place with all the exotic animals and wild life. Due to the rain, our boat ride got to be cancelled, although payment has been made. And that was after queuing for an hour. We were told we can redeem our tickets in the eating outlets and there is no refund.  We went to a shop near the entrance to buy some snacks. When we passed the tickets for redemption,  we were told the tickets have been used and we can't redeem. This is really frustrating! We have been in this snack shop for half an hour and the staff still cannot solve the problem!  Poor customer service! The name of the shop is The Wild Mart. In the end, the staff told us there is nothing they can do. My word of advice to those who visit River Safari, pay attention to the weather forecast before taking boat rides. My family of 4 paid $20 for the boat ride. My donation to River Safari, maybe this is the way they earn money."
River Safari Singapore,5,Well structured zoo which you could walk and complete in about 2.5 hours. Take the Amazon River Quest ride which requires an additional ticket.  Backwater ride is free and could be skipped if you are short of time. The manatee enclosure is great and kids would thoroughly enjoy this.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very nice place to see those big creature that live in River. Didnt know river can have such big creature living in it. Sheltered all the way. So if rain cant go to zoo, this will be a good choice."
River Safari Singapore,5,River safari is a part of the 4 parks offering the sighting of animals in close to their natural surroundings. The safari is done in a boat which is lifted to a higher level by a lift and then goes downstream in flowing water. The animals can be seen in the open. The whole experience is good and comfortable.
River Safari Singapore,5,It is amazing amazing full of wildernesses amazing for animal lovers wildlife photographers. They are even famous for their pandas which are so amazing and cool
River Safari Singapore,3,Brought wheel chair bound Grandma to the River Safari recently but she was not allowed to enter one of the enclosures with her wheelchair. So she had to stay outside while we quickly made our way in to have an upclose encounter with the monkey. Could not attend live show because of limited seating capacity - perhaps can make the show shorter and more frequent at the weekend?
River Safari Singapore,3,"If there is no long queues you can complete complete everything within 2 hours. We went on a public holiday and there was a queue almost took half an hour on both rides. So better avoid holidays as both rides are actually around 15 minutes and I really think it is not worth to queue for long time.

Honestly for me nothing much exciting here. I would rather allocate more time for Singapore Zoo rather visit here."
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice experience but wasted not able to take boat ride due to lighting. Food is tasty & worth it.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Incredible. Perhaps the best Zoo and Eco-Park on the planet! You are right there in the nature of the local wildlife and jungle, yet clean and safe."
River Safari Singapore,5,"I needed time to wait to see the pandas.
I went on a rainy day, so I had a good time without being hot."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Not the first time i have been there, if you are more interested in aquarium fish like me, you would really enjoy the experience. But the really big stingrays and aropaimas  are awesome to see even for the rest of the other people. Overall would be boring though for the non fish geek"
River Safari Singapore,5,"How amazing it is to travel around the world in 2 hours? This is what it feels like going to River Safari. The concept of rivers around the world is very educational and fun with its related animals and enviroment.

This is a good way to spend time with family and friends."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A large variety of river side/aquatic animals to see also the whole park is under cover so there is no need to worry about a rainy day there is also 2 rides the ""Amazon safari"" which is around a 5 minute boat ride to show the animals that live in the Amazon and the ""river side cruise"" which takes you around the river to see elephants, giraffes and if your lucky other animals too. This park is a very family friendly park not only for the rides but the shows as well which you'll need to be quick since it fills up quickly.

Overall a very fun experience a must see if your touring around singapore."
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice experience. One who loves nature should visit river safari in singapore
River Safari Singapore,5,"It was peaceful and we managed to see many more animals up close like the squirrel monkeys and different types of fish. We were lucky enough to see the manatees being wash and cleaned at the same time as well as an otter that was sunbathing in the sand.

The red pandas were adorable marking their territories by leaving per marks and shaking their small booties! Here's a sneak!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"My family loved the boat ride. Animals on both sides of the river,  boat slowly moving down the river. Highly recommend it."
River Safari Singapore,5,Quite nice.
River Safari Singapore,5,Not too many people visit during this time meaning can enjoy all the creatures without too many people taking photos.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Singapore River Safari is definitely a must go experience. Almost all of the park is either air conditioning or under covered walkways. You'll find variety of animals, sea creatures and many more including Pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia. The Amazon River Quest is actually a boat ride which is fun though it's a little short and what I understand is, you can take the rides as many times as you like and of course you have to queue up for your turn. A perfect place for a day to enjoy with the kids. You'll love the beautiful scenery."
River Safari Singapore,3,"Not interesting because the 10 minutes ride basically I only see 3 miserable monkey. The ride definitely needs to be improved, or just make it free."
River Safari Singapore,5,Take a 2 hour shady walk through this well organised famous river-themed zoo. Some interactive displays are put up for you to touch and feel the living organisms and animals. Panda-theme cafe serves food at midpoint. Amazon river boat ride which costs $5 is interesting and enjoyable but you may not spot all the animals as the boat slides past them rather quickly.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great Attraction for Everyone, especially for kids. Highly recommend this Zoo."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Thumbs up for such a place!! We had a great experience at the river safari, definitely not something to be missed. There is a wide variety of animals to see. The boat ride itself is a fun way to see the different animals by trying to spot them as you go."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Panda Love!!  We love  the  cute and cuddly Pandas and never miss an opportunity to meet them at the  River Safari. Its a wonderful place to see the sea life  from fishes to crocodiles and turtles.
Little ones are sure the enjoy the whole day  watching the  sea creatures and Panda. :)"
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice sheltered walkways with clean nursing rooms. Biodata was clearly laid out and easy to read and understand. Children will have a very enjoyable time.
River Safari Singapore,4,"The place seems to look better than what I remember a few years back. The River Quest is nice, just a little short or the boat was moving too fast for us to catch sight of animals.
It seems the giant otters (they're found near the Safari exit)  take naps around noon so if you want to see them in action, maybe aim for early morning or late afternoon.
Numbers limited for the animal shows, so you need to be there early too to catch them."
River Safari Singapore,3,This is an average place. I would recommend to skip this one if you plan to visit S.E.A. Aquarium.
River Safari Singapore,5,Much better then the zoo..
River Safari Singapore,5,"Located just beside the Singapore Zoo, The River Safari is the newest wildlife park in Singapore which offers exhibits featuring various river habitats that can be found throughout South East Asia. Look forward to some of the monster sized fishes, snapping turtles, alligators, otters, pythons, a whole lot of aquarium set ups and of course, Pandas!

A must go place for freshwater aquarium lovers!

There is also a station where visitors can touch and feel starfishes and shoe crabs.

The park is mostly sheltered.

Water coolers can be found at toilet points all around the park. Do remember to bring your own bottles!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Beautiful and educational. Well designed
River Safari Singapore,5,Very nice place for the kids
River Safari Singapore,4,"Good value for money. Some endangered species, such as Panda and Manatees are there to watch."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Lovely place with lovely manatees. My girl loves it. We took a slow 2-3 hr stroll, taking pix & sketching. Plus a light snack at the panda cafe. Kai kai the male panda was rather active & even posed for pix.  River Safari is quite manageable for preschool kids & elderly."
River Safari Singapore,5,"The River Safari is a must see if you are in Singapore. It was well set out and is an easy walk around the park to see all the exhibits.

The Panda exhibit is fantastic and was the highlight of our visit. The girls loved all the animals and also the river safari ride."
River Safari Singapore,5,One of my fav place aside the zoo & night safari. I go almost every month & also a member there. Cannot relay my experience & feel as you have to go there yourself. All 3 zoos are very well maintained & the animals are well-kept & healthy.
River Safari Singapore,4,It was a nice experience at River Safari. The boat ride especially was a god experience. It had a wide variety of water creatures with unique viewing experiences. The aquarium is built beautifully showcasing the fishes.
River Safari Singapore,5,"this place is mainly sheltered, and it has a very big aquarium."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Enjoyed the park with the boat ride and panda exhibition. However, the animals are quite limited. Quite a nice way to spend a few hours."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Love here alot!!! Never thought I will love zoo so much. You will fully explore the biggest river ecological system in the world here, including Yangtze River, Mekong river, Amazon river...etc, by walk for BOAT!!! The trip was really good and highly recommend for all of the tourists and even parents."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Enjoyed this zoo quite a lot. Loved the red panda enclosure.

This was a lot better than main zoo and night Safari. Good variety of displays and animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,"It's all about sea life. You get to see sea life from different regions in the world. Away from sea life, you can see pandas and jaguar (we didn't see the jaguar). Some areas are inside and some outside. Buy it online to get 5% discount."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place for children to learn about the river.
River Safari Singapore,4,at least 30mins for panda🤪
River Safari Singapore,5,Amazing. A must visit. Simply awesome
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place for family outings.
River Safari Singapore,5,Zoo and aquarium in one location!
River Safari Singapore,4,"Generally, a pretty well planned out safari. Animal exhibits are relatively interesting and well designed. I like how the journey through the Safari makes a round back to the entrance/exit, navigation is hardly an issue.
The ambience is great and full extent of Mandai’s natural elements are leveraged which adds to the experience and view.
However, the offerings are relatively limited in comparison to the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. I do not think it’s worth a trip just for the River Safari - best to visit the parks as a package. It’s better value for money.
I recommend visiting during the off peak periods (midweek?) so that the queue into the panda conservatory is not too long. Otherwise, you will be spending a majority of your time at the Safari queuing.
Overall: great attraction and nothing wrong with the place. Only lacking in value for money."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great place to bring kids ~ lots of things to see and learn, rare instances where kai kai is out"
River Safari Singapore,4,"The River Safari is a river-themed zoo and aquarium located in Singapore. It is built over 12 hectares and nestled between its two counterparts, the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari, Singapore. It is the first of its kind in Asia and features freshwater attractions and river boat rides as its main highlights. River Safari is Asia's first and only river- themed wildlife park inspired by the world's most iconic rivers."
River Safari Singapore,4,Great exhibits. Especially that most are covered. But not so much to see. Dugong exhibit is still good. Especially for the large water residents
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place to spend day with family
River Safari Singapore,5,"Mini roller coaster ride. Sheltered, mostly. It is really built along a river."
River Safari Singapore,4,"There are various freshwater fishes and some animals that can be found here. The area is just next to the Singapore Zoo, hence is easily accessible to visitors looking for more.
Also included is a boat ride along the reservoir which is a relaxed and informative ride.
Visitora can pay extra for the amazon river quest which is another boat ride. There are various facilities present here for the convenience of tourists."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Main attraction is Giant Panda. Over all it's OK, but if but when we gone to amazon river quest kids enjoyed that ride very much and they still cherishing that. So come here only if kids are with you they will enjoy here more"
River Safari Singapore,4,It's a small but serene attraction. Love the walks and river safari boat ride. Do note that the rides close at 6pm although you may still walk around river safari until 7pm. Panda enclosure will close before 7pm as well. So do go earlier.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Visiting river safari for the first time, cleanly maintained by the government. friends employees who guided well on how to and where to go next. Entry fee for river safari is $32 Singapore dollar. they have seperate place for aquarium, panda and other animals. totally good place to visit with children on a weekend."
River Safari Singapore,4,Could not see many of animals. Good for kids. Appreciate SNG string drinking water. Hope those boats are battery driven.
River Safari Singapore,1,"River safari was suspended due to rain and lightning and never looked like it was going to start even after waiting for half an hour. It was very disappointing. There was no indication of the possibility of a refund. There was a board which said we can see 85 percent of the animals on foot which is what we ended up doing. There was no warning that this would happen and no suggestion to do the river safari first keeping this outcome in mind. They can easily fix this by selling tickets near the boat. But the idea here seems to be to take people's money whether they get the Safari or not. So, best thing to do would be to go to River Safari first or buy the tickets for this only just before going to it. Even then this outcome can not be ruled out. The animals were not that great viewed on foot."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Amazing experience with the Giant Pandas and Amazon Flooded Forest. Definitely a must in Singapore.
Didn't have any chance to do the Zoo, and Night Safari because of lack of time."
River Safari Singapore,5,Overall a great experience. We paid extra to get on the Amazon River Quest boat ride to see some animals that were not featured elsewhere in the park like the capybara and guanaco but the boat ride went too fast. Felt like it should be slower to enjoy the animals. Pandas and squirrel monkey enclosure and the huge tanks were definitely the highlights of the park.
River Safari Singapore,5,Very nice place.  Will visit again.
River Safari Singapore,5,"This is a MUST-DO activity whilst in Singapore.

More than a zoo, the river safari takes you through some of our planets most shaving fresh-water habitats.

The giant pandas are the highlight of the experience which also has a relaxing river boat cruise (with giraffes and rhinos), a monkey exclosure and sea otters!!

Can't recommend more!!!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great place, great exhibits. Would recommend"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Went there on a rainy day, the place is mostly sheltered so no need umbrella.

Also got a very good pic of the manatee.

Very satisfied."
River Safari Singapore,5,amazing experience! You get to be close to uncaged animals and there is plenty to see. I will definitely come back here again the next time I visit Singapore.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very informative and interesting, I've never had the chance to see a Red Panda till now! :)"
River Safari Singapore,4,Been here before and enjoyed the park. I highly recommend booking through an agent as you can get a package and it's so much cheaper. They pick you up from your hotel and drop you off. You also don't have to que for a taxi.
River Safari Singapore,3,"Good. But not as good as the actual zoo, even though it’s more expensive.

Best bits are the monkey enclosure and the pandas. Not quite sure how they’re in a river safari 🤷🏻‍♂️

The boat trip which is included is, quite frankly, not worth it. You see nothing and only get a prerecorded brief history of the river safari.

I didn’t do the adventure boat trip - which appears to be the must-do 🙈"
River Safari Singapore,3,"Make sure the Amazon River Quest ride is available before buying ride passes!! It was down the entire day and we weren't told when the tickets were bought at the counter, but then informed after we reached the entrance to the ride 20 minutes later. Most of the more popular animals are shown on that ride. Skip the reservoir ride. It's a 15 minute loop around a small area of the reservoir  which offers only a brief glimpse of the giraffes at the main zoo if you're lucky and not much else. Of all the animals on display, our favorite was the manatee exhibit. The polar bear is not around anymore, and there wasn't much else that stood out about this park."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Went here with zero expectations but to my surprise, I enjoy river Safari more than the Zoo! I love the idea of the “linear” exploration concept and the animals here are great too! Especially the manatees."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A great place to use your SGRediscovers voucher if you haven't already, and I highly recommend it for a family outing especially if you have young children. It's almost completely sheltered but please do check the weather before booking as rainy weather will result in the temporary suspension of many of their attractions such as the boat rides etc."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Connected to Singapore Zoo. Mostly covered walkway with exhibits. Take time to walk, observe and read the description. Overlooking the upper Seletar reservoir. Scenic and green. Nice place to come with family and kids. If you need some zen time, this is one nice place to hang out. KFC, Ben and Jerry and Starbucks are here. Wow!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Tanks in my opinion much better than the aquarium, exhibits were very interesting.  Only downside was the river cruise which is 15 minutes of driving in a loop, I would recommend the ride further on. But apart from that a great park."
River Safari Singapore,4,"want to see a panda? go go go!
quite relaxing place to stay a day or a half of day!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Good place to hang out with the kids. To be honest I like the zoo more than river safari, but it’s much cheaper to buy the tickets for all four different parks."
River Safari Singapore,5,Definitely a must go places in Singapore. Full of unusual animals and creepy crawlies to see. Such an eyes opening family friendly places.
River Safari Singapore,4,"You will feel like you’re in aquarium.
Children under 106cm will not allow to ride Amazon boat and it cost 5$ for adult and 3$ for child.
You have to manage your time, you need 1:30 to 2:00 hours inside maybe more"
River Safari Singapore,4,Nice place to get in touch with nature and animals on a weekend.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Super fun experience.  Loved the rides, splashings, jerks and many more. Fantabulous routes. Best time with family, memorable rides. Go for it! Very brilliantly made ideas, felt like was in actual forest. Great ideas, very organized. Souvenir are just awesome. Capturing the moments it's an add on, can be purchased if you wish to take back the moments home. Singapore rocks!!

Rain coats are available at the venue, they are super cool too!"
River Safari Singapore,4,Singapore does a really great job with its zoos. The River Safari has some amazing things. The boat ride seems a little too short for all of the hype that walking all the way to it builds up for you. But the quality of the information as you are walking around and some of the tank exhibits are truly astounding. I think it would be a shame if you came to Singapore and didn't make it to the River Safari. Oh.. and they have Pandas...
River Safari Singapore,5,"I enjoyed this riverine park, that allows me to have close encounters with freshwater ecological system and their habitats.  I am fascinated with the parks use of natural ventilation, light and cool walk ways. A great park to visit for educational awareness of freshwater ecosystem through different part of the world."
River Safari Singapore,5,It was amazing!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Visit in the weekend is the best. Reach there at 1100h, able to walk through the whole park twice. Solo trip is fine, a little. Awkward when I'm taking the river cruise alone but still have fun nonetheless."
River Safari Singapore,3,"Living in the bustling city such as Singapore, it is nice place to come with your friends and family once in a while to get in touch with this side of nature and learn about the other living things that are in this world. I though that the most interesting lesson was how the different big rivers in the world are so important in the life system of not only the animals but people as well."
River Safari Singapore,5,super good it's absolutely worthwhile visiting
River Safari Singapore,4,"Great closeup with animals!
Take note of show timings and touch pool!
The information is not really available publicly."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A wonderful and unique place taking one on a journey down the major rivers around the world .Well laid out and organised, but I would recommend tourists to try and avoid public holidays and weekends. Its a great concept and it incorporates an aquarium and a zoo in one.  Plus did i mention Pandas!!"
River Safari Singapore,4,Unique experience walking around watching the biodiversity found in rivers around the world. River cruise was not operating on our visit day otherwise it would have been a 5* rating.
River Safari Singapore,5,Real zoo in Asia. You can see the animals in open side well maintained and very clean.  Best attraction is the white tiger 🐅
River Safari Singapore,5,"Exceeded my expectation. Definitely worth a visit, probably combined with the Zoo or Night Safari."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Nice place to bring family for learning about River Habitats. You may see animal like Monkey, Panda, many kind of Fish, Dugong and etc. Don't forget to try there boat cruise. I have meet their mermaid show at 2pm near Dugong area."
River Safari Singapore,5,Love the Yangtze zones!!! The Manatees were really cute! Also very surprised to see so many people still visiting on the rainy day 😅 I guess it's all thanks to the tsum tsum collab!
River Safari Singapore,5,Great new feature for the Wildlife Reserves in Singapore. Definitely should be included in any visit to the Singapore Zoo or the Night Safari. Substantially different from them both to be a stand alone attraction.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Such a wonderful experience and day out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Make sure you do the ride as it's a great way to see the Jaguars, but heads up, it is a short ride"
River Safari Singapore,5,River great tourist experience for me. I love it ... bit expensive tickets for foreign peoples... 😮
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice trip this CNY 2019 with my friends. Peaceful pace and very nice attraction that they have
River Safari Singapore,4,Loved the experience with my two and a half year old son! River Safari takes 2 hours max and the key attraction is the Pandas!:)
River Safari Singapore,4,Enjoyed the walk in the biodiversity and sparked thoughts about the real problems that our animal friends are facing now.  Could have more info boards though.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Went there on my birthday with my friends and enjoyed myself over there.

The last time I visited River Safari was around 5-6 years ago. I am very thankful that the place has been well-maintained like before.

Recommendation for the visitors who want to visit there:
1. Visit on a weekday as it will not be that crowded as weekends.
2. Take the amazon boat ride as it’s worth it!
3. The food over there is around the same price as the food in Orchard, unless low in budget, else would recommend to have a lunch over there!"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Its never felt bored or tired. I visited the place many a times, but feels refreshed every time. It is always clean and cool.

Animals are all well kept. Panda Couple is the main thing to watch. They are really cute. Female Panda is somewhat shy.

Fish lovers must visit the place. They are gonna love it. Take part in animal feeding, you will really enjoy it."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Lives up to its reputation! Adjoins the Singapore Zoo. I visited the zoo a day earlier so was a bit jaded, but the River Safari really helped freshen us up. Exhibits are excellent. Highlight are Kai Kai and Jia Jia, the 2 pandas. Their story about journey to Singapore Zoo was an eye opener. If you are a nature lover, interested in information about major Rivers in  the world, this is the place for you."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Need to ensure the time slot chosen is not fully booked. 10am slots are the least crowded. River Cruise is suspended. River Animal show timings 11.30am, 2.30pm. Need to start queuing for it at least 1 hour 30mins prior for weekends. Or else you'll miss the show."
River Safari Singapore,5,An excellent park for a haft-day visiting
River Safari Singapore,4,Unique river theme safari. And had housed two giant panda as well. It is more shady then the Zoo next door. Worth a visit.
River Safari Singapore,4,"A good place to see the different types of animals from different rivers of the world. Huge variety of fish to birds, monkeys, jaguar and others. loved the aquarium. Go see the baby manatee, the 2 pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia. The place is mostly sheltered so it's easy to walk the park without getting burned by the sun. Good to bring your own food and drinks as it can be very expensive there."
River Safari Singapore,4,Well set out but the extra charge to see a large part of the zoo (via a ride) is a bit of a cheek. The manatee exhibit is beautiful as are a number of others such as the Mekong River tank. Animals are clearly well cared for.
River Safari Singapore,4,Fun and educational overview of river ecosystems around the world and the importance of limiting negative human impact to the environment. The Amazon River Quest gives you a closeup of Amazon animals and you can ride again if you didn’t see any animals the first time around. Air-conditioned panda exhibit allows you to see these cute fur balls up close.
River Safari Singapore,3,The first part is very interesting with a lot of explanations about nature and animals. The disappointment was the part on the river because I could see only few animals and they were far. They should improve it. But it was a nice experience.
River Safari Singapore,3,"Many things to see, beautiful enclousures and interesting range of animals. Although the boat ride was quite disappointing... 1) main animal (jaguar) was nowhere in sight 2) the boat moved a little too fast to absorb what i was looking at. Otherwise, a good experience. Friendly customer services. Food a little pricey, but then again it's a Singapore tourist attraction lol they be sucking our wallets dry."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Less things to see than the zoo, but more comfortable experience"
River Safari Singapore,5,A family friendly and educational journey about the marine life in various water ecosystems around the world.
River Safari Singapore,5,"For me the River Safari was the highlight of trip to the zoo's in Singapore. We did not get to the Bird sanctuary though.

The tanks are amazing and I saw animals I did not know existed. It was very well set out and the small river cruise was different."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Much smaller compared to zoo, almost fully covered so easy to walk around even if it's raining."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Love love love River Safari! Well designed, friendly staff and quite a good number of exotic animals and fishes to see. Love the reservoir view, which is extremely calming for busy city dwellers. Completed the walk in 2hrs feeling rejuvenated. Excited for another trip to River Safari again."
River Safari Singapore,4,Very nice place touch nature. Only thing is difficult to get food with aircon.
River Safari Singapore,5,"A park that is sure to please any aquatic life enthusiast with a nicely curated collection of all manners of fresh water marine flora and fauna!

Perhaps one of the most famous/infamous attraction would be the Giant Panda exhibit - they have been trying to get Kai Kai and Jia Jia to mate for years, to little avail and some amusement.

The reservoir cruise was a little crowded but overall a nice ride for the little ones. Spend a few more dollars ($5 for adults; $3 for kids) and go on the Amazon River Quest - a nice additional attraction with more sights to see, think monkeys, flamingoes and even jaguars!

Get up close and personal to some squirrel monkeys too. We got lucky as we visited during feeding time and you'll be amaze at their speed and agility. End your visit with a tranquil tour of a large aquarium housing some humongous sturgeons and manatees!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"First visit here - I've been to the zoo and night safari many years ago. The river safari is pretty impressive for a man made freshwater park - set in a natural environment. I spend a lot of time in the wild and I still enjoyed this place, just don't set your expectation way too high and you'll be okay to spend around 2 hours here with the family. The Amazon river ride is fun but kinda short. Try not to go around midday as most of the animals will probably be napping. Early or later parts of the day will probably be better."
River Safari Singapore,5,"A lot of sea creatures are there from important rivers, river cruise (for free) and Amazon river quest (ticket for S $5 and can ask for the second round) are very enjoyable and refresing!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Quite interesting, but a lot depends on weather. We didn't have boat trip because of the rain. Better go there early in the morning as rains usually happen in the afternoon.
Crocodile and huge turtle impressed me most. Pandas are very sleepy)."
River Safari Singapore,4,A differently themed zoo that features the river ecosystem. Was hoping to see more education materials on the threats to these precious river habitats that are destroying lives in and along these life-giving rivers.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Our family's first visit after covid lockdown, glad to see the park is still in a fairly good shape. There were less animals especially in the reptile section, and the ongoing construction work also affected the overall scenery."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great tourist spot!
River Safari Singapore,5,"River safari is great for young children. Its indoor and air conditioned. So its great alternative to the zoo when it raining. Noticed they allowed free complimentary entrance to the river safari for people who bought zoo ticket since it was raining heavily.However, im not sure if they do it frequently or rarely.

The River Safari is also educational for children who are older as they can observe and learn more about the different animals around the world too.

Do stop by the Panda Exhibit and say Hi to Kai Kai and Jia Jia the pandas when you are here!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Eye opening! Must get a multi zoo tickets to cover both zoo and river safari. Suggest 3hour for thorough journey in river safari.
River Safari Singapore,5,Very good exhibits and fantastic landscape
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice escape/back up from rain and hot weather when you go to zoo.
River Safari Singapore,5,Interesting place to visit.. Love the river cruise.. Even though it's only 15mins..its kinda relaxing..
River Safari Singapore,5,Good place to go for family and couple
River Safari Singapore,5,"Great experience, seems like somewhere kids would enjoy a lot."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Loved it, especially the manatees and the giant otters. Needs time: to walk both sides (Amazon River side and Nile River side) (covered open air walkways; they protect you from rain and sun, but not humidity) and take the ""Amazon boat ride"" (extra 5 Sing dollars) took a few hours."
River Safari Singapore,3,"The park gives an interesting overview of the ecosystems of the worlds biggest rivers. However most of the fish species and animals are already present in the Singapore zoo, so a same day visit may feel repetitive."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Clean ,fun and amazing experience with hubby and young kid"
River Safari Singapore,3,"Nice place, the river tour with the boat is to short and i was not able to see anything wich was special."
River Safari Singapore,4,"River safari is good experience which only runs for 15-20 minutes which is called amazon river safari and boats floats via certain track and get to see some monkeys, Flemingos , Deers and exclusive birds. However you get a chance to see many types fishes like eels, catfishes , turtles and piranhas , snakes and aquatic animals before you visit the amazon cruise. You will have chance to touch star fish and horse shoe fish with guided experience. And highest attraction is giant pandas and red panda. You get to see them happily sleeping. This attraction can be covered within 2-3 hrs and you can visit night safari as well on the same day."
River Safari Singapore,4,If never gone before. I would recommend to go as it different from Singapore zoo and night safari. Good news no need to worry about sun too much
River Safari Singapore,4,"A place for families and tourists alike, where you can view water creatures and other wildlife creatures that are amazing to look at, loving its nature like environment, definitely will visit again."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Been visiting the River many many times since its opening and each time has been a pleasant experience. Its a great place to visit during extremely hot weather or a rainy day as the whole park is sheltered. Highly recommend for animal and fish lovers.

On todays visit, I liked the newly added aquatic plants in many of the exhibits as well as new animals in some enclosures.

Some feedback: bring back animal feeding times even if there is no presentation. Animal feedings are one of the most interactive sessions visitors enjoy."
River Safari Singapore,5,A one of its kind of safari. I love all the four parks in Singapore. This park is special for me because of the red panda and the real panda Kai Kai and jia jia
River Safari Singapore,3,Aii... Sad to say that after we came back from River safari.... My kids sick... 😭
River Safari Singapore,5,It teaches me about animals and I can see that they are all healthy and happy
River Safari Singapore,5,Loved the amazon boat ride. Kids need to be at least 1.06m to ride.
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to visit while you make the trip to the zoo.
River Safari Singapore,5,"By far the best of the 3 attractions here. Such up close views of so many of the animals. The monkeys are spectacular (are pick pockets), the manatees are amazing, I loved the capybaras & the red panda was so adorable and loves to pose."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Lots of fish in an underground, walk through fish tank. Tank glass is very thick... like 8 or more inches thick. Also a cool little boat ride, but in the spirit of nickel & dimeing you to death, the boat ride is extra, and not worth the price. Lots of food to buy, but the best one is the ice cream. Bathroom was clean, just like the rest of the park. And I really like how they are trying to save the animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,Pandas are cute but they are sleeping most of the time
River Safari Singapore,5,The Once Upon A River show was great for the kids. A really enjoyable day out - one of the most enjoyable attractions in Singapore for kids
River Safari Singapore,5,When the entrance Hall to all the attractions completed will go again.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Just like the 3 other attractions under the Wildlife Reserves Singapore, River Safari is very well managed and maintained. You can practically spend the whole day here. There are plenty of plenty of choices for food and drinks, spread out in the park. There are also filtered water dispensers strategically placed in the parks. You need only bring your bottles for refills. Parents and children alike would be mesmerized by the animals / exhibits. Most if not all areas are covered, you will be sheltered from the rain & sun. We simply love the park and had an awesome day. We will be back."
River Safari Singapore,5,"The River Safari is as exciting as it's next door neighbor, the zoo. Both places can be visited in a single day with sufficient time to explore both places on foot. The Amazon River Quest is a good experience as well. 2.5  hours is sufficient to be able to cover the whole place comfortably."
River Safari Singapore,5,Good place to go to to spend half a day. The place is not big so it is still acceptable if you spend 3-4 hours in this place.
River Safari Singapore,5,"The best place for all age groups. Rested in nature & maintained so perfectly & very friendly staff to guide you. Different species of aqautic animals you can see & have best time. Also try the Amazon river ride, you need to pay extra 5SGD, but it's worth it 😊🤘"
River Safari Singapore,4,Educational place for all ages.
River Safari Singapore,5,Had a wonderful visit with the family. It was particularly enjoyable because of the animal interaction sessions and the boat ride which the kid enjoyed. Best to go in the morning when the crowds are thinner and when the weather is cooler.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very nicely done Safari. The Indian crocodile is breath taking. They also have Panda 🐼, Jaguar too. Don't miss the 10 minute boat ride it is the best thing about this river Safari."
River Safari Singapore,4,"If you prefer cooler area than zoo, this is the place  Sheltered and lot of fishes, birds and monkeys.."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great variety of animals ..better than visiting the zoo if u have just a few hours to spare...
River Safari Singapore,5,Just Wow.....a must visit place...kids wod enjoy
River Safari Singapore,5,So many animals to see!  Love th organization by the rivers!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Came here after the zoo and was unsure how good a park could be if it was river themed. However I was entirely impressed by the layout and the quality of the exhibits.
The River Safari explores various river habitats and is honestly a must visit park. It houses many aquatic creatures from amphibians, fish to the more unusual animals like manatees. Also it has giant pandas.
The reservoir boat tour is very sedate though, even if the information and history of the reservoir is interesting it's probably on the boring side for some people. It lasts 15 minutes and in my opinion it can be skipped if you want to save time.
The Amazon boat ride is great though but there is a height restriction for safety reasons, so I couldn't take my youngest child.
Overall my whole family really enjoyed our trip to the River Safari!"
River Safari Singapore,5,Don't miss the Amazon river water quest ..Short and fun ! The highlight of our visit was definitely the pandas !
River Safari Singapore,5,So wonderful safari to tell you about animals around world biggest rivers.
River Safari Singapore,5,get more discount from Qten. Great Experience here
River Safari Singapore,5,"Wheelchair friendly. Less crowded on weekdays n weekend afternoons. Took abt 2 hours to walk thru the exhibits assuming no queues. Bring empty bottles for water (free). Food and drinks are a tad more expensive than most places. Would be good to go prepared with snacks (and an empty bag for trash), esp if visiting with children."
River Safari Singapore,4,Worth a one time visit. Amazon River Quest and Amazon Flooded forest are must watch. The show is So So not worth spending waiting time. If you happen to be there do attend but dont wait 2 hrs for that. Plan your time well as River Quest wait times can be 30 min to 45 min or even higher. So can go for River Quest 90 min before show time and should be able to be back without much time lost in waiting.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Family friendly place, also tourist attraction to visit.
Ample parking space available. Fast food available outdoors, and indoor eateries are available.

Main highlight are the 2 pandas - Jia Jia and Kai Kai.

The area is an open space area, with shelter and covered walkway, so even if it rained, u’d be covered.

You can purchase tickets over the counters there, single Parks or multiple Parks. Multiple Parks of course covers the Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Jurong Bird Park & Night Safari. (I guess this is worthy for tourist spending an entire day to night there)"
River Safari Singapore,1,Nothing much. It's still the same. But lesser animals n fishes. Poor maintenance. Don't know what the zoo is doing.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Brought children to see the animals. Easy to maneuver around the place. Mostly sheltheted. The boat ride was thrilling for the kids, though we didn't get to see the animals along the ride."
River Safari Singapore,4,OK not bad and exciting to see here hope to have more River Adventure soon.
River Safari Singapore,4,Ok but not great
River Safari Singapore,4,"Nice experience with so many sea animals and reptiles..specially different kinds of alligators..huge and small with all their teror ...you can watch them and realise what  nature has in Amazon...cruise take you in the reservoir which gives you a pleasent view of night safari as well and if you go at sunset time its beautiful ...
It has big aquariums with huge sea animals like sharks, seals, cat fish etc
Amazon safari takes you to Amazon tour where you can see
Overall worth watching 👀
** 👶 👶 If you are having babies than nursing rooms are also there with all bathrooms 👶 👶**"
River Safari Singapore,4,"There were interesting animals to look at. It would have been a great experiential experience for kids and visitors alike but for the first time only.

It is a tad bit overrated for the size of the park and for repeated trips, it won't be so advisable."
River Safari Singapore,5,"I visit with family's it was
a lots of ppl S'pore local citizens &  from others contry's some of them with familys. They are caples hasband &wife children with happy's face what i one to say come and visit Zoo or Safari or Night Safari you wont regart ok bye bye bye"
River Safari Singapore,5,I enjoyed very much. Big wow! The best out of all Singapore zoos in my opinion.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very nice , the show and boat ride was very good too"
River Safari Singapore,5,"One of tourist and local attraction to visit, highly recommended.
Bring insect repellent along to safe guide especially if you have children."
River Safari Singapore,5,"The aquarium area is nice and interesting, and the otters area is very nice. Remember to go there when they are feeding the otters! These otters are huge. The manetees are very beautiful too."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Lovely place, been here nearly a decade ago... now I’m back! Exciting As ever"
River Safari Singapore,5,Visiting the River Safari is like going to a giant aquarium. The pandas are super derpy and super cute. Took some pictures of the gift shops.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Awesome, truly amazing we went around twice. Incredible how well done and displayed all the creatures are!"
River Safari Singapore,5,I enjoy much of my cruise by the river here....come n enjoy visit the place...
River Safari Singapore,5,Well organised. Just follow the path and you wont miss anything
River Safari Singapore,5,"well worth the money with so much fun.
carpark not an issue.
pls bring stroller for parents with toddler.  there a place for stroller parking at every attraction spot.
better to sign up a season pass as its keep on improving"
River Safari Singapore,5,Great alternative place to be when its rainy. Get a cup of Starbucks and have a nice stroll around the river safari.
River Safari Singapore,5,A great way to spend a day in Singapore. Weekdays are less crowded.
River Safari Singapore,4,this is smaller park compared to the zoo I took around 3hrs to go around.  I wish I could get on the boat for river safari which is being suspended for the covid
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to see a lot of animal variety.
River Safari Singapore,5,I had a fun experience there with my family and I wish together again.👍
River Safari Singapore,5,"Very good. Came here twice. Highlights to me are pandas, manatees and arapaimas. Love the reservoir boat ride - it shows a hidden gem of Singapore."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Always a good time here!! We love that it's fully covered, so it's perfect on a rainy day. My kids LOVE The panda bao at the restaurant too!"
River Safari Singapore,4,Good visit if you can combine with amazon safari too. Various sea creatures along with the habitat locations across gives a good idea.  You can touch a Star fish too.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Good place, but not not as good as Singapore Zoo.
For half day activity, River Safari is good 😍👍🏾"
River Safari Singapore,5,The pandas there are very cute. The food there is also yummy 😋. A lot of people queuing for the pandas today when I went there but have patience.
River Safari Singapore,5,"I love it,  kids love it.  Everybody is happy.  We get to see 🐼"
River Safari Singapore,5,Worth to visit. Air conditioning  and indoor is good for children to visit
River Safari Singapore,5,"The ""underwater"" viewing experience is simply magnificent. One can unwind mindfully while glazing at the surreal moving aquatic animals such as manatees. And of course,  the pandas are soooooo adorable... too bad they are shy and like to hide sometimes."
River Safari Singapore,5,Very good experience and quite scenic but not that much worth a price
River Safari Singapore,5,real Panda...  Amazing spices of fish .. its hugeeee
River Safari Singapore,5,"Lovely place. There are aircon areas all over the park so you won't feel so hot. Parking is pretty exp though, comparing to other parks."
River Safari Singapore,5,"River Safari is a themed Zoo where visitors walk their way through the different zones. The park is divided into two areas, halved by the Upper Seletar Reservoir. The first area called Rivers of the World contains the 7 ""Rivers"" - it features mostly sea animals like fish and crocodiles.  At the end will be a bridge that will take you to the second area, Wild Amazonia - which features mostly rainforest animals."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Only amazon river ride is good, panda were amazing, cruise boat was not so good, nothing much to view in cruise boat."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Air conditioned most of the attraction. Able to get up close view of the pandas. There's other kind of small pandas too, but the two main one are mostly visible. Handicapped friendly, with toilet along the way. Shares the same carpark as the zoo, plenty of spots. There's a Chinese restaurant inside. Another shop selling panda souvenir."
River Safari Singapore,5,Great place to bring family.
River Safari Singapore,3,Good to visit..small kids are not allowed
River Safari Singapore,4,"Small zoo beside the SG zoo. If you want to see panda in SG, it’s the only place. A lot of fish which I don’t recognize. The river cursing is good and Amazon drifting is very cool"
River Safari Singapore,5,"Lots to see and do. For a zoo, the animal/fish enclosures are well designed so that you can get close without unnecessarily disturbing the specimens. Allow a full day."
River Safari Singapore,5,"What an adventure, plus a ‘pleasant’ tropical storm to freshen our moods. The kids loved it and the diversity of animals was very good."
River Safari Singapore,4,Nice place. But the boat ride was canceled due to persistent rains which killed half the fun
River Safari Singapore,4,Boat ride is awesome and interesting 👍👍. River cruise was boring_only giraffe could be seen. The place has some excellent animal and fish collection. Aquarium water was murky and i couldnt enjoy feeding show. One can enjoy it along with singapore zoo. There is food court near entrance. Ticketing procedure was tiresome as we had already paid for it on-line and they still made us stand in the long queue for the printed tickets. Souvenir shop is also good but as usual quite pricey.
River Safari Singapore,5,Wonderful place to visit
River Safari Singapore,5,Very well constructed. The boat ride was fun and you can go on unlimited rides in case you were unable to catch some of the animals the first round.
River Safari Singapore,5,Good place to visit with kids. Loved the gaint Panda exhibit especially the Red Panda was a treat. Squirrel Monkey exhibit was nice too. Amazon river ride was interesting.  All in all good 4 hours spend at River safari.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Cute animals, especially red panda and giant panda. Eye opening journey for those who haven't seen. Food/drinks is tourist level pricing, expect to pay a higher premium."
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice ride for pre-schoolers. But minimum height 1.06m.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Will take around 2 hours to explore. Except the Pandas, there is nothing worth visiting in this place. 4 stars for the cute Panda"
River Safari Singapore,5,A Must visit place in Singapore to have a close look on some magnificent species especially the Pandas. Other attractions include boat rides.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Good experience, very friendly and helpful staff."
River Safari Singapore,5,Spend $32 for entrance but its worth it..we enjoyed the river cruise its so relaxing ..we are lucky we saw a lot of animals during our visit
River Safari Singapore,5,Better than Night Safari. Reservoir Cruise is not fascinating.
River Safari Singapore,5,Love this place. Staff are friendly. Panda is cute. Manatee is my favourite !!
River Safari Singapore,5,River safari is the latest attraction to the Singapore Mandai zoo . I like the sheltered part of the river safari and one can covered the river safari within 2-3 hours . Great for both adults and kids
River Safari Singapore,3,Don't expect too much. It's a short trip with only a few wild animals along the path. The high light is a large group of flamingo only.
River Safari Singapore,5,An awesome place for the whole family and kids. Easily 1-2hrs looking at all the exhibits and going for the rides etc. There's a place to rest and grab a bite near the panda exhibits.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Excellent... All in one attraction... Must see.!!!

River Safari at Singapore Zoo is very good and it offers the following all in just one place...

1. Zoo, a close look to certain animals
2. Giant Panda forest with pandas and red pandas.
3. Aquarium with big viewing pools and a under water tunnel. (Tunnel was under maintanence during my visit though)
Thanks
4. Boat ride through the Singapore river to see some animals.
5. An adventure ride at Amazon River Quest

Worth spending money. Realised Best value due the money spent.

Plan for at least 4 hours."
River Safari Singapore,5,Let the pictures speak for themselves. ❤ Worth it. Will definitely go back.
River Safari Singapore,3,It’s ok to visit once. Personally prefer Singapore Zoo.
River Safari Singapore,4,The River Safari encompasses a fairly large area but well contained and one can further explore and spend a lot of time here. One should factor in the heat and humidity. There is a nice relaxing boat ride of the reservoir too. Nice diversity of birds and animals.
River Safari Singapore,4,Saw Panda!! And my Otter friend. Clean and easy to walk around. Some places have air con
River Safari Singapore,5,Manatees are special. They show how they feed Manatees. Get in the boat ride as well
River Safari Singapore,5,"I like this part of the Zoological Garden simply for one reason - it is weather proof. With the cover around the park, one can visit this park regardless rain or shine.

Personally, the display on the various aquatic animals (especially fishes) is more varied and more interesting than what they have in SEA World.

Of course, the Panda is the main draw of this part"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Depending on your sequence of visit, some animals might kinda be repeated here. The must-see animals is definitely the 2 pandas, which sometimes may be hiding in their den. Catch an Amazon Boat Quest for maximum experience and dine at Panda Cafe!"
River Safari Singapore,5,The best places to visit to see the wonders and nature of the river mammals.
River Safari Singapore,5,"What an experience..
If you want to see a Panda.. then you must visit the river safari at the Singapore zoo"
River Safari Singapore,5,"First time in river safari, and it was awesome! Such interesting facts about animals and so many different species to see! Really cool concept!"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Located at Mandai. Singapore zoo, Night safari and River safari are adjacent places. good for families and teens. Can reach here by shuttle from Khatib Mrt or Smrt Bus from Ang Mo kio Mrt. Good place , Wifi Free."
River Safari Singapore,3,good place for kids. unfortunate that we cant enjoy da full park due additional charge on da amazon quest. need more eateries. a starbucks quickies inside will be big attraction. cruise was boring.
River Safari Singapore,1,"Extremely disappointing experience.

Park was so small that you can finish everything in less than 2 hours.

River cruise is closed and children below 1.05 cannot take the river quest. Both were not mention when you buy the tickets. That’s a huge part of the park that we cannot experience.

Only 3 shows and 50 max capacity. We are not even allow to watch from afar with social distancing.

Would not go again."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Must visit the squirrel monkey forest, and also spend time watching the manatee ,it’s so therapeutic ☺️"
River Safari Singapore,5,Great attraction!  If you had the choice between this and the zoo - pick this one!
River Safari Singapore,4,"Rather small wildlife park. You would need at most 3hrs to complete the park.

Highlights of the park are:
- Pandas
- Amazon River Quest (Additional charges)
- River Cruise"
River Safari Singapore,5,"We loved the river safari!  River Safari has a huge range of exhibits. Make sure you plan enough time to see all of the tanks and the exhibits. Say hello to their red pandas and giant pandas, and enjoy the two boat rides!"
River Safari Singapore,4,Loved the panda enclosure and Amazon exhibits!
River Safari Singapore,5,"Well worth a visit. Surrounded by the tranquil lower seletar reservoir. Hear the waves crashing onto the shore. Many different types of rivers, nile river, mary river, yangtze river, yellow river, ganges river and much more were displayed. The even had a touch pool that allowed us to touch the starfish and stingray. The texture were wildly different from what I thought. Cute panda feeding on bamboo. They are imported from chengdu. Explanations are clear, lively and precise. There is a ride on the reservoir for free with the audio speaking about the wildlife parks in a lively tone. Towering trees surround it like a countryside. We were awestruck by the myriad of performances by the animals."
River Safari Singapore,5,Really fun place to spend some time in Singapore. The place was larger than I expected.
River Safari Singapore,5,"Nice to see panda, the panda pau is nice."
River Safari Singapore,5,A great place for family outing! All walking pavements are sheltered!! 👍🏻👍🏻
River Safari Singapore,3,It is a ok place compared to the zoo and Jurong bird park. Do take the river safari ride.
River Safari Singapore,4,The River Safari makes you feel you are in the middle of Amazon Forest with a lot of focus into fish and aquarium and you can see the Panda there
River Safari Singapore,5,Enjoyable trip in River Safari
River Safari Singapore,5,A handful of rare unique animals. Amazing!
River Safari Singapore,4,"River Safari is a place that focuses mainly on the animals that can be found from the Rivers of the world(Mekong , Ganges, River Nile, Mississipi, Yangtze, Amazon and Mary River). The good thing about this place is that it is fully sheltered so if you need a wet weather plan, you can always go to River Safari as Mandai Zoo is not fully sheltered. You will mainly see a variety of marine animals in River Safari such as fishes, stingrays, manatee, otters, crocodiles and snapping turtles. The main draw to this attraction has to be Kai Kai and Jia Jia, the adorable panda bears that can be found in the Yangtze River area. Another enclosure that I really liked is the Squirrel Monkey forest because you can really get up close with the squirrel monkeys. Remember to keep your food and plastic bags in your bag before you enter the Squirrel Monkey Forest as the monkeys may snatch them. There is a touch pool in the Mary river area. Kids will enjoy this as they will get to touch the starfish, sea cucumbers and some tiny fishes.

Recently, they added an animal show called Once Upon a River which is shown at 11.30am and 3.30pm daily. There are not a lot of seats so do arrive earlier to get a better view of the stage.

River Safari is significantly much smaller than Mandai Zoo. If you have to choose to visit just one place, I would strongly recommend Mandai Zoo over River Safari."
River Safari Singapore,5,Giant Pandas display house is very comfortable.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Enjoyable boat ride, entertaining animal show by staff"
River Safari Singapore,5,Loved the Squirrel Monkeys the most.
River Safari Singapore,5,Wonderful place to visit. Just amazing.
River Safari Singapore,5,Perfect place as expected in Singapore!! 5/5
River Safari Singapore,5,I had good time with my family last weekend. It was raining but good to walk around.
River Safari Singapore,4,"Nice ride, but not much animals"
River Safari Singapore,5,My kids enjoyed the outing last weekend. Totally recommend.
River Safari Singapore,1,"Lack of crowd-control. Long queues and waiting time. No comfortable waiting area. Ended up squeezing like tunas and sweating. Worst, it's EXTREMELY hard to get cabs to go back home so good luck to whoever coming here.The whole place is inconvinient and inaccessible. Lack of aircons and for smokers , my deepest condolences because the smoking corner is really far . Pls just put a smoking corner/designated place in a convenient place rather than make us walk far? You have so much space in the park, there has to be at least somewhere you could fit this small comfort."
River Safari Singapore,5,"Every kids must be excited to visit, don't forget take cruise and boat safari 😋👍✌"
River Safari Singapore,4,"Fun learning for young kids to get close to nature, animals and fishes around our rivers across the world. Amazon River Quest is a must do ride."
River Safari Singapore,4,"Except for the show which filled 30 mins before the recommended 30 mins earlier queue. Besides that, Kai Kai will come out at about 2 ish, so just chill there ~~ overall enjoy the walk 😊"
River Safari Singapore,4,Very clean and well maintained
River Safari Singapore,5,Meticulously designed marine life zoo. We easily sent 4 hours and actually did not manage to cover the all place. Lots of fun for the kids and the entire trail is roofed so no need to worry about any rain.
River Safari Singapore,5,Sheltered aircorn
River Safari Singapore,5,Nice place for families. And they have nice aquariums and many fish collection
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Purchased the unlimited ride ticket. Very worth it and value for money. The view from the cable car is very good and you may not have chance to get such view in other places in Singapore. You can even arrange to have dinner in the cable car. The sunset view is very nice and the unlimited rides ticket allow you to make multiple trips to capture the best sunset views.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"A round trip sky pass (for both Sentosa and mount Faber lines) surprised our family as we took a trip on a boring afternoon. The children loved the view, kites (large birds) swooping around our cabin from time to time and amazing views of the dolphins tanks below in the dolphin cove attractions. The travel speed was Goldilocks slow, just slow enough to sit and enjoy the views. About 1.5 hours round trip. A welcomed change from all the fast paced sight seeing and activities around us!"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Initially, one will be scary to step inside the cable car seeing the height and the route. However, the journey is very comfortable and the view from this long cable car journey from Mount Faber to Sentosa is awesome.
It is definitely a wonderful experience to see the beautiful skyline of Singapore with the splendid view.
We could not enjoy the  food at the restaurant at Mount Faber as the available menu was not of our liking."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great experience with my husband birthday month 50% voucher to redeem and go with family members best ever. Still got a lot of person getting around here. We have fun a lot. 😍
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Cable car is fun ride and get to see spectacular panoramic view of Singapore from sky, lush greenery of mount Faber and aerial view of Sentosa and sea view. Ideal time to take the ride is 4pm and need 2 hours to complete both Mount Faber line and Sentosa line. You will get to see the picturesque views by sunset. Ticket price at counter is higher better purchase online."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Pricey but good touristy experience to view South Singapore from the sky. Good to keep the kids entertained. Every stop is accessible via walking or stroller/wheelchair. Best time to visit is 6+, to view the sunset and or have a different atmosphere going to and from Sentosa."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"We took the ride from Mount Faber and loved it totally.

The view from cable car is breath taking.

It is  normal to take cable car to Sentosa when we are showing the guests around.

I have had pleasant experiences taking the cable car.

You don't get to see the similar view from anywhere else when you see bright skies above and beautiful water body below you.

Enjoy the ride and scenery of sea and ships from the top.

Could not upload  my video for you ,it gives me option to share photograph only."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice view. Loved every minute of it. Would definitely come again.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Offers spectacular views of the Harbourfront area and Sentosa. Large and spacious cabins that could do with some upgrading (charging points, audio narration or music). Ideal for families using the Rediscover vouchers."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"To travel to sentosa from the city, you can take the cable car ride from harbourfront station. an enjoyable ride though. The cable car also has dine-in option which is the best thing, I have ever tried. Eating your food at a greater altitude that too about the sea. Yearly passes also available which is really worth it. There are 4 stations where you can break and continue your journey. We usually take the cable car to travel from vivacity to silosa beach, almost every week before Covid."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Nice experience, the cable car must better then 45years ago..."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"Now it have two different lines that travel on Sentosa, one of the line is on the island itself, and the other one travel from Mount Faber to Sentosa."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,It has been a very long time since but these new cars are very sturdy. It was such a comfortable ride I was just snapping pictures away.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Well organized boarding. Nice views of the Sentosa area
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Always such an adventure to get into the cable cars. My kids truly enjoy the sights . So much fun. The cars are always clean , we have a membership so use it regularly. Looks well maintained so feels very safe (I’m a chicken of heights so this is a plus point to know the cars are always tip top)"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Hassle free booking and redemption using Klook. We entered through Harbourfront Tower and there was not much crowd. However, there should be more clearer communications on ground showing that if you have the voucher with QR Code, you don't have to queue.

But overall, fun experience! Had a pretty good time after not being on the cable car for years. Took the ride around 6pm and managed to witness the beautiful sky too. Recommended! :)

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice place to hang out
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Accessible via car. Aside from the cable car base station, there is a alfresco dining restaurant, a sunset bar and a walking trail nearby"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Breathtaking view, even at night"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"Cable car too hot, not enough ventilation. I took it in the afternoon"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Good way to see the views here!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,I afraid of height but after testing on it. It OK and safe. Car are clean and nice. Can try if you are not afraid height.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"An amazing way to enter Sentosa island !!!! The prices are decent and the views from the cable car are just amazing... There are long queues during rush hours but the queue  move pretty quickly so that is not a problem. The cable cars itself are in amazing condition and are very safe. All in all, you will get a breathtaking experience with amazing views."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,I felt too scare! 😂😂😂
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"amazing experience!! There isn't a view like this. You can see the entire Singapore from the top. The breathtaking greenery, the sea, universal. I bet the thrill that you get cannot be matched agaisnt another! I enjoyed watching a nice sunset from the cable car. Loved the experience. Looks like a dream sequence."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Could only review for the wash room.
Probably the best wash room view in Singapore.
It is clean and photo worthy"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Amazing view!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Polite and patient staff
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Thanks Singapore for the tourism voucher! The cable car exeprience is relaxing. Good for family to go together.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great views from cable cars across Sentosa and Siloso Beach. Bars and eateries along the beach with activities including bungee jumping and flying fox.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Get round about ticket for more value, nice beautiful view of sentosa and harbourfront"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"It was fun being so high up and gazing below....the view from the top, picturesque🤩😍🤩😍🤩"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Its great to bring kids...nice view
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Buy the 1 year pass! And enjoy unlimited rides from harbor front to imbiah and across sentosa. Spectaculor views above sea and forest, a way to escape from the busy lifes on the grounds."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,You have to ride this to understand the layout of the island
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Awesome cable car rides. One and only cable car in Singapore...
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"Overall a gd experience. Journey is not long.. full mt faber line takes abt 15mins & full sentosa line takes abt 10mins. However it is on the pricey side. Ticketing counter at mt faber peak is SLOW (minus 1 star), with snaking Q, so be prepared."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Enjoyed the rides Scenery is especially worthwhile on the Mount Faber line. Be prepared that at mount Faber itself, a number of attractions are closed (condoned off ) Sentosa line made it easier to access entertainment venues from one end of the island to the other ... Good overview of the island"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"It's a good idea to take the cable car from Harbour front to the peak, then walk to telok blangah. It will safe a lot of time."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Pride of SG. Well sure is hot compared to taking it in Genting Highlands but well, you will be treated to a great scenery of our little island!"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Picturesque views, very silent and stable, airy comfortable cabin. Highly recommended."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Good and nice place to go if you never been a cable car before. Walk all the way up to the mountain might be very hot, but I have to say it is very beautiful along the way up. The cable car itself is ok, you get to see the whole sentosa island."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,"The cable itself is great but there were a lot of communications flaws that make you feel they don't genuinly care about their customers:

1. First they charge 10$ more expensive for counter tickets than online which was quite shocking and a bit of a waste of time.
2. The person at the counter told us that the 2 way trip included the whole cable cars but in fsct it only included 1 lf the 2 cable car and then they charge you extra if you want to do the one on sentosa. Felt a lot like a money squeeze and back packaging.

Overall good to do once but those issues didn't make us feel we would like to go back."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"The cable car is a must-ride to get a beautiful aerial view of Singapore between Harbor Front, Mount Faber, and Sentosa. Get two different perspectives by riding one way in the day and another at night. If you like a little thrill, take the one with a glass bottom which allows you to see the landscape go by under your feet.

That's also  a fun way to visit Sentosa besides taking the monorail or driving to the resort island. Furthermore, the Cable Car Musuem is at the drop off point on Sentosa where you get to learn of the history and evolution of the cable car system."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,We book from Klook and find it quit cheap. We been through all 6 station and the view was fantastic.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Great. And the annual pass is very reasonably priced. My son loves it. But please take the automatic song and video off in the cable car!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,"Change scam !
Be careful. Tried to give back 20 bath note.
Harbourfront station"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Scenic view of Sentosa ♥
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"We boarded the cable car from Siloso Point. I booked the ticket on the spot on Klook to get a better price. The cable car gives a breathtaking, bird-eye view of the entire Sentosa and scenic view of beach coastline. Wonderful experience!"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"We Don't Ride The Cable Car But We Enjoy The Customer Service With The Information Of The Cable Car.
Service Execellence And Thumbs Up👍🏻"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Superb way to cross to the santosa island with a million dollar 💵 view. Station itself a nice place the hangout with restaurants to feed your taste buds
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,One of bst. things to do...this 45mins cable car gives u view of entire Singapore nd santosa island..
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Just love it. Beautiful views of Singapore downtown on one side and Sentisa island and the sea on the other side
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Missing proper cafe at the difference stations or anything to do really. Other than just take the cable car and run in cycles, nothing else"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"This is the beginning of the Mount Faber Sky Cable car of Singapore. I recommend that you come to take the cable car from the peak of the mount faber and follow the cable line thought Habourfront and continue to Sentosa. Then change the line by 2mn walk to continue to either Merlion or Siloso beach. Each part of the ride give different views: mountain, sea, port, city, sentosa island, universal studio, merlion, beach, ....."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Since we all are stuck on this red dot. Take this means of transportation  to get a going  overseas feeling. At least you are out of the effing island.
Most of us are at breaking point to go out of this country for a real break.
Ok ok back to the Singapore cable car.
Enjoyed the ride as always. Almost memorized the in cabin narration as been taking it too often divert my attention that
We can't really get out of this country yet. Overall, I bought the licence so I don't have to worry much about the cost. Travel as much you want for 1 year. I guess by the time it expires, we should be able to use our ""powerful"" passport again.🥴. Else there might be massive mental Illness."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Beautiful views of the harbour and island, cosy cable car that is stable and not scary."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice rides
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice place for Tourist photo taking
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very nice to ride cable car
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,quite beautiful and well maintained. $3 within sentosa. $21 round trip mount faber with dbs card. maybe not worth the full $35/$39.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,For a nice view of the Southern parts of Singapore
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Love the cable car ride! It takes roughly 25 minutes from mount Fabre to sentosa.

Enjoy the scenic view and have a great day with your love one who is going"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,The cable car ride was excellent! A must do in Singapore. Not too expensive and the views are breathtaking.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"I enjoyed the cable car ride, but the price of the ride was totally unfair. For one time ride it was S$35, but for a yearly membership it was just S$39."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice ride. We liked the view and my 3yo had lots of fun!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Its wonderful experience and very romantic if you go with your partner
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,prices are high. but kids enjoy a lot.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Obligatory must do in todo list. Island of diversity of completely entertainment and for calm and relax and sport extreme and fun! For adults and children! It’s not just universal Studios and water park. You could not going there. It’s very big area for exploring to walk, for pic and even you can find real island nature. Take a ticket for round trip with 2 cable car way exactly!you would be happy! It’s deserving to spend even 1 all day for this! Envoy! Hope it’ll be useful for someone)"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"The technology marvel I would say, the quality of cable car services were really good."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,"Nice views but crazy prices for something which is merely a ride to Sentosa. Save your money, take the bus and enjoy more stuff inside Sentosa."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Its best to take the ride from Mount Faber, beautiful view and worth the experiences."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Loved the experience so much that i upgraded one day ticket to annual membership
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great view riding the cable car!:)
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Organised n hygienic in view of COVID19. Staff were helpful n attentive.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,courteous and friendly staff. helps out and holds out their hands to people they think needs to when boarding and leaving the gondolas. DON'T forget to have your hand stamped at the very first station you get to ride your first. They are supposed to do that.I suggest getting the day pass and the extras especially for the Merlion tour/photo taking
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,We're regulars and have the yearly pass cause our toddler loves it!!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Fantastic views at great comfort, friendly and professional staff."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Check out the toilet. It's free and it's got a million dollar view overlooking Sentosa.

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Went during weekday super chill
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"A great way to see the Singapore harbor, Sentosa and Mount Faber."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"This is one of the best tourist spot in Singapore. As usual this place is neatly maintained. The taxis pick up from any location drop us in front of entrance.
The cable car takes us to five different locations including to the place Singapore Icon.There are places of beauty and a panoramic view can be seen from cable car.
There are beach and places for stroll and restaurants especially south Indian eatable. we can spend up to three hours enjoying scenic beauty."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice experience stunning view
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,It was a good experience overall.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Fantastic views of marina bay and Sentosa

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice experience
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Cable car is nice to ride to mount Faber to sintosa on the top you can see the views of long way road and  view of the sea  at sentosa.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Gulbuddin
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great view of Singapore
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Love the view
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,I would to have endless rides as the view is just breathtaking. Good thing everyone gets to ride to in order to make it to the studio. Everyone should ride this as words just dont do the justice to it's beauty.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,"We checked the waiting queue before purchasing tickets and it seemed reasonable. After getting in the queue we found that it had a huge part after the building corner. The heat in the line after corner is exhausting.

If we knew about the more than an hour wait we wouldn’t have purchased tickets."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Very nice experience. A must visit for tourists. One of the ways to enter Sentosa island. Make sure you cover all the stations and morning and evening times. Do visit Faber peak as cable car is the fastest and easiest way to go there. It runs till 9:30 in night so plan accordingly.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Used the cable car to get from mainland to mount Faber park and to get around the island. The cable cars are clean and it is mapped out very clearly so easy to navigate around using the cable cars. The views are stunning, particularly at sunset time."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Awesome view in the evening
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Actually a very fun ride that does a round trip of about 40-60 minutes. The segment from Mt Faber to Sentosa goes quite high. Exhilarating and yet a bit nerve racking if you have a fear of heights. My British visitors love it because we were able to have a short stop at  beautiful Siloso Beach and take some sunset pictures with coconut trees as the backdrop. Tropical and gorgeous.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very nice place
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Beautiful night view
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Very convenient and entertaining for kids. Had some trouble with one of the staff members there, complaint was launched and addressed very aptly by the management."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,It's a really good time experienced.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Very easy way to hop over to Sentosa Island. Beautiful views over the city. Very modern cars that make you feel safe at any time. The only downside is the pricing. Taxi would be cheaper, but, by far not as nice."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,what an experience it was
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Exciting place gives you a good view of South Singapore. I loved travelling Cable car.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Our favorite family outing!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Great experience to have, it goes via mount Faber then over harbour front and then multiple stations in Sentosa."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,Tourist overrated and an hour waiting line. Take a Grab instead. Save time and money!!!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Nice views but too pricey. Can save your money, take the bus and enjoy more stuff inside Sentosa"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Safe and clean
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! If you want to go to Sentosa, this is the way to do it. The ticket is very affordable (19$ per person) and the views are truly worth it. Singapore looks gorgeous from above, (as if anyone didn't already know that), but you also get to fly above the beautiful sea and the picturesque Sentosa which looks magical.
A pro-tip would be to space out your trip so you would get to experience the views both in their day version and night version, which are both uniquely beautiful and worth it."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Great views from the cable car. There are multiple routes, make sure you take the right route"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,For sightseeing from above. Also near Faber peak a beautiful forest walk.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Always a great experience, nice breeze. Their annual membership is a must, every cent worth. One of the peaceful tours for me to just sit and keep going."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Booked tickets via klook. Fun way to get into Sentosa Island.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Very convenient and comfortable ride, flawless maintenance, helpful and courteous staff"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,I amazed to see this cable car. We get a fantastic view of the Singapore at the cable car.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,Good
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great views. Ticket includes back and fourth. Which is good. Walk i would opt out as its not great and has lots of mosquitos.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Everyone must travel in cable car 😃 best experience.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"My wife and I went to Sentosa and enjoyed our time there and we wanted to return on the Cable Car and were surprised that price was for two way only. We think people should be able to pay a cheaper price for a one way trip.
The view was okay but we got a better view of Singapore from the Observation Deck on top of Marina Bay Sands.
Visited April 2015"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Nice view from top
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Would definitely recommend when in Singapore, you get to see all of it from the top.
Breathtaking views and a lovely experience."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,I liked this one. was a good experience
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very romantic cable car
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,It's a wonderful ride life time experience
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Must not miss this experience if your visiting Singapore. The cable car rides provided a great view of the Singapore and the Sentosa Island. I recommend ordering your tickets online in order to save money and skip the queue.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Nice scenic view all the way along, and our trip is from HarbourFront Station > Mount Faber Station > HarbourFront Station > Universal > HarbourFront Station.

This location has a souvenir shop and a cafe. But if you are ending the cable car ride from here, need to consider the transportation because no bus or taxi."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Wonderful ride. beautiful scenery
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Good views @ sunset.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Good experience.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"I've used Klook for the return trip, and it was affordable + worth it!
Mount Faber Park is a nice walk and can visit the Henderson Waves at the same time. Fantastic one-day-trip including Sentosa and hills with views"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,First time I ever rode a cable car. Unforgettable! ♥
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Beautiful and serene views throughout .... Sunset view is recommended ...
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great view of the shore. Bought tickets online easily and what an incredible ride!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,A exciting ride on the cable car to sentosa island. Starting from Mount Faber to the island . Do take the ride when visiting sentosa for the experience. The ticket includes the cable car on the island from Merlion to Silosa. I have posted a hyperlapse video of the ride to give you a feel of the thrill.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Mesmerizing
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,This is a very scenic ride and is a must do if you have kids. You can get really good pics and it's a convenient way to travel in Sentosa.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Beautiful views and decent ride duration.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Great view! Tourist destination in Singapore.
A better alternative and a bit expensive transport to Sentosa but gives a good view while travelling! 👍"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Well known good n fantastic experience
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Best view to see sentosa island in singapore. There is cafe with great view as well
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great experience and not too expensive. Awesome views of the harbor. The best way to get up or down Mount Faber
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,"view is okay, better to go to mt farbor directly and enjoy park. After hiking in Norway & other countries you learn there are much better views"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Good maintenance.. welled trainers
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great! Just don't love heights
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Gives you the Arial view of Resorts world santosa..
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Ride the cable car if you visit Singapore. Enjoy the scenic Singapore harbour view overseeing the fun resort island of Sentosa. Start from the Mount Faber station. If you are inland at Sentosa, you can try the inland line which lets you enjoy the Sentosa beach view and the open sea beyond."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Used the cable car to visit Santosa. Unlimited cable car use and 2 attractions on the island for $50. The cabins modern and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Excellent experience
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"One of the 3 ways to enter into Sentosa and I must say the most glorious way to enter into Sentosa. Cable Car gives you a birds eye view of a very prominent and happening area of Singapore, amazing connectivity. A must while visiting Singapore."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,If you're heading to Sentosa or Mt Faber you may as well travel by the cable car & get nice views. It's reasonably priced & comfortable.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,A wonderful place for family hang out
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Absolutely beautiful! Must try
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"nice experience seeing mount faber and sentosa island from above. it is also useful as an alternative for travel from the main island to sentosa island. get your ticket from travel agent online, it is cheaper, around $20 for the whole roundtrip package."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Love it so much, we bought the 1 year pass for two adults and two kids. Perfect way to travel to sentosa and avoid the crowd in the trams!"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Great view of parts of harbor.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,"Views are ok. Expensive for what it is.
Got this from Sentosa to Mount Faber, which is essentially a pub and souvenir shop. There are no taxis at Mount Faber so we had to get the cable car back to Harbourcity to find a cab."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"Another great attraction!
Best way to see all of the city and coast in Singapore 😉Great also for families and if you want transport to Sentosa attractions"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,View of Sentosa is fantastic. Ride is scenic and a must do in Singapore.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,It was fantastic ride
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Stable cable. Great views Singapore's theme parks, beaches, hills, and the port."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"We bought annual islander pass, which costs 1-2 one time passes to the cable car. So now we can enter the island all year round for free using any type of transport including cable car, which is btw quite convenient."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"The rides were great, just that the ticket purchase line at mount faber was slow. Also, it would be good if there were signs at the ticket counter Q to tell those who purchased vouchers on Safra website that they still have to join the ticket queue to redeem the tickets.

Of course, it would be even better if we could skip the Q and redemption process as it is time consuming i.e. recognize the safra vouchers directly."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,Very hot n stuffy.. Boring scenery . Uncomfortablefoe the price.  The one to mount Faber is worst.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,U can get an awesome view of santosa island
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,There were two of the first cable cars which have been used for transportation. Nice for memorial photos.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,Lovely views but not much to see on Sentosa
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Fun ride to get to the island.  Families welcome and the staff will try to place you in your own car.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very nice ride.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,An unmissable attraction when visiting Singapore. The views are incredible!!
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Wonderful experience overseing Singapore city and sentosa island
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"The best way to enter the magical island of Santosa. Although a tad bit more expensive than the other alternatives available to enter Santosa island, the cable car is the most flamboyant one by far, allowing you to gaze upon the beauty of the mystic island through a birds eye view. Definitely a must for anyone visiting Singapore and Santosa island."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,Very sad what happened with  beautiful  Sentosa
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Take the tickets in advance. It's easy and cheep.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very good view and beautiful scenery
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Really fun with family: amazing view.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"we had so much fun riding this cable car, make sure you buy both the routes.. Peak and Sentosa"

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Two lines covers Harbour front and Sentosa .

Awesome beach and land views"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Great view of Singapore and sentosa island. Ride lasts less than expected.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Cable car is my most favorite tour i made so exciting.From Vivo city it takes a long walk going to mt faber. ITS located on the 15th floor..Try it and its enjoyable...
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,Expensive
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Amazing scenic beauty. Take s full ride till island from mount faber peak

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Very Scenic View of the city from the cable car.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,3,"I had bought 2 tickets online. Went to the ticket counter at Harbourfront, was told to go to Vivo side to collect tickets. Why can't one collect from HBF side? Went to Vivo had to join long snaking queue! The reason why people buy online is so to avoid queuing. There should be a counter for people who had booked and paid online. So much unnecessary hassle."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"Best way to see the scenic views of singapore  , and best way to go from singapore to sentosa island"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"We enjoyed a lot over there, excellent view."
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,The experience of life
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,"It was very unclear that we had to collect paper tickets from our online purchase since we got a QR code, and when it was our turn to board the ticket lady said we had to go down and collect them in the booth. My boyfriend went down but I wasn't allowed to keep our spot in line. So we had to stand in line all over again and the staff were REALLY unprofessional about it. When customers spend 33$ on a single ride - LEARN SOME SERVICE PLEASE??"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,2,"Expensive and short. A disappointment... If u can afford, go for it. If not than just walk or take a monorail into sentosa. Much cheaper"
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Good experience while going to Sentosa resort
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,1,We paid for tickets in advance and took a taxi there only to be told there is an hour plus wait. Needless to say we were very disappointed. Suggest they publish wait time online so tourists like us can plan around.
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Cool it is good I had to ride it 3 times😊😊😊
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,Must visit. Buy tickets online for better deal
Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,Pretty smooth and amazing experience.. worth ride for once..

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"(Translated by Google) Mount Faber~Sentosa
It used to be a long queue to take a cable car, and it took an hour to wait. Now due to the epidemic situation, even if it is a holiday, there are not many people, the service staff still retain their enthusiasm, and they all spray and disinfect the tourists after they leave the station.

When boarding, the scenery is unobstructed, a great experience

花柏山~圣淘沙
以前搭cable car 是大排长龙，而且要等上1个钟头。现在因为疫情的关系，即使是假日，都没什么人，服务人员仍保有热忱，并且都有在游客下站后，做喷洒消毒的动作。

搭乘时，风景一览无遗，很棒的体验"

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"(Translated by Google) I used it with my family when I went to Sentosa Island,
There is a gondola platform on Mount Faber, the view to Sentosa Island on the gondola is the best, and there are various ways to get to Sentosa Island, but it is the most recommended.
The price is a little high, but if you search online, there are many sites where you can buy tickets at a discounted rate, and there are also sites that support Japanese.

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"(Translated by Google) Singapore is very beautiful but warm and humid most of the year and very expensive, we were on a cable car, the tickets are very expensive, but the shaker can be easily given up and taken to Santosa Island with a free train that leaves every few minutes. Santosa Island has an amazing royal beach with year-round hot water, highly recommended

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,4,"(Translated by Google) Very nice little walk to go to the island of Sentosa. To do in the middle of the day or in the evening. You can even have lunch in a certain cabin with the dinning option. It costs $ 288 per couple.

Cable Car Singapore & Mount Faber,5,"(Translated by Google) Structure inaugurated in 1974 but looks brand new. If you want to spend a day in Sentosa and want to turn it long and wide I recommend the day pass (they give you the blue bracelet) and you can go up and down unlimitedly, visit the beaches, wander around the resort and watch the evening shows of wings of time, unmissable. Perfect for taking photos of the city from another angle and seeing the beauties of Sentosa. Highly recommended !!!

(Original)
Struttura inaugurata nel 1974 ma sembra nuova di zecca. Se volete passare una giornata a Sentosa e volete girarla in lungo e largo consiglio il pass giornaliero (vi danno il braccialetto blu) e potete scendere e salire illimitatamente, visitare le spiaggie, girare x il resort e vedere gli spettacoli serali del wings of time, imperdibile.
