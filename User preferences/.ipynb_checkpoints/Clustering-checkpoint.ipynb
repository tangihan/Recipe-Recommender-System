      "Some tips: Keep a watchful eye on your tea after to add the milk - I heated to just a very beginning of a boil, then dropped the heat to the lowest setting - all the while keeping the cover off.  Once the 2 minutes were past, and you remove the tea from heat, I re-covered the tea and let it steep only 4 minutes.  Also - for easy straining, place a papper coffee filter into a mesh strainer basket set over a bowl or jug.  The coffee filter and the mesh strainer catch every last tea leaf.\n",

The directions are a little vague - I was unclear what cut of meat to use and finally decided upon sirloin steaks cut about 1/2\" thick.  I didn't care for the pan frying method - I would recommend grilling the meat rather than the panfrying.  I thought the amount of oil was way too much - I didn't need to add the extra 2 Tbsp. of oil when cooking the onions.  I might make this again, but only with lots of alterations.\n",

The  bleu cheese completely disappeared into the dough - both my husband and child (card carrying bleu cheese haters) LOVED this bread. They didn't even realize there was any cheese in the bread.  It has just a hint of port wine flavor - and it has a lovely light brown color.  It rose up beautifully in my machine.  A real treat - better than the average bread machine recipe.  We used very good quality port wine. I used the Sweet Bread setting on my machine, which takes 2 hours 50 minutes (my bread machine recommends using SWEET setting for any cheese breads).  I did have to add a few Tablespoons of extra flour as the dough was mixing (during the first 5 minutes) as the dough was a little too wet, which happens often in many bread machine recipes I try.\n",

It's supposed to be a light dessert for after a heavy meal, but no one tells you that it's so good that no matter how much you've stuffed yourself you're going to try to eat your weight in Orange Mousse afterwards.  My guests, who groaned at the prospect of more food, turned into animals and inhaled every spoonful.  I made it non-dairy by subbing soy milk for the cow juice, and it was great!  Thanks Bergy, for the recipe and the compliments that came my way!!!\n",

Had the quiche been crustier I'm sure that this would have been delicious, based on all the other yummy ingredients in the recipe.\n",

I had been searching for years for this recipe after tasting it at an international festival and was pleasantly surpised to find it here.  I would serve this as a dessert to company - it is sweet, caramelly, and a different twist on the idea of fruit & cheese as a dessert course.  It cooks in just minutes and worked well with \"just ripened\" bananas because they held their shape well.  Make sure to cut your cheese very thinly - so that it melts and gets all gooey quickly from the heat of the bananas.  After consulting with the recipe poster, I learned that the authentic cheese used is queijo de mantiega (butter cheese) if you can find that in your area.  I used the mozzarella and thought it was definitely an acceptable choice.  I will be making this one again!\n",

I was a little wary of the salt content (1 serving has 395% of the USRDA!) so I cut back on the salt, added some garlic and ground ginger instead.  We're also not beer drinkers, I can't take the smell of it myself, so I used half a can of Coke instead.  The chicken was delicious, the kids were fighting over the skin, and this recipe makes you wish a chicken had more than 2 legs as well.  The skin came out crispy, the meat was moist, and there was nothing left for the poor dog!\n",

Sarah's Lemon Cake showed up in the list of new recipes on Friday afternoon.  This cake was meant to be!  It was delightfully lemony, and does not make a huge amount, so every crumb was devoured by our 6 member family.  I don't have a scale to measure the ingredients, but do have a very handy measuring cup that has the various weight measurements printed on the side, for flour, sugar, salt, etc.  Thanks, Jan!  BTW, I'm renaming this cake after my daughter Sara, hope you don't mind me losing the H ;-)\n",

We loved it, and it made enough to reheat for breakfast the next morning.  It was easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow.  It's a keeper!\n",

My kiwis were smallish, so I added a few more - the tartness of the kiwis is a nice complement to the sweetness of the pudding.  I omitted the green food coloring, leaving the Cool Whip white. The alternating layers of color - green pudding and white Cool Whip looked very nice - especially with the sprinkling of green sugar atop the final dollop of Cool Whip.  I think I might try using real whipped cream next time, but my family really enjoyed it with the Cool Whip.  These were very good - and your kids will love them.\n",

I tasted a spear to test them when they first came out of the oven (before adding the remaining ingredients) and though they were rather tasty, but liked them less once I added the cheese and the balsamic vinegar.  While the cooking method for this recipe is just about perfect, the flavor combination of cheese and vinegar with the asparagus may not appeal to all taste buds (even if you use quality cheese & vinegar, as I did).  I plan to leave out both the cheese and the vinegar next time and may also stick a clove of garlic in with the spears as they roast for added flavor.\n",

Unfortunately, it only works when the eggs are still hot, but put up to a dozen in a PLASTIC pasta strainer and (holding them above the kitchen sink) bounce them gently in the strainer.  The eggs will bounce up and down and bump into each other, cracking the shells.  Within just a couple minutes the shells will be falling off the eggs in very large, almost whole pieces.  The best part is, if they're for deviled eggs there is very little chance of having broken or gouged whites.\n",

      "0 Wow!  This meat was tender, tasty and so easy to do.  I used a packet of Lipton's new Beefy Onion Soup and at the end I added a little water and flour to make gravy.  The \"secret ingredient\", the cranberry, really just made the meal.  It gave the beef a mildly tangy, slightly sweet flavor that was wonderful!  I normally don't like cranberry with meat of any kind, but something made me try this recipe and i'll never be sorry!  I served it with spoon rolls (recipe #21317)and a ceasar salad.\n",

      "0 Anu, you posted this just in time.  I have a huge amount of people coming over later today for a BBQ and wanted a simple vegan breakfast this morning.  The sandwich may be simple, but it's taste is outstanding!  I used some whole wheat multi-grain bread.  I also cut the tofu to fit the bread instead of crumbling it.  I seared it on both sides after sprinkling it with some hot pepper seasoned olive oil.  With a fresh and tasty tomato no ketchup was necessary.  I will definitely make this sandwich often, for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Thanks so much!\n",

      "0 These turned out very good.  My whole family loved them.  I was a little confused about the ounces for the honey and BBQ sauce.  My jars were ounces by weight, not fluid ounces, and I was not sure what the recipe meant, so I assumed ounces by weight.  Maybe that is the reason that my sauce was not like a dry paste rub but a thinner sauce.  The only thing I left out was the Old Bay because I did not have it.  Also, I used 5 lbs. of spare ribs and I am not sure if these are the same kind the recipe calls for.  I cooked them at 325 for 2 hours and then put them under the broiler for 10 minutes.  My sauce was very thin, not sticky at all but....they were still good and I have about 2 cups of the sauce left which I am going to use to marinate london broil :)\n",

I noticed there was no amount given for cabbage in the recipe and I had to guess. I ended up with way more filling at the end after preparing enough rolls for 6 people. I will say I think the tomato paste in the sauce must be a mis-print because the sauce ended up thick and pasty and tasted just like...tomato paste, and didn't pour over the rolls like a sauce at all. If I make this recipe again I certainly would try using tomato \"sauce\" instead, and seasoning with something, perhaps some paprika to start. Overall, a good recipe, if the sauce can be worked out. I have the extra filling in the freezer, ready to use in some green peppers topped with cheese. :)\n",

The flavors of regular potato salad is wonderful, one of my all-time favorites, but adding chipotle chile powder moved to up to another level, and the sweet gerkins were a pleasant counter-surprise to the pepper.  It was easy to make about an hour before dinner, and I let it sit a room temperature until serving time.  Another addition to my T&T book.\n",

I used soy milk to keep it non-dairy.  I also used brown sugar, which gave it a nice caramelly flavor which really complemented the pineapple.  With some high-quality vanilla ice cream it garnerd me a few compliments.  I will certainly make this again and again!  Thanks Gidget!\n",

I did have to increase the lemon juce, dill, and a tbsp. of mayo in the salad, as well as add a bit of salt and white pepper, because it had seemed a bit dry and less flavorful than I wanted and the fishiness was coming through a bit strong. But the additions did a lot for it and it tasted very good after that. I liked how the cucumber and lettuce tasted with the salad in the pita- it was very cooling- I think this would be a great lunch idea for hot summer days with a nice cold drink and some fresh fruit to boot. Good recipe! :)\n",

I'm not sure that it's a dish that all younger kids will like as well, even though it has a sweet taste; my daughter didn't seem too thrilled with it. Overall, was a very good recipe! :)\n",

I serve dit alongside Mustard Lamb Chops and it was a very nice compliment to the lamb.  I will be making this again.  I do recommend using a firm bread rather than ordinary sandwich bread - which can get a little too soggy in any stuffing recipe.  I used a mixture of white sandwich loaf and wheat bread as that was what I had on hand - next time I will try sturdier bread, perhaps Italian or a country sourdough loaf from the bakery.\n",

Usually she likes to bathe her rice in soy sauce but this she ate as it was! I did cut back on the salt a bit, as I didn't think so much was necessary. The spices in it were very fragrant and flavorful, especially the saffron, reminding me of spices of the Near East and the flavors of that region. I think if you wanted to, more vegetables could be added to make a more substantial vegetarian main dish; as it was, there were far more than 2 servings as a side dish. Very exotic and tasty recipe!\n",

This was a very fragrant dish, as you said, but was even more so after I added a sqeeze of lime just before serving, which enhanced the flavors of the chicken even more. I served this dish with stir-fried rice vermicelli noodles with assorted vegetables and lemongrass on the side, instead of the rice suggested. I used basicly the same combo of sauce that was used on the chicken to season the vermicelli. It all turned out very lovely, much nicer than something you could get at a restaurant, and very easy to make! Thanks! :)\n",

MAKE SURE YOU LET THE COCONUT FILLING COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE PUTTING IN ON THE CAKE!!!!!! Unfortunately right after I mixed it, I put it on the bottom layer, topped it with the other layer and proceeded to frost it with the chocolate frosting. The coconut layer is at least an inch thick! As soon as I started to frost the sides, the chocolate frosting would not stick to the coconut filling, it all mixed together and the coconut was oozing all over the place! To save it, I put it right in the fridge. After about an hour, I took it out and kind of slopped the sides back together. Some of the frosting was mixed with coconut and had a bumpy consistency. I put it back in the fridge and then when it was set, I frosted over the bumby parts with the remaining frosting. I will check back with a rating after I actually get to taste it. I did taste some of the filling mixed with frosted that plopped onto the plate and that was yummy :)\n",
      "UPDATE: This is an update on an earlier comment I made about PREPARING this cake...remember to let the coconut filling cool or you will have a mess! Now for the TASTE part....AWESOME!!!

This sauce is quite rich and just a little too thick - as some of the previous reviewers have suggested, I think I'd prefer it just a bit thinner - perhaps adding a little more milk next time, or even reducing some of the cream cheese.\n",

This is such a versatile recipe!  I pretty much followed the ingredients, except used 3 cups of sweet potato and 1 cup of white potato, not on purpose, I just didn't have enough sweet potato in the house.  And that's the beauty of this recipe, you can alternate, mix it up, just stay within the amounts and follow the instructions.  I started out having this with some cooked wheatberries, then used it again rolled up in a tortilla.  I finally had the last of it yesterday for lunch, mixed with some multi-colored pasta.  Next time I make it (which will be this weekend), I think I'll add some cubed tofu and some fresh champignion mushrooms.  Dancer, this recipe is truly superb, and thanks so much for posting it!\n",

Essentially, everything was done in the same way except that I used canned kidney beans instead of the dry ones. I used a frying pan to simmer everything up and it was done in about 30 minutes. Scrumptious! The spices were just right and although I thought it might be a bit dry (without any tomato sauce or something else to hold the topping together) it wasn't at all.

I used one and a half (13 ounces each) pre-made angel food cakes, 2 quarts of strawberries (I couldn't get raspberries) and doubled everything else.  Kate, I hadn't made this for quite awhile so I kept in mind what you said in your review about wanting to moisten the cake the next time...thanks :)  What I did was rinse the strawberries and then sprinkled a bit of sugar on them.  This seemed to correct the potential dryness problem.  I also refrigerated for about 16 hours, so the longer it sat, the cake probably soaked in more juices.  The picture I posted is the one made with strawberries.\n",

I seasoned mine, of course with some simple salt and pepper, and went a little heavy with the fresh sage. I did add a dallop of sour cream over the top when it was done, too! It was quite delicious that way! I thought these would be really tasty done with sliced smoked sausage or kielbasa done inside, to make a little side dish meal. Also, these would be handy to pack ahead in the picnic basket or cooler to take to a park to throw on a grill or fire there. Great for summertime cooking! Nice recipe, Bergy! :)\n",

Black beans aren't readily available where I live, so I used 1 cup of cooked red beans and 1 cup of cooked chickpeas.  It's really the cilantro that is the star of this dish!

It smelled so good while it was cooking I was lucky to have food there when it was finished (I was nibbling along the way). We were delighted to try a chole without a tomato-based sauce as we hadn't had that before. It turned out very nicely with the mango powder. The spicing in this was nice, not too hot, I think, for some to be able to go ahead and try as it is. There will be some heat, but your eyes won't be filled with tears! For others, like me, they can ramp up the heat if they wish! :) I did add some more water towards the end to keep the consistency nice and moist but that's no problem. This is a great dish to serve with curried vegetables, and nice warm breads! If I had room I'd go eat some more! Great job, Anu! Thanks for the recipe!\n",

I did not dip them in sugar...I chilled them and then dipped in melted semisweet chocolate with paraffin wax.  They were a big hit with my family, but just a tad bit too sweet for me (though still good...I think sometimes when you make something, by the time you get around to having it, you're sick of looking at and smelling it :).  I made about 4 times this amount and messed around with extracts, too.  I tried almond, cherry, lemon and rum.  I actually wrapped the cherry candy around a maraschino cherry and then shaped it...now that was yummy!  This recipe is very versatile and can be adapted for any holiday.\n",

      "0 Sublime does not even begin to describe this sauce.  I like to serve it over a chocolate brownie topped with orange/vanilla ice cream.  I use 1% soy milk and non-dairy dark chocolate.  I usually have this at room temperature and it really pulls the chocolate of the brownie and the orange in the ice cream together.  This makes just enough to serve about 5 greedy people, so when I have guests I usually triple the batch.  If you don't have orange liqueur then orange extract and some very finely grated orange zest works as well, if not better!  Thanks Lennie, you've upped my reputation another notch with this one!\n",

The only other changes I made were to add a little bit of cilantro to the fajitas and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. They turned out excellent!

I would say that if you choose certain vegetables such as bean sprouts or mushrooms which exude a bit of moisture, you might want to have a little extra cornstarch or thickener handy as it tends to water down the sauce. I did add a few drops of sesame oil to flavor mine. And after having a few bites I did succumb and go for the sambal oelek as I love spicy foods. It still tasted great, and I would recommend this dish to anyone, as it is versatile enough to serve to a group with varying tastes! Thanks, Sueie, for a lovely recipe! :)\n",

The gang all gave it \"thumbs up\".  Thanks for posting this one.\n",

I mixed half of all of the mixes together with the water, and mixed the other half of the mixes together to sprinkle over my chuck roast.  Just to make it easier on me, I popped in some new potatoes.\n",

Just for the heck of it, I added a drained canned of green chiles and served the Tabasco on the side. It turned out great, and it was so easy to prepare in a really small kitchen. Thanks Clifford!\n",

I chopped up the salami (wasn't sure what to do, cause it just said 2 slices) and used 1/2 of a 16 ounce bottle of light Italian dressing.  After the salad sits in the fridge awhile you need to add a bit more dressing, because the pasta slurps it all up and it gets a bit dry :) The addition of sunflower kernals adds a very interesting texture and flavor...never thought to do this with pasta salad but it was really good!

For my other peanut butter cup recipe you end up making balls of peanut butter dipped in chocolate. They taste great, but this is so much easier and still has that same taste to it. I will be making these from now on.  UPDATE: Let me start off with, this review is based upon my experience making them and the experience of others eating them.  (I can't eat sugar).  That said, they were easy to make - much better than the recipes were you make them into balls.  As for taste, I was told that it needed more chocolate, so next time I will make them in a larger pan and double the millk chocolate chips, however despite that everyone agrees they taste great.\n",

      "0 My daughter Adiya is still forming the balls as I write this, but I've already had a taste and I can just tell from that first Mmmmmmmmmmmm that this is something that is going to be made again, and made often.  This is incredibly simple, and delicious, well worth the, oh, let me see, 5 minutes out of your life that it takes to actually make these babies.  It actually takes a little longer, as you lovingly form the balls, but my 11 year old daughter did it all by herself.  If you deal with the boiling part and get a little helper to deal with the ball rolling, you've got it made.  A great project to do with your kids.  I took what ThatBobbieGirl said seriously and was scared to let the mixture boil.  It was just starting to bubble around the edges when I took it off the flame.  Another helpful hint is to wet your hands when rolling the balls, it's less sticky that way.  I would like to try it next time with some mini-chocolate chips mixed in.

I still am not sure if I did it correctly, but it came out pretty and it does taste good.

This is one of my favorite lunches!  I use a laffa, which is the Mediterranean version of lavosh, which I think is actually Armenian (don't quote me on that, though).  I used half parsley and half fresh coriander.  I also gave it a lavish sprinkle of za'atar.  The olives were from a local Lebanese deli, pickled with lots of garlic and lemon!  Yum!  Anyone and everyone who reads this review, make this \"sandwich\", you will love it!  Thanks Terri!\n",

I did seed my jalapeno, so if you like hot, leave seeds in or add more; if you don't like hot, don't worry. ;) The flavors of the artichokes pair nicely with the shrimp as if they were born to go together! All the other vegetables went nicely also. The cilantro gives a hint of flavor, also there is a hint of something almost citrus-like coming through, in the marinade. This is so delicious! The ramen, I did a simple pan-fry job on (you an do this after boiling, like hash browns); they went well together. There was no clash of taste. Great job, Bergy! Love your cooking! :)\n",

This sauce has a nice, well-rounded flavor, and rather chunky, too! It doesn't have the sweetness or smokiness many sauces are known for. After processing the sauce to give a better texture (at the chef's suggestion), the onion became more pronounced and the predominant flavor. I think if you want to puree the sauce you might want to cut back on the onion a bit. I think this sauce would be a perfect pairing for BBQ chicken- it has all the right qualities. I would make this sauce again, and keep a regular supply on hand. Thanks, Miller!\n",

It comes out so cool and light and the taste it beyond describing.  I find it does tend to melt in the warmer weather...so the cake does need to be refrigerated, but it is also great cold.

The nori went well also, lending a salty-earthy character which is decidedly Japanese. This dish does not have a Western flavor; it truly tastes Japanese! Thanks, Jan!\n",

      "Really unique and very tasty.  I am so proud of myself because I am growing an herb garden and I had the chives and oregano (fresh).  You didn't specify whether the sundried tomatoes were oil packed or dry, so I chose the dry ones since you had olive oil listed.  I didn't have the pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds, and that worked out well.  I loved eating this salad...no real cooking on a hot evening.  I will make this one again.  I am wondering how fresh tarragon would be instead of the oregano?  Maybe I will be brave and make it that way soon.  If I do, I will let you know how the substitution fit in.

They tasted great with a mild sweetness from the orange that went perfectly with the curry flavor, which was cooled by the yogurt. I used a mild curry powder and avoided hot because of the yogurt and thought it turned out great. I did set out some chutneys thinking they might go good with this, but when tried, the meat was much tastier on its own. But my whole family loved this, so this will be a recipe prepared again and again. Thanks, Lennie!\n",

I did find it took me a bit longer to prepare the recipe than the indicated 10 minutes (I'd allow closer to 15 minutes) but that wasn't a problem because they were so yummy I didn't mind! Not too sweet and a nice combination of spices. I made them without the icing.\n",

I quartered the recipe just in case we did not care for it, but I see that was a mistake :)  I \"rubbed\" about 4 lbs. of steak and still have some left.  This was much easier than marinating and the flavor is subtle, but delicious.  You can definately taste the cayenne...adds a bit of heat, but not TOO much.  Thank you for posting...I will be trying this on ribs next!\n",

However, I did use a little less tahini (about 100ml) than indicated and quite a bit less olive oil (about 50ml). Maybe my eggplants were smaller than the ones used in the original recipe, but I just found that the end product was so creamy it didn't need the full amount of either ingredient.\n",

The only thing I was unsure of was how small to chop the peaches.  I did mine about 1/2-3/4 inch cubes and it worked fine.  I was going to make this for July 4th and then a couple days later, but the kids ate all of my peaches both times!  Finally, today I was able to make this yummy recipe because I told them \"hands off the peaches\" :)  Thanks so much for a unique, delicious and easy recipe!\n",

Careful when cooking the mustard seeds, because they tend to want to fly everywhere! The spices were mostly in the right proportions for my taste, although I think I would add a touch less lemon juice next time. I should add as well that while I posted a photo of this recipe, it is much more of a stunning yellow colour than the snapshot shows - beautiful!\n",

I prefer freshly shredded Parmesan cheese over the kind you buy already grated that  has the consistency of saw-dust. That ingredient was definitely a plus. Just an all-around great sweet/spicy burger. Turned out very juicy. Bravo!!\n",

As soon as I'd mixed it up I knew it was too runny to stand on its own as a topping so I squeezed some of the water out. Even then, it made the paper muffin cups very soggy and the bottoms fell out of the cups as I was taking the muffins out to cool. Obviously, I'm not sure how this might change if made with canned pineapple but if you're using fresh I'd say they almost need to be eaten right away, while warm, because the topping is just too runny to stay in one place on the top of the muffins.\n",

My BH did the grilling, and we were a very happy family that evening.

We don't have American cheese where I live so I substituted a regular yellow cheese.  Instead of bread crumbs I used onion-flavored cracker crumbs as the topping.  I upped the quantities to serve 10, although our family of 6 inhaled it all at one sitting.  I see I'm going to have to up it to at least 16 next time!

      "0 I tried this soon after it was posted and it was wonderful -- both for the ease of the recipe and for its taste. Because I wanted to play a bit (and had a lot of starter to use up) I tried two versions. One as the recipe indicates and one substituting the rye for whole wheat flour. Both loaves were superb and looked great (especially the one brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with dried rosemary before baking). I'm enjoying my bread now with some soup....thanks Donna!\n",

The only flaw in the recipe is that it should mention that when you start heating up those mustard seeds you should cover the pan and not uncover it until the seeds have finished popping.  If you're not careful you could lose an eye (to quote my mother)!  This is a great main course or side dish!  Thanks Dancer!\n",

I made it again about a week later, with less oil and with the lemon juice, and there wasn't a single morsel left, not even a hint of black olive!\n",

At our house we are always fighting over the hard crunchy bits, and this way ensures that there is enough, more than enough, for everyone!  I actually combined everything together, macaroni, eggs and cheese, and fried up little pan-fulls, so everyone had an individual portion.  Those of us who like more crust had more crust, those of us who like it more soft and pillowy, well... you get the picture.  My only change to the recipe was to add a healthy dose of paprika and some freshly ground black pepper.  Troy, where has this recipe been all my life?\n",

All of the measurements proved very accurate.  I covered the chicken while it cooked with the shallots & the peppers (it took about 8 minutes for the chicken to finish cooking for that step).  The only change I made was the amount of butter - I reduced it to 2 tsp. and used a nonstick skillet, which I would do again.  I served the chicken over steamed rice with a simple salad of fresh multicolored bell pepper strips with olives tossed in a vinaigrette dressing. (See photo)\n",

I used only 3 drops and the smoky flavor was just not complimentary to the rest of the recipe.  I feel that without the liquid smoke this would be an excellent recipe.  I also feel that the balls would hold together much better if the cauliflower were first steamed and them mashed into the recipe.  The mushrooms and the green peppers should be minced finely, otherwise the balls will fall apart, since there is no egg to hold them together, only oatmeal.  I will definitely make these again, only this time I will leave out the liquid smoke.\n",

      "0 I made these today for my daughter and her friends, they enjoyed them. That dropping trick did work to make the brownies more dense, but it did not make these brownies more chewy, but had a tightly packed cake texture. The cinnamon taste is very strong in the brownies, and I had thought about going with less, but decided to go with you on the first try. The next time, I would drop to a teaspoon of that. And on the icing, there was way too much, I would go with about half; I have a tub in the icebox now (although my daughter promises to eat it! LOL). With the nuts, I didn't flake mine, but chopped them finely, and found that 1/2 cup was sufficent to cover a whole pan.\n",

      "0 I was attracted to this recipe by its bold use of chiles: the 3 tbsp called for equalled about 9 Thai Dragons and I used every one, although the end result was less powerful than I imagined, and I ended up adding Sriracha hot chili sauce to keep the barn burning. I did not have the \"Mehoon\" type of rice vermicelli, but used the normal type, and opted to cook it according to package directions and allow it to drain well. The flavor of this dish is excellent, it reminds me of one I had in a Viet restaurant with rice noodles- something tasting like shrimp fried rice overall (if you have never tried a noodle dish), but the heat will come through depending on how much chiles you opt to use. I don't think many chiles are necessary at all to enjoy this dish, and my favorite part was the touch of browned onions used as a garnish on top. I noticed for leftovers, I was running low on the browned onions, and that I will be having to cook more, so if you plan to eat all of this at one sitting, you might want to cook double the amount of that red onion cause it is quite tasty. The flavor of the spinach holds up to the noodles, but is not overpowering in this dish, and I think it is a great way to get your iron. Thank you for a wonderful dish, this will be part of my regular collection.\n",

The rice was very, very good - and was a nice compliment to the chicken.  The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I only wished there was some sauce to go with this dish, and that it looked a bit more colorful (everything looked beige). Next time, I will serve this with a honey mustard chili sauce drizzled over the chicken, with extra for dipping.  The only thing I did differently this time was to use fewer mushrooms and I accidentally used a whole chili pepper, not just a tsp (which I would do again, as I like things hot).\n",

I let the beans simmer probably more like 6-7 hours to get that ultra soft bean texture. The seasoning was just right, not too hot but hot enough you knew you were eating some great creole cuisine.

Working with the caramel and coconut topping was difficult.  I couldn't get it to stick to the cookie.  Be careful with the topping because it is very hot and you have to work quickly with it before it starts to cool down. The recipe probably made double the amount of topping that was really needed. I think the Samoa cookies have a thin layer of the caramel & coconut topping but my cookies have a big, round glob on the top. I probably won't make these again, unless specifically asked to, because of the amount of work involved in them.\n",

I will certainly be making this over and over again in the next few months, until Miller presents me with another \"find\".  Thanks Miller, you always do right by me!\n",

I spread it atop rolls before baking and it make them look lovely with all the bits of dried herbs - this makes ordinary rolls look special.  I made a half batch and was able to brush this butter glaze over 25 rolls.  I may try brushing this mixture over fish or chicken next time as well.\n",

She predicts they'll have a shelf life of 3 minutes from the second she offers them a bite.  The only change I made was that I ground up the flour, oatmeal, sugar and pecans together, then mixed in the margarine.

      "0 This dish was heavenly! I used jumbo shrimp because that was what I had, but those tasted fabulous. I used a ready-made red Thai curry paste in my dish; I chose it to complement the colors in the tomatoes, and it tasted great. I did chop that onion! And I added the tomatoes just before the sauce started to simmer. I used a fresh tomato instead of canned; it's easy to peel tomatoes, just score the end, drop them in boiling water till the skin loosens (about 45 seconds or so), then plunge them into ice water- skin comes right off; halve the tomato, gently squeeze, and no more seeds! It's so easy! I also served this with Thai dragon chiles- it's as if the taste of the dish was made for them! The flavor was slighty sweet, typical of great Asian curries, not overpowering of coconut flavor, and not too spicy. All in all, a great tasting, easy dish, that is suitable for entertaining as well as everyday use. Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Bergy!\n",

I made it the night before a school potluck, refrigerated it, but by the time I served it, the twinkies had absorbed all of the strawberry juice and turned to mush. I brought home 3/4th of the 9 x 13\" pan.  I guess my recommendation would be to make this only a couple of hours in advance so that the twinkies don't get mushy.\n",

I used two red bell peppers, which made the dish bright (I had them on hand) but I think 1 red and 1 green would make this very attractive. My Chinese noodles didn't have a seasoning packet included, so I improvised and added 1 tbsp of minced fresh ginger and I did cook the noodles according to package directions. Other things I did was to use Chinese napa cabbage, and also added fresh garlic (generous, of course) instead of powder, and increase the soy to 2 tbsp. I finished the dish with a final stir of another tbsp of minced ginger to keep the flavor bright and added some Mirin. I toyed with condiments at the table (soy, etc.) and the best one was Ponzu sauce teamed with Nanami Togarashi (Japanese ass't. chili pepper) which really heightened the flavor of the dish to absolute pleasure.

I multipled the recipe for 16, and my only change was to add some cinnamon while it was cooking.  The house smelled heavenly!  This is a fantastic side dish, a wonderful complement to roast beef or brisket.  I've made many different versions of tzimmes before (usually based on carrots), but this is the first time that the sweet potatoes (I used those instead of yams) had a starring role.  Next time I'm going to add some pumpkin or butternut squash to the mix, it can only get better and better!  Thanks Bergy, it was worth the tzimmes to make the tzimmes (tzimmes means troublesome in Yiddish)!\n",

      "0 Yum, yum, yum was this tasty.  I have tried beer breads before, and for some reason, this one tasted especially good. I did not have Alaskan beer, so I used a German Kolsch instead.  nlike most beer breads, which often come out looking rather lumpy and bumpy, this baked up into a pretty brown loaf with a very crispy crust and a tender, moist interior.  The smell is so wonderful - everyone was coming into the kitchen wondering what the great smell was.  Delcious!  Gone in 10 minutes flat.  One word of caution:  don't overmix your batter or it can get hard (this is from experience making beer breads) and this is more of a tearing bread rather than a slicing bread..don't expect nice, neat slices.  Also - when you first slice into the bread, you may notice wet streaks that at first appear to be undercooked bits - they are not, but rather are pockets of beer dampened bread that taste amazing.  Really great beer bread!\n",

We live in Texas and need more heat in our food (to fight the heat outside!) - thus I will try the idea of chili sauce instead of ketchup, or I also thought about Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes.

      "0 This was very good, and quite easy to make! It reminded me sort of like an iced mocha, but with the taste of iced chai in it. I used reg. granulated sugar because I didn't have caster sugar and it dissolved ok, and worked out fine. I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the frappe because I like to add that to my chai (personal preference) and I think it tasted nice! Although I didn't mix it up as such, I think this would mix well with ice cream. Thanks for a lovely recipe, Evie*!\n",

I copied Inez and used new potatoes (although not straight from the garden, rather, straight from the supermarket).  I didn't use any cheese because I was serving this with chicken and don't mix meat and dairy together for religious reasons.  Still, without the cheese, these were amazing!    I used a gourmet onion soup mix and some extra-virgin olive oil, and these potatoes sang!  I can just imagine how wonderful they would taste with the Parmesan!  Next time, I promise!\n",

I used a mild muenster cheese instead of the mild mozzarella cheese (that's what I had on hand), and it was very good.  I also used the Land O Lakes Fat Free Cream in place of the heavy cream, and it worked well in this recipe.  Thanks Bergy...it was terrific.  It is a keeper.\n",

You really have a wonderful, tasty, beautiful, and certainly easy recipe.  It is worthy of any \"top-drawer\" restaurant.  Thanks so much Bev....a keeper!\n",

It made more than the 1/3 cup called for, but I tossed it in anyway.  It only improved the recipe, in my opinion, extra-corny.  I also used soy milk because I did not want this to be dairy.  I served it as a side dish with some gravy-ful chicken, and it sopped up that gravy beautifully!  I can't wait to try it again, this time with some onions and red peppers, lightly sauted until soft and then mixed in.  Thanks for a winner!\n",

My husband is from Milwaukee and up there they like to BBQ brats by simmering them on the grill in the brew then browning them at the last- this is quite a lot like that. He quite approves, and was very happy to hear that I was cooking brats as part of the cookathon and I can say that with this recipe I made a very good choice! Thanks for a great recipe, Bergy!\n",

These were very good, although the instructions were a little vague, which knocked off a star.  I didn't know whether to steam the whole thing in a steamer over water, or cook it in a bain marie.  In the end I combined it all and baked it at 350 degrees F, placing the casserole dish in another dish and pouring boiling water to come halfway up the side of the dish.  It worked like a charm!\n",

      "0 I made this as part of my 9/11 anniversary dinner.  The only time I ever find butter pecan flavored anything is when I'm in America.  I love the flavor combo, so this really means American to me.  I made a non-dairy version of the cake, subbing soy milk for the milk in the cake part of the recipe, and using a carton of Rich Whip, since we don't have CoolWhip where I live.  The cake baked beautifully and I got lots of oooooohs when I brought it to the table.  Friends who had stuffed themselves silly on hamburgers, hot dogs and coleslaw suddenly found some space in their stomachs for dessert.  Just one note:  Instruction #3 -- Watch carefully near the end to avoid burning -- this should be in bold, flashing, Las Vegas-style letters, you have to watch very carefully, the pecans toast fast!  One minute you have this wonderful smell in your kitchen, and if you're not careful, you'll have the fire department coming to investigate that burning smell.  I rescued mine just in time, it was hard not to pick at them before I folded them into the cake.  Yooper, thanks for the great recipe!\n",

I used fresh herbs instead of the dried and they gave a lot of color to the dish since you have to use more in substitution; otherwise I think a bit of parsley might be pretty. I used all the veggies called for in the recipe but next time I think I might try a potato/onion/garlic/herb mix; there are so many possibilities! Besides the pot roast mentioned, I think this would also go great with roasted chicken. This is a recipe I will use again and again. Thanks, Bergy, for a great recipe!\n",

I must admit I was a little worried about how thick it looked going into the pan and thought it might dry out the noodles or get pasty, but it didn't! I can see how broccoli soup affected the flavor and the taste of the dish would change every time with a different flavor of cream soup (lots of possibilities here!).

Fresh figs are in season now and I bought some gorgeous ones at the local fruit and vegetable market.  I just couldn't wait to try them out on this recipe.  Only when I got down to the nitty gritty of actually cooking the dish did I notice that the recipe called for dried figs, not fresh ones.  \"Too late,\" I thought, and forged ahead anyway.  I am so glad I did.  This recipe must be delicious with dried figs, but fresh figs really makes it sing!  I gave the figs a whirl in the food processor and squeezed as much liquid as I could out of them before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  The figs, together with the apples, almonds and honey make this a perfect dish to serve on Rosh Hashana!  Another winner from Dorothy!\n",

I ended up baking it way longer than called for to get the sweet potatoes where I get get a fork into them, and by that time, the apples had gotten too mushy (and I did use the Cortlands). I did try tasting it, the apples had a flavor of lemon (even with the cider in the pan), and were a bit tart. I tried sprinkling with some cinnamon and nutmeg and drizzling honey over it all, and that did help tone that down some, and bring out some flavor. I think maybe the apples should be cut larger (in wedges) and those sweet potatoes cut thin, and do prepare for some honey or brown sugar on the apples at least. I think maybe that could help this recipe work.\n",

This is very similar to the Jewish hamin or cholent, and like those dishes I placed all the ingredients in the slow cooker late Friday afternoon and cooked it on low until we were ready for lunch around noontime Saturday.  The aroma of the pastrami mixed with the molasses and brown sugar pervading the house all Friday night while we slept gave us amazingly sweet dreams!\n",

I served this over potato gnocchi, which it complemented nicely.  I think next time I will opt for the tarragon vinegar instead of the balsamic vinegar - I felt the balsamic tasted just a little too pronounced in this. But it was still a very good recipe - worthy of a place on a restaurant menu.  I grated fresh Paremsan cheese over the top and drizzled with a smidge of truffle oil as a garnish.  If you are a fennel lover, you will enjoy this dish very much.\n",

If you can get the harissa I heartily recommend it, the chili peppers are a poor substitute.  If you do use chili peppers you should whirl them around a bit in the food processor to get the saucy texture of harissa.  I completely left out the black olives and the capers (well, it did say \"to taste\", and in our house that means \"none\".  Thanks, Friedel, I'll be making this again, for sure!\n",

I bought one at the grocer while grabbing the other ingredients and put this one together really fast! I used an Asian dressing by \"Walden Farms\" called \"Oriental Dressing\" which is both fat and calorie free and it worked perfectly in this salad- I don't know if that is available to everyone, but it's worth looking for. I also used a salad mix called \"Asian Greens\" instead of baby spinach, but it contained mostly spinach anyway, and it was great! This salad does remind me quite a bit of the one that Wendy's serves called Mandarin Chicken Salad but this is much better. But I think this salad would also work well with mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles as substitutions in the salad in stead of mangoes and peanuts. Overall, this was a very healthy salad (I took the skin off my chicken and kept light on the nuts) and I know I will keep it as a part of my regular routine, when I need dinner in a hurry!

      "0 This is an intensely satisfying dish.  It is satisfying to make and just as satisfying to eat.  I had a wonderful time choosing the vegetable that I would put into the stir-fry, it smelled wonderful while it was cooking, and it was delicious.  This definitely should be filed under the category of Comfort Food!  I multipled the recipe to feed 6, so used more of the ingredients and the cooking time was longer.  I used zucchini, tomatoes, onions, carrot, red peppers and canned button mushrooms.  The recipe assumes you have already-cooked egg noodles, if you are cooking them from scratch you should add some more time for cooking.  Making this dish from scratch is just a tiny labor-intensive, chopping the vegetable into tiny bits, grating the cheese, stirring until the vegetables are tender.  However, you could make this very quickly using fresh pasta, pre-cut veggies and pre-grated cheese from the supermarket.  I also found that a dash of salt and pepper was not enough flavor for our family, so I added about a tablespoon of mushroom soup powder.  If you are following the recipe for 2 servings, I would suggest about a teaspoon of the stuff.  I also added a healthy dash of paprika.  MG, this was a pleasure to make and even more of a pleasure to eat.  I'm so glad I made lots, because now I have something wonderful to take to work tomorrow for lunch!\n",

      "0 When I was a little girl my mother used to take my brother and me to the supermarket.  To keep up from driving her crazy should would get us something to nosh on while she pushed us around in the cart.  My brother always had something potato chippy, but I was happy with some raw string beans.  My love affair with green beans has continued to this day and I adore practically anything with greenbeans, especially if they are roasted.  Needless to say, I adored this dish, not just for the green beans, but for the combination of ingredients which made this truly a superb side dish.  I actually roasted the green beans on one of those top-of-the-stove ridged roaster pans.  I used a garlic and chili pepper infused olive oil, the smell was heavenly!  I tossed them with half walnuts, and half pine nuts.  Instead of oregano I used za'atar, a Middle Eastern spice.  Together with some fresh feta it was an adventure to eat.  The flavor combinations are Middle Eastern/Mediterranean, you almost feel like you are sitting by the Mediterranean Sea, feasting on this salad, with a cold glass of white wine with which to wash it down.  Bev, this one is a winner!\n",

The yogurt sauce with dill was nothing short of scrumptious. I did as you suggested and placed pancakes on a bed of salad greens. I didn't serve with salmon but with some grilled boneless chicken cut into strips. It all looked so beautiful on the plates. I topped with some fresh chopped chives and pepper. Thanks so much ;D\n",

They really are no-fail noodles - I rolled them out a little too thick,and then got distracted while I was boiling them in broth, but despite all that - they STILL turned out  delicious.  Once the noodles were prepared, I droppd them into boiling chicken broth and let them cook like pasta for about 15-20 minutes. They were wonderful and I can't wait to try them again  - I think they will taste great with beef stronganoff ladled on top.  Next time, to save time, I may run the dough through my pasta maker.\n",

Oh - they were just the most delicious things I have ever tried.  The measurements are very accurate and I made no substitutions - everything worked out just as described.  Don't worry when you are mixing up the batter if it looks like there is hardly anything in your bowl - the dumplings grow huge upon baking and start out very, very small. I was worried at first about the large quantity of liquid that gets poured over the batter before baking - but never fear, the amount is perfect - as the dumplings grow, they absorb most of the rich,sweet syrup sauce and it comes out just wonderful.  One note: I did set my pie plate on top of a rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips.\n",

      "0 This is quite a delightful dish, with lots of sauce. I went half on the chicken on mine and substituted some vegetables in its place and that was nice. The beef bouillion was interesting, I hadn't seen that before, but you know, it worked! The wine was not overpowering in its amount since it reduced. The curry powder I think you could be variable on in amount; I think 3 tbsp. is probably moderate, but one could go heavier easier, or lighter if they wished. I used a mild Madras type but my husband complained that I didn't used a hotter curry powder but he likes it hot. The peanut butter is not overpowering, and if you like a heavier taste of peanut butter, as in Indonesian dishes, you might like to increase that, but even so, it was fine as it was. The thickener was dead on. The coconut milk lends a richness to the dish, of course; be sure not to use the sweetened type. I am interested to try this with shrimp sometime; also with other vegetables, as they go nicely. Great dish, great eats, nothing left but the smell in the kitchen. Thanks, Canarygirl!\n",

The ingredients were all things that I keep on hand.  To kick it up sometime, you could add a dash of chile powder and cut back on the sugar.

Your recipe is exactly how I make sausage with peppers and onions, trying to duplicate that boardwalk taste.  Half of our family skips the sauce...they are good both ways.

I goofed and used a bigger size can of artichoke hearts, which I thought was fine, as I love artichokes.  I also went heavy on the garlic.

Future notes to self: the substitution of soured milk for buttermilk works fine. Although less rich, margerine works fine. I ran out of paper cups, & the 5 muffins without them did stick badly - but not so much that simply spraying the pan wouldn't work. I need to sift my dry ingredients. The batter was lumpy, & unlike most muffins, didn't \"come out in the wash.\" I think next tume I will brush honey on right out of the jar - I didn't use nearly what the recipe called for. I really should stop baking new things early on Sunday when I am feeling under the weather. :) Can't wait to try these again!\n",

I cut the carrot and the pumpkin into little dice, and the aroma of the veggies sauteeing with the onion and the sage is out of this world.  Please make an effort to use the fresh rosemary, it's perfect for this soup.  I also used 1 sprig of fresh thyme.  I used vegetable stock and soy milk powder instead of the skim.  Instead of pureeing it all in the blender I used an immersion blender and pureed it all to a light orange creaminess right in the pot.\n",

I wasn't thrilled with the aroma in the beginning, but it got better as time went by :)  I used a potato masher to smush the onions and garlic before I added the other ingredients and this seemed to work well (I did not want to have to deal with pureeing!)  I used a 12 oz. can of Bud Light, because that is was my hubby drinks, hope this was the right size can!  I simmered mine for over an hour, stirring occasionally, which made for a lovely textured thick sauce (ended up being 3 cups).  I used it on chicken legs that I was grilling and they came out delicious.  Before I could try it on the ribs, the whole bowl flipped over and I lost the rest of the sauce in the grass!  But...I am sure it would have been great on the ribs too :)  Thanks!  I will be making this again.\n",

I marinated for a couple hours and then grilled over low heat (any higher and they caught on fire.)  They looked and smelled scrumptious and we could not wait to eat them.  I finally moved the chicken over to indirect heat so it would not burn but cook through and closed the lid on them for an hour.  After cooking this way, they should have been done, but...they were raw inside!  So....I ended up puttiong them in the oven for an hour and we finally got to eat them!  \n",

I haven't decided whether or not to reduce the added water next time. Very filling and economical, also easy. I served it alone, but a green veggie would balance it nicely.\n",

I have a suppy of frozen bananas in the freezer (where else would I keep frozen bananas?), and together with the ice cubes this was a wonderful slushy breakfast!

They all asked for the recipe, and since it was soooooo simple, I was able to just recite it right there at dinner, and they were able to remember it all without writing it down.  I only managed to marinate the chicken for about 4 hours, but it was just fine, I can imagine that 24 hours would be amazing.  I did use the lemon pepper but also added some paprika, which melded with the yellow of the lemonade and gave the chicken a lovely orange color.  The sugar in the lemonade does make the chicken more likely to burn, so keep it over a low heat and let it cook slowly, it's worth the wait!  Another winner from MG!\n",

      "0 Um Yum! This was delicious! 48 pieces of wrapped love, 1 for you, 47 for me...hehehehe. These have just the right tartness and flavor of great Middle Eastern food. I want more! When I went to buy the grape leaves (calls for 1 jar), I saw 3 sizes available: \"Might be the right size\", \"Looks like it could be a mistake\", and \"Definitely feeds King Kong\". I picked the 1 pound jar which worked out great (and as it turns out, has about 50 leaves in it). I didn't have any citric acid, and thought about using lemon juice, but remembered seeing some at a brewing supply place that sold wine-making supplies, so I waited till I got that. It was very inexpensive- less than 1 dollar for a bottle (people might check the phone book for home-brewing supplies). There also wasn't a 100 gram can of tomato paste available; seems the 8 ounce (170 gram) is the smallest you can get. I used half in stirring into the rice mix. When it came time to mix the 1/2 tbsp. into the water, I just added the rest of the can (why waste the rest?), and what I did was stir it into some water and pour it over instead of seeing some lump sit there in the pot. The taste was wonderful. This seems perfect to go with kebabs. Next time I make those kebabs I will have some of these to go with. Thanks Mirj, and your neighbor for this nice recipe, I'll lock it in a safe. But really, I have spent far too long sitting here without eating a Yaprach. I gotta go. :)\n",

I made these for breakfast yesterday, together with some French toast, and the French toast lay there forgotten while the Dornettes clamored for more banana fritters!  I cut the bananas into large round slices, not in half, and added a little nutmeg to the batter.  I shallow fried them in butter, and they were heavenly.  We had them with various toppings, honey, maple syrup, but chocolate syrup won the popularity award and will now be the official topping for our banana fritters.  Evie, these are the best!

The results were fabulous...super cheesy, but the pasta was firm enough that the dish was not a mushy mess, like some layered pasta dishes turn out.  Thanks much for the recipe...I know I will be making it often.  P.S. Don't know how, but I actually got to take a picture of it before they ate it all up!\n",

      "0 Made this tonite and it was soooo easy.  The texture is wonderful, a little heavy, almost a brownie like texture.  It is not overly chocolatey or sweet, which was perfect with the buttercream frosting I used.  I did not have a square pan, so I used a 9\" round pan and it took 30 minutes.  Very good recipe for a quick, snack cake!  Thanks :)  P.S.  I am posting a picture which I am sure will not do it justice, but you can still see it looks pretty tasty.\n",

I think the amount of chillies might need to be adjusted though, depending on which type you use. I used half as many as this recipe called for, deseeded, and there was still plenty of heat in the dish. Also, I might cut the amount of water down a bit next time - say to four or five cups - since I found the soup was a touch thin when I added the coconut milk. I didn't have fresh coriander and basil, but stirred in some store-bought pastes, which worked just fine. \n",

I marinated about 6 hours and grilled for about 20 minutes on medium on the gas grill.  Then I turned off that side of the grill and left it for about 15 minutes in indirect heat. Served with scalloped potatoes and corn and everyone enjoyed.  Thanks for an easy marinade to spruce up usually bland (and tough) london broil.\n",

I knew I had a good thing going right away, and made enough for dinner tonight and leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Then I put the chicken back in the sauce.  Now, with a thicker sauce, it coated the chicken nicely.  I used 3 bone-in skinless chicken breasts.  Rice would make an excellent side dish.\n",

I have a hoard of Skor bars that I brought back from the States, and this recipe looked like it was worth breaking into my stash, and it is!  My only changes to the recipe were to ground the pecans finely (that's how we like them) and for the coffee portion I used the Taster's Choice Vanilla flavored coffee, and it was intense, and really made these bars sing.

I had not expected my husband to enjoy this as it contained several ingredients he strongly dislikes (namely rocket and feta).  However, he enjoyed this dish.  Our only question was how much lime juice to add - I added the juice of just one of the limes, tasted it and thought it was plenty.  Unless you really want a potent lime flavor, I recommend going light on the lime juice at first and keep adding until you are happy with the amount.  If you don't like feta cheese, it is easy to omit (which I did for my husband), as it is added as a garnish at the end.  Thanks for a real gourmet dinner!\n",

I didn't have any chocolate-flavored sweetened condensed milk, and really wanted the chocolate flavor Heather promised, so I mixed a tablespoon of very intense chocolate milk powder into the milk.  These are perfect washed down with a frosty glass of milk, which my daughter did.  I don't drink milk, and believe a superb vintage of Diet Coke did the trick just fine.\n",

I started in the micro and then moved to the oven, since I had chicken cooking in there at high heat anyway.  I normally do not go for hot tomatoes, but this almost tasted like pizza.  Me and my 12 yo daughter (the only tomato eaters in the house) scarfed them down!  Thanks for a new way to use tomatoes. P.S. Posted a picture, but it does not do them justice.  They are nice enough to served for company.\n",

The couple of kids who do not like those types of cookies did not care for these either.  This was fairly easy to prepare and I got 40 cookies out of the recipe.

Mozzie cheese, tomatoes and basil, one of my favorite combinations, and wonderful in this dish!  I used fresh basil from my garden, and added some za'atar seasoning (hyssop).

I'm finding that with meats cooked in a slow cooker that aren't covered in some type of sauce, it is better to brown the meat a little before putting it in the slow cooker. I think this is especially true for pork. Pork that isn't browned before going in the slow cooker turns out a little grey and ashen in color.  I will make this recipe again and brown the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.\n",

I added a little more garlic (our preference), and used some fresh basil, oregano and parsley as they were calling out to be used here - otherwise followed exactly. Loved the flavor.  DH is typically not fond of pasta, but said he wanted this again soon.  Thanks.\n",

This chuck roast was fall apart tender.  I used 1/2 packet Italian dressing, but a full packet of Ranch, and a full packet of mushroom gravy (was out of beef gravy).  Coated the roast and put the rest of the seasoning into the broth - I used a can of beef broth instead of the water.  Put potatoes and carrots in with it.  Cooked on high for about 4 hours and low the rest of the day.  Not at all salty.  DH and DS didn't leave any left overs!!!\n",

I tried adding even more cold water, but that only diluted the lemon further and it still was very sugary.

Since we do not like cottage cheese, I used ricotta.  I also added salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to spaghetti mixture and salt and pepper to meat sauce.  When the family heard the name of this recipe, they were leary, but they went nuts over it!  Served with a crusty loaf of Italian bread and butter.  Thanks for the unique recipe.\n",

I have 2 suggestions...one is that I added some salt, pepper and Italian Seasoning to the cheese mixture and it had a great flavor.  Another is when you buy your mozzarella cheese, do not get  fancy finely shredded.  That is what I did and the top got a little too brown (which I personally liked :).  I am sure if I had regular shredded cheese, it would not have browned so quickly.  Oh, I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, because we prefer it.  This is a definite keeper and I will not make lasagna any other way from now on.  P.S.  This was not meatless for us, as I used Prego Mini Meatball spaghetti sauce!\n",

      "0 This dessert was very tasty.  Followed the recipe to a \"T\", however, my crust did not stay together too good.  I was not sure if the butter should be cold, softened or melted, so I went with softened.  Another problem may have been that my walnuts were chopped too large.  This was a little more work than I anticipated, with 3 layers to mix and 3 bowls to wash, BUT it was apparently worth it, because everyone loved it.  The layers are good, but the walnut crust really makes the dessert!  Thanks for the recipe! P.S.  I bought an 8 ounce tub of Cool Whip and barely had enough to frost the top.  I would suggest buying a 12 ounce tub in order to have enough.\n",

I pounded out the boneless breasts to about 1/4-inch thick, and used fat-free dressing and fat-free Pringles sour cream and onion chips for the coating. Because I pounded the chicken thinner, it did take more chips to coat (about 12 oz. total). Since they were fat-free chips, I went ahead and spritzed the top with a little oil, and baked as usual (it came out at 19 min.). They turned out crunchy and golden and flavorful.

The wine was not strong either, it mellowed out and was not noticable at all except that it gave a nice complexity. It was easy to make, especially with an apple peeler/corer/slicer. Those make quick work of apples! This is definitely a dish to make again! Thanks, Miss Annie, for a wonderful dish!\n",

I baked this about 15 minutes longer than called for. This was the most enthusiastic my saughter has ever been for a Zaar recipe! She came back for THIRDS! She loves this, and so does everyone else.

Don't forget to grease and flour the bottom of that pan! And it came out of the oven right on time. It has a wonderful taste of pumpkin with coconut as well, and is very moist from the pudding mix. It definitely melts in your mouth! A keeper even if you have a prized pumpkin bread recipe stashed away! Thanks, Mysterygirl!\n",

      "0 This was very pretty to look at, easy to prepare, and tasted good.  I did use the tripack noodles with the seasoning packet and did not add any additional ingredients(although I did use some of the optional ingredients suggested by the recipe poster- namely extra veggies in place of the cabbage and I did add the mirin).  The noodles didn't heat up much in the microwave, so I cooked them just a tiny bit longer.  I think I would definitely prefer to cook them according to the package directions first next time - in liquid, then drain off the water before using.  I think the optional splash of mirin is a key ingredient as it adds some much needed moisture to the dish.  Next time, I will use fresh garlic rather than the powdered, and follow some of the suggestions mentioned by SueL in her review of this same dish.\n",

      "0 These came out very good and they were pretty easy, too.  Even my son, who hates cheesecake, went for these.  I was unsure if I should swirl the cheese mixture into the batter, because this is the only way I've ever seen this type of brownie done.  Since the recipe did not say to swirl, I didn't.  I think I may try it next time, though, because although these are quite tasty, the top almost looks like macaroni and cheese.  The cheese mixture got a little brown and when I took them out of the oven (after only 30 minutes), my husband said \"I thought you were making brownies!\"  I used a large brownie mix (for a 9x13 pan) and made it in a 8x10 pan (I do not own a 9 x 9 square pan).  I was not sure what size brownie mix, but when I saw the cooking time, I figured it was the larger package cooked in a small pan to produce a thicker brownie.  All in all, I was happy the way these turned out, but I am still not sure if I prepared them correctly!\n",

I only grated half as much as called for and added about two teaspoons of the resulting mixture to a pint of water. That was plenty of ginger taste for me! Also, I had a real problem peeling the lemons. The rind just wouldn't come off so I zested them instead.

I used this on a First Holy Communion cake and I had enough to frost a half sheet cake plus color the remaining with food coloring and pipe around the outside and write with.  I also only had to use 1 1/2 lbs. of sugar to get the right consistency.  Thanks!\n",

      "0 Oh, this is so tasty warm from the oven, drizzled with golden syrup and oozing with a pat of butter on top.  This is very similar to Irish Soda bread, but has a different taste.  Don't expect to neatly slice this bread - it is more of a tearing bread.  I made it in the oven and it came out great - would love to try it camping using the campfire method sometime as well.  I did knead the dough briefly on a floured board, but only about 1-2 minutes as it seemed ready to bake by then. My family devoured the entire loaf in under 5 minutes and everyone enjoyed it.

At first I was worried there wouldn't be enough stock to cook the potatoes in, before the pot boiled dry, but it worked out just right and I'm glad I resisted the temptation to add more liquid. I blitzed the soup at the end, just to make it a bit smoother. \n",

A couple suggestions if you make these: watch carefully, because I left mine in for 18 minutes and they probably should have come out a bit sooner.  Also, the frosting recipe makes A LOT!

I served it with hot cornbread and nothing else...ahhh!!  I think you could convert it to the crockpot too, if you wanted.  Thanks Nez, for sharing this one!!\n",

I stumbled across the review Celine posted and was so touched by the online love story between Celine and the recipe poster, Scar Tissue, that I HAD to give this recipe a try.  I am so glad I did - it was the loveliest looking banana loaf I have ever made and was very moist and tender. It tasted wonderful! I think that any spiced tea(such as Constant Comment or Earl Grey) would work equally well if you don't have any Chai flavor tea on hand. Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe and for sharing your beautiful love story!  Hoping for the best for you both.\n",

      "0 I have made this recipe twice now, and due to my sidetracked nature, I keep forgetting to review it. The first time I made it, I did it pretty much exactly, except for forgetting to salt the onions, and using too much broth & not enough Guinness in the second addition of liquid. The second time was more of a mess, since I accidentally simmered the pork cube steaks that I used at too high a temperature, and used too much Guinness (trying to make up for last time??). I also skipped all the flour dredging, trying to make it lower carb, and forgot to buy fresh parsley. This recipe is great for hiding such failures in culinary expertise. I also have to remember that it *is* time consuming, since each time I have made it, I ended up eating an hour later than planned. I shall have plenty of time to perfect my technique, though, since hubby insists that I make it often. Thank you!\n",

I really thought I would love this recipe as I like all of the ingredients very much and it was an interesting sounding combination.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the ingredients all together just didn't taste right to me - I really didn't like taste of the honey mustard with the powdered sugar and the jam all on the same ham & cheese sandwich.  I don't think I would make this again.  I am sorry-perhaps this will suit someone else's tastes better.\n",

First, I don't know what streaky bacon is, so I used the kind that we get here and omitted the vegetable oil as it wasn't needed.  Second, I used a pound of homemade breakfast sausage and cut it up in chunks.  Because these have a lot of fat content, before I added the beans and the beer, I drained most of the fat off of the dish.  I enjoyed the flavor and the ease of making this dish.\n",

Also, I had problems removing them from the baking pan, so I would suggest spraying the pan or drizzling butter over them before baking.  To my taste, the 1/2 tsp salt called for was not enough.  Perhaps not adding the salt to the flour and instead sprinkling them with salt before flouring them would result in tastier wings.  I also baked them at 425 degrees for the same amount of baking time to make them crispier.\n",

In Germany, they sell pans especially designed for making this dish that unfortunately aren't available everywhere.  When sliced, this should look more like a flat, square slice of pizza.\n",

There are many spaghetti pie/lasagna recipes, which may have perhaps led you to anticipate that this recipe would also be something that you would cut and serve.  This is different - it is a baked pasta casserole, similar to baked ziti, only using spaghetti and of course a different sauce.  It is actually not supposed to hold together into a square - you would serve this using a spoon.  All of your suggestions do sound tasty as well, but I wanted any one else who wishes to try this to realize that it is meant to be a casserole. You may also use a large deep oval casserole to bake this in with no alteration in cooking time.\n",

As for the heat, it certainly builds on you but it's not overwhelming. The only changes I would make are to the amount of stock -- I think about 3/4 of a quart would suffice -- and also to the cooking time. This took me closer to 35 minutes to prepare. \n",

My pizza stone was just a bit to small to fit all of them on at once, so I used a very large cookie sheet lined with foil and it worked out just fine.

This is an easy to prepare, tasty and elegant salad.  One note: On the tv show, Nigella used \"baby gems\" in place of mixed greens - which are mini romaine lettuce heads(you could also use \"hearts of Romaine\"), which she tore up into chunks, but the mixed greens Kylie suggests above are obviously good as well.

It only took about 35 minutes to bake it.  The aroma of the bread baking was heavenly!  I served this with Beef Noodle Paprikash and steamed broccoli.  It was a delicious meal.\n",

If I were going to experiment, I might add about 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke just to see if I liked a smokey flavor too.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Karen!\n",

I used one small jar of chopped roasted peppers, drained,and thought it was the just right amount (about 1/2 cup). The flavors all blended very nicely.  Be sure to add enough salt and pepper - I was pretty lighthanded with the seasonings and next time with be more generous, but that is no fault of the recipe.  I will definitely make this one for guests if I know they are zucchini fans.  Great recipe!\n",

      "0 This was incredible and should be called \"To Die for Roast Chicken\"!  It deserves extra stars.  I used a 7.5 lb. chicken (I buy them big because we have a big family :) and doubled the stuffing.  Everything about this is great...the gravy, the stuffing and the chicken itself.  Before I had this, roast chicken was a boring meal around here.  Now I can't wait to have it again!  I never roasted a chicken with the breast down, but I think this was the reason the breast meat was so moist when it is usually dry.  I cooked it breast down for 1.5 hours and then flipped it over until it was done.  My chicken was an oven stuffer roaster with a pop-up timer and I thought it might not pop after being upside down, but it did and the chicken was done to perfection...color gorgeous and skin crispy.  The kids were not overly fond of the stuffing because of the lemon zing, but it was perfect for me and my husband.  (By the way, I did not double the lemon rind when I doubled the stuffing).  One thing that was odd...we did not taste any apple, but maybe that was just my apples (granny smith).  Oh, and for anyone who is using a bigger chicken like me, I did not double the butter that was rubbed over the chicken.  There was the perfect amount to cover and I think the butter is one of the reasons that the gravy is so good and a rich golden brown.  I cannot thank you enough for sharing this recipe, Sharon...it was just awesome!  I'll shut up now :)\n",

I got 4 rolls out of mine and had a little strip of plain rice krispie treats left, which did not go to waste.  I still got 48 out of the recipe, since it was a 12\" wide pan and you cut each of the 4 rolls into 1\" pieces.  I used sour neon gummy worms (only needed 3-4 in each roll, and they were overlapping a bit) and strawberry fruit by the foot (needed 8 rolls).  The kids loved them and the flavors actually go well together (I thought they would be kind of yucky...oh no, I am turning into a kid after eating them! :)  Anyway, thanks dayla, so much for posting this.  I will be making this over and over again for parties, bake sales, etc.  P.S.  I would suggest letting the mixture set for a couple minutes before pressing into pan.  Then allow to set a few more minutes before attempting to roll...my first roll was a bit messy.\n",

      "0 I don't know why, but I decided that after almost 20 years of making my mom's recipe, I felt like a change.  Made this today, Sunday, for dinner.  Simmered longer, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It is close to my mom's but not quite it.  Her meatballs have parsley and Italian seasoning and she doesn't dredge.  These meatballs were good, but I think I am used to hers :)  The gravy (or sauce as I call it) was wonderful...again, close to mom's, except this one has no salt or pepper (which I admit I thought was odd, but I didn't add it!) or cheese in it.  So, after the novel I just wrote, I still think this is very deserving of 5 stars.  The whole family loved it, didn't really notice much of a difference and they are soooo glad there are leftovers!  Served over linguine with garlic bread.\n",

I had never had this dish with orange juice and peas in it before and thought these ingredients complimented the dish very nicely. Easy to prepare,clear instructions, filling, and tasty results. Notes: I used real sherry rather than cooking sherry (which I find too salty) and I also used freshly squeezed orange juice rather than the concentrate, as that was all I had on hand.  I would repeat these changes as everything worked out perfectly.  (See photo).\n",

I used some of the spice mix as a rub and mixed the rest with the water before pouring it over the meat.  I added chunks of new potatoes, onion and carrots to the crockpot as well.  We still have a favorite pot roast recipe though.  Try the Cranberry Pot Roast on this site.  It's been a favorite for us ever since we first tried it.  I'll keep this recipe in my file.

It is a bit high in carbs, and not my personal favorite, but I will probably keep the ingredients on hand for those emergency nights. One note, I remember the original recipe called for some kind of veggies instead of the Chicken & Rice soup, and I really hated the rice in it, so I might make that modification next time. I did use the onions, since I had some in the fridge. I also stirred half of the Chinese noodles into the mixture & sprinkled the other half on top (another distant memory).\n",

      "0 After hearing Richard wax rhapsodic about this recipe in person, and reading all the wonderful reviews (except for Karen's, which was just posted), how could I NOT try this out?  In a word:  YOWZA!  Just a few changes -- after sauteeing the garlic and onions in a saucepan I dumped all the sauce ingredients into my crockpot.  I made up the meatballs (without the cheese) and just plopped those right into the sauce, no browning them first.  No Italian sausage in the vicinity, so I used some hot Moroccan sausage.  I started this all early in the morning, switched the crockpot on low and went off to work, swearing all the time I could smell it cooking across town.  About 9 hours later I came home to find 2 Dornettes and various friends drooling in the living room.  It was torture waiting for the pasta to cook, but we were well rewarded with the most astounding weeknight dinner we've had in a long time.  My vegetarian Dornette practically wept with frustration, but still managed to stick to her principles in spite of the most amazing aroma coming off our dinner table.  I've got plans to double, even triple the recipe and keep batches of it in the freezer for those times when I need my fix!  I may even take pity on veggie-daughter and make up a batch with soy meat and soy sausage.  Yo Richard, you really know what you're talking about!\n",

The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.\n",

I needed 2 3/4 cups of crumbs and had to take out of the oven early, because the crust and crumbs started to burn a bit...10 minutes probably would have been perfect.  After they cooled, it was a quick 5 minutes to put together and then into the freezer it went (right before dinner).  By the time dinner was over and coffee was brewed, it was just firm enough to eat!  It is a little hard to get out of the pan, so I would suggest dipping the bottom of the pan into hot water for a few seconds before cutting.  Thanks so much Ginny for another great recipe :)  \n",

      "0 This were pretty good wings! I must say you have some hard judges coming from here. These didn't turn out as crispy as promised, and I tried making this recipe TWICE just to make sure. The blue cheese dip is phenomenally DELICIOUS!!! ...DO NOT skimp on that and buy bottled dressing or you will just miss out!!! But I will say that it does make loads (and I used Saga blue cheese which was wonderful), but something went wrong with the dip overnight and it got really watery so I don't recommend making that in ADVANCE. I don't know if it was the particular cheese or what. But anyway, the spicing on these wings is nice, but I still enjoyed having an extra dipping of hot sauce on the outside- it tastes more intense that way. So if I am a little down on the wings for not having \"Colonel Sanders extra crispy\", don't feel bad, I DO LOVE the dressing and recommend that everyone go out and make this whenever they are making hot wings, without fail...it is from the bible of dipping sauces.

I didn't have any packed brown sugar, so I used 1 1/4 cups of a golden granulated sugar, plus two tablespoons molasses. The cookies are crunchy and soft at the same time -- pure heaven, as the name suggests!\n",

By the time dinner was eaten and dishes were cleared, our dessert was almost done.  I flipped it out onto a dish and we cut pieces off of it and added a dallop of vanilla frozen yogurt!  YUMMY!  The walnuts make this special...I left mine in pieces instead of chopping and biting into one was a treat.  I needed 3 apples and used 1 granny smith and 2 golden delicious.  Thanks for posting this VERY unique and yummy dessert.  It is great that it can be made right on the stove top!\n",

These are a snap to make, but they spread quite a bit - be sure to leave plenty of room between each cookie on the baking sheets or they will spread together while baking.  This makes tons of cookies.  The touch of lemon and the richness of the butter make these so tasty.  Also - check them early as they remain very light yellow when cooked - if you overbake a batch, they develop a brown ring.  After the first batch, I knew to pull them out at exactly 9 minutes for my oven.\n",

The only thing I wasn't overly thrilled about was the look of the potatoes that were stuffed in the chicken.  They tasted great, but they didn't look as good as the ones roasted around.  I may make all of them outside next time, but other than that, I am so glad I tried this recipe.  A little extra effort makes a plain old chicken into an elegant meal!

      "0 Made this for my family, who love meatloaf.  I am not a meatloaf lover myself, but have to admit that this was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  Smelled great cooking and the rest of the family could not get enough!  All I heard was \"Awesome\" through the whole meal.  I used 2 lbs. of 85/15 ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My mixture was VERY wet, to the point that I could not even shape it, but I just kind of poured it into the loaf pan and the texture after cooking was fine and it sliced great without falling apart.  Took about 1 1/2 hours to cook through since it was larger.  Thanks for the great recipe...unfortunately, there was none left for sandwiches :(\n",

      "0 These were so good I could not stop eating them!  I was a little worried about using weight measurements instead of volume, but the the texture was just right.  I used margarine, which I almost never do, and it did not effect the taste at all.  I got exactly 3 dozen cookies and they took 10 minutes in my oven.  One thing I should mention...these cookies spread a lot and they were huge.  I would definitely space them 2 inches apart.  This dough would be great to make ahead and freeze, so you can just slice and bake!  Can't get much easier than that and these are just sooooo good :)  Thanks for sharing...these are going on my Holiday trays this year for sure!\n",

I don't think any flavor was especially strong, which kind of surprised me because I thought either the garlic or brown sugar would dominate.

I also expected the ginger to permeate the flavor more fully - I think perhaps mincing the ginger pieces might help spread the ginger flavor so that with each bite you would get a burst of ginger flavor.  Still, this really was very tasty and I will certainly make this again.  The drizzle of hot chili oil at the end was really a nice touch.\n",

If you follow the measurements of each ingredient as directed, the dressing comes out far too sweet and lacking in seasonings, despite the hefty punch of fresh garlic and the fresh cracked pepper.  I felt it needed salt or perhaps some fresh herbs to give it a more rounded flavor, and far less honey.  I think this recipe shows great potential - next time I will experiment with adding additional seasonings - perhaps a minced shallot as well, and reduce the honey to just 1 tsp.\n",

Still, it's yummy, and a great recipe to pull out of the hat at the last minute. I used a can of \"Fun Favorites\" that I had on hand (the one that has the pouch of candy coated chocolate & sprinkles). I added the colored bits just before pouring into the pan, and they mixed in without melting. This makes me think you could add red & green sprinkles if you wanted a more \"Christmasy\" presentation.\n",

      "0 Delicious, excellent side dish!  This bakes up into a tasty, attractive looking casserole that would look great on a Thanksgiving table or as part of any food holiday meal.  This was easy to throw together and tastes great.  Mine cooked very quickly - I pulled it out of the oven after 40 minutes.   I also used Swiss cheese, as I was out of Cheddar - can't wait to try it with the Cheddar next time.  I was able to get 8 servings.\n",

      "0 A great week night family casserole.  I was looking for a comfort food casserole last night and chose this recipe.  Then I realized I didn't have kidney beans and bowtie pasta, but I did have black beans and macaroni.  I was real pleased with those substitutions.  I added a little cumin and cayenne pepper (we like our spice) and at the end, put it in a baking pan, topped it with some cheese slices and melted those for a few minutes in a 350 oven.  Very yummy.  We're looking forward to the left-overs, and I'm sure this is one of those dishes that is even better the next day.  We'll make this again.  Thanks, NurseDi.\n",

My husband and I added it to a small amount separately and we liked the zing it gave the meat.  I never thought to make this with beef cubes, I always used a chuck roast and had to shred until my arm fell off!  My store sells chuck roast and beef cubes for the same price per pound, so this was  a time and money saver for me!  I have a 6.5 qt. crock pot and it took 5 hours on low.  I mashed the cubes and then left the lid off for about an hour, stirring frequently, to thicken up the sauce.  This was really excellent, thanks for sharing!  P.S.  I added a tbl. of Worchestershire sauce and salt and pepper.\n",

      "0 These were fabulous!  I cannot give them enough stars and there are not words to explain how they taste...you just have to make them.  Everyone loved them, they look gorgeous and are a definite for my holiday trays from now on! I have, or had, a favorite cookie recipe and this one just topped it! I had a couple minor problems with preparation, so here are my suggestions to anyone who runs into the same.  Do not let this stop you from making these, they are sooooo worth it :) 1)My dough needed to chill much longer than one hour because it was very sticky and the first batch spread too much. I would suggest at least 3 hours.  2)My filling kept stiffening up solid even after warming a couple times in the microwave, so instead of making an indentation in the cookie (which would not stay in anyway :) and spooning the filling in, I took a half a tsp of filling, rolled it into a ball and pressed it deeply into the center of the cookies. 3)I would make them smaller than the 1 1/2 inches.  After the first batch, I started making them about 1 1/4 or so and they looked more like a sticky bun, plus they did not spread as much.  I would have only gotten about 22 cookies if I would have kept making them large.  P.S I could not find dark corn syrup so I used light, and then subbed brown sugar for the white.  This may be the reason I encountered some of the problems I did, however the taste was great and the problems ironed out easily :) I did not use the egg white wash because the dough was just too soft and fragile...but we didn't miss it.  These took 6 minutes in my oven for the second stage of baking.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Sharon for sharing this new favorite cookie recipe!\n",

      "0 I really didn't care for this at all.  I did like the idea of a pasta salad with a sweet/sour dressing, but this was just way too sweet for me.  It was so very sweet that I couldn't eat it.  I also thought there was way too much dressing for the amount of solid ingredients.  At first I thought there may be an error in the measurements, but I have found similar recipes to this that call for the same amounts of seasonings, sugar, and vinegar.  I think the combination of flavors in the dressing could be very tasty if toned down a lot.  I am sorry - the recipe poster obviously enjoys this salad very much, perhaps you will too if you enjoy very sweet salads.\n",

There is no amount of cinnamon listed in recipe, so I just added what I thought was needed , about 1 1/2 teaspoons. Turned out very good  will be making it again.\n",

It looked lovely with the bright red pepper strips and the blend of flavors was just right.  I chose to drizzle a little hot chili oil over my portion to give it some fire.  I did decrease the amount of cooking oil in the recipe to just 1 Tbsp, which I thought was plenty.  (Also, where the directions say to shred the pepper & chicken I thinly sliced them into strips.)

I found the dressing measurements to be a bit off balance- I think next time I would reduce the salt and the lemon juice, adding it only to taste.  The full teaspoon of salt made this too salty and the lemon flavor was a bit too strong. Even so, it was still a very flavorful, tasty salad and I am certainly planning to prepare this again, but just adjusting the salt and lemon juice.  \n",

      "0 Diane, you've saved my life!  I don't drink milk and was never a fan of \"white\" sauces, so therefore never bothered to eat or to learn how to make biscuits and gravy.  Well, one day i got a strange craving for them and attempted to make the gravy four times.  (This was before i found the 'Zaar) I used sausage, bacon, broth... nothing i did came out right.  By the fourth try i had given up and thrown it on the table, as is.  My husband and son scarfed it down saying it was great.  Puhleeze!  I know they just didn't wanna see me cry.  I couldn't even go near it!  And then one day, while searching for something totally unrelated i came across your recipe.  I took it camping with us and everyone we potlucked breakfast with loved it.  I've made it at least every other weekend, if not more, ever since. It's easy and so delicious!  And, i'd even venture to say \"foolproof\"!  I like to make it with the Sage flavored Jimmy Dean sausage, and i've found that using all milk (just slightly less of it) works fine, if you accidentally don't realize you have no cream on hand before you get started.  LOL \n",

I prefer the taste of fresh basil to the dried, but the dried was still very tasty in this.  I would highly recommend measuring the oil to taste instead of accurately measuring out 4 Tbsp - you might end up with too much if you do.  I also added just a sprinkling of sea salt and a grinding of black pepper over the top just before serving as a garnish.\n",

I halved the recipe for our family of six, and although the little ones were not thrilled about the basil, the rest of us just loved this.  Served with an Italian dinner and it went with it wonderfully.  Very tasty...thanks for sharing!\n",

      "0 Thank you all for your very nice comments about my recipe!  I have noticed that several folks have tried this with boneless chicken breasts instead of the bone-in parts called for in the recipe.  You may certainly do so, if that is what you prefer, but please be aware that boneless chicken will cook in far less time than parts with bones.  If using boneless breasts, I would start checking the chicken for doneness at 20 minutes and I imagine it would take no longer than 30 minutes to cook.  Also - for those of you who enjoy a thicker sauce, I recommend pouring the remaining cooking liquid into a small saucepan and reducing it for a few minutes on medium-high heat - stirring and watching carefully so it does not burn. You could even add a few spoonfuls of cornstarch to some a small amount of cold water, then whisk that misture into the dripppings and reduce in a small saucepan if you prefer more of a gravy texture. I usually just set all of the chicken onto a serving platter and pour some of the cooking liquid over it.  Enjoy!\n",

I spread a little of the sauce on some boneless chicken breasts and broiled them a few minutes on each side.  Then I sliced them and added the chicken slices to the pasta.  I substituted 2 cups snow peas (cooked for about 2 minutes in the water with the pasta at the end) instead of the broccoli and topped the dish with matchstick carrots (also slightly cooked in the microwave) instead of the cucumber.   Unfortunately my family is not used to different Asian flavors and did not care for the peanut sauce.  I'll make it again for me, though, and freeze individual servings to take for my lunch.  \n",

      "0 Thank you Bev, for such an easy recipe!  Just got a Belgian waffle iron for Xmas, and the recipes that came with it were horrible!  I was going to return the thing when I decided to check 'zaar for better recipes.  I came across yours, and because one of your recipes is an all time favorite of mine, I figured I could not go wrong with your waffles!  They came out wonderful.  I made them plain this time and got 12 waffles out of the recipe.  In my waffle maker (Salton) I needed slightly less than 1/3 cup batter or they were oozing out the sides.  I had to play around a bit to get the perfect amount, but once I got going they turned out wonderful.  They kids had them with butter and syrup AND then had them with ice cream :)  I can't wait to try them with the add-ins! Thanks a bunch!\n",

I assembled it according to directions, and looked at it and said \"OMG it's just YELLOW!!\". BORING LOOKING! I probably would have passed it up at the buffet table (BUT it tasted good). So for \"eye\" appeal, I quickly sauteed coarsely chopped red and green peppers, wedged onion chunks and sliced baby portabellos. I then tossed it in the prepped casserole with an 8 oz carton of sour cream, and baked as directed. Well, the color just added something to the dish, that had tasted great before. My coworkers devoured this dish in no time flat!I will definitely make this again.\n",

I find that one cup of water [250 ml] is a bit dry in my breadmaker and I get the best results with 350-400 ml. I suspect this is the reason that the dough formed a ball in the bottom of the pan and baked that way - it was too thick.\n",

I did go onto Gail Gand's web page and the recipe is correct as written.  I am not sure what the problem is...they taste fabulous (not gritty at all) but are too sticky and gooey and won't hold their shape (even after letting them firm up overnight).  I think I may try freezing them and then cutting and dipping in chocolate.  Maybe that will hold them together?  I think this has potential since the flavor is so good...maybe a temperature would help?  P.S.  I used light cream, since the recipe does not specify and I did warm it.  It took 10-15 minutes WITHOUT stirring to get the sugar to the amber color and do be careful when adding the butter and cream...the sugar goes crazy and bubbles all over :)\n",

I followed the recipe poster's suggestion and used 1/2 milk, 1/2 white wine in the sauce, which I would do again as this added a nice flavor.  I needed far less liquid, however, than called for - it made the sauce for the filling a bit too thin (although still very tasty).  The potato topping came out a bit too thick for my liking- I was tempted to add some milk to soften them more, but didn't, as I thought perhaps the potatoes might be intentionally thick to better absorb some of the delicious filling. Next time, I will add some milk. My family also commented that they would love to have this fish pie again, but with some additional ingredients added to the potatoes (I usually add a little white Cheddar and garlic to mine)as well as double the amount of prawns.\n",

They have a wonderful flavor- I added about an extra 1/4-1/2 tsp orange zest.  It's amazing how yummy they are and they're great with tea too.  Not extremely moist or anything, but still quite tasty, sweet and with a very unique flavor.  I would definitely recommend letting the cookies cool for a while before removing them from the sheet, they can crumble easily when still warm.  I had a hard time rolling the dough into balls, however, disks, which would be easier to form would work equally well.  The dough is so dry, however, that rolling it between your hands is not an option.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and to apply the powdered sugar I rolled my cookies in some that I poured in a bowl as the sprinkled sugar did not seem to adhere.  Overall, a great recipe for a flavorful teatime cookie.  Very unique and delicious!\n",

The recipe is very easy to make, I used red potatoes and sliced them VERY thin, but still had to add an additional 30 minutes for this to be cooked properly. The only thing that did was to drive me crazy waiting to get to them because the smell coming from my oven was heavenly. Thanks Inez for the great dish!\n",

Everyone at the table raved over the flavor and I can't believe how good this turned out for being so easy.  There was not a strong mustard flavor, which I was worried about.  Everything blended wonderfully together.  Thanks for an easy but yummy way to prepare usually boring old chicken! (P.S.

I only got 26 out of the batch, but they were THEE best 26 pierogies I ever made...best we've ever eaten actually!  For the filling I made 6 servings of instant mashed potatoes and added a cup of cheddar cheese and the onions sauteed in butter into them (had extra filling but that was even good by itself!).  Everyone at the table sounded like they were in heaven.  It did take me about 1 hour to fill and boil, and then another 15 minutes or so to fry in butter but it was well worth it!  Thanks for the great recipe! P.S.  I also used a fork to crimp the edges and for the first time no filling escaped!\n",

The spices gave it that nice dark tan color without any tomato sauce in the recipe.  I'm used to cooking beef stew for a long time to tenderize the chuck and blend the flavors, so I was surprised how tender the small pieces of beef were, and how flavorful the stew was in such a short time.  I used my butcher's recommendation for a \"chuck tender\" that I had never tried before.  It was very lean and delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing this \"keeper\".\n",

All of the flavors in the dish worked together pleasantly. I think the sauce would be versatile in other dishes too.  I wonder how spicy Italian sausage would be in this dish?  When I find out (and I will) I will let you know!  I was so excited to find this recipe.  Thanks for a great party dish.\n",

I found that the fresh flour tortillas absorbed so much of the liquid they became too doughy.  Evenso, they tasted great because of the wonderful sauce.  We loved the filling, too.  I will use spicy green chili peppers next time - but that is just a matter of our spicy taste preference.  I highly recommend this recipe.\n",

Mashing the kale and potato together is essential. I have never seen oats used so this is a less essential step. As a vegetarian I now cook the rookworst separately when I make this for my FIL because kale is one of my favourite cold climate comfort foods. I like to add lots of butter to my portion of the mash. Dad used to add a touch of white vinegar at the table. I have never tried mustard and nutmeg with this but I would expect it to be good,particularly the mustard.FIL doesn't seem to protest this version that's for sure! \n",

I had scaled down the recipe because when I looked at the metric conversion the recipe seemed too big for the pan. I scaled everything down by 2/3. what I had forgotten is that while fluids have a 1:1 conversion ie 250 ml of milk weighs 250 g in the pan, the same can't be said of flour. So the 960 ml does not equate to 960 g but rather 600g. [Duh!] So I made the recipe with the same amount of flour but less of everything else.\n",

      "0 I was so excited when I saw this recipe in the database, especially since we have a holiday coming up in which we eat a lot of dried fruit and dried fruit-based dishes.  I had a few questions about how the fruit should be prepared (cut up, left whole), and precisely what the chef meant by orange juice concentrate, since I know that this can mean different things in different parts of the world.  I never really got any answers from the chef and attempted to make this based on what I could figure out on my own.  I cut up the fruit and mixed it with the rest of the ingredients, not changing a thing.  During the first 20 minutes at 200 degrees C the top already was starting to brown.  This is probably due to the high sugar content of the fruit and the orange juice concentrate.  I covered the cake with a sheet of silver foil and continued to follow directions, lowering the heat to 175 C after 20 minutes and then 20 minutes after that lowering it to 140.  It didn't take long till I could smell the cake starting to burn.  I took the cake out after only an hour and a half instead of leaving it in there for the 2 - 2 1/2 hours called for in the recipe.  I'm sure that if I had just left it in there on the timer I would have had either a fire in my oven or a black, charred mess.  I was very sorry to have to throw out the cake, I wish there was some way I could have salvaged it.  Dried fruit, especially a whole kilo of it, can be very expensive.  I wish that Missy had at least answered my questions before I tried to make this cake, maybe it would have come out better.  I will not be trying this one again.\n",

We used boneless, skinless chicken breast halves and added a third one.  I did not have to adjust the rest of the ingredients - there was plenty for all three breast halves.  I served this with rice and a salad.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  \n",

More is not better however as the raw garlic really does have a bite. The second time I used cream which gives it a softer edge, used only one clove of garlic which was perfect and used a little bush tomato sauce to replace the water and a little tomato puree. As a result I am upgrading my 4 stars to a 5 stars. In fact if I could add another star I would. My toddler loved this latest version. And seeing that smiling face covered in pasta sauce made me very happy indeed as she is going through a picky phase.\n",

It was a bit hard to incorporate the apples and walnuts into this mixture and I had to spread and pat it into the pan instead of pouring it, but it ended up turning out wonderful.  It is so loaded with apples and has a great texture.  Thanks for sharing! P.S.  I needed 45 minutes and I baked in a glass pyrex dish.\n",

      "0 This recipe couldn't have been in the database more than five minutes when I decided I needed to make it right there and then.  I've always made my couscous with chicken broth, never even thought of using orange juice and cinnamon.  Let me tell you, this is outstanding.  It's got a whole 'nother flavor, and I love it.  It uses ingredients that I always have in the house, I always have a few bags of couscous lying around the pantry and orange juice concentrate in the freezer.  I mixed up a batch of orange juice, heated it up in the microwave and within 2 minutes had everything mixed together.  The only con in the whole recipe is you have too wait about 10 minutes while the couscous absorbs the liquid.  I left out the sultanas because my kids refuse to eat things with \"bugs\" in it.  I can see this as a starch alongside some Moroccan chicken, or even as the basis for a couscous dessert.  Good one Missy, I can see myself making this one often!\n",

      "0 This is very good!  I thought the chicken came out so moist and tender, although it took quite a bit longer than 30 minutes for me.  After 30 minutes, I turned the heat up a bit more to help it along and it still took 15-20 minutes more.  I took the recipe poster's suggestion to season heavily and chose to use seasoned salt and freshly cracked pepper.  I thought the flavor was very good and I would make this again.  My only problem, besides the timing, was getting the \"gravy\" to thicken up enough, despite using the whole milk as called for in the recipe.  Next time, I will mix a little cornstarch or flour with some cold milk, then stir that in towards the end of the cooking time to help thicken the sauce.  Note:I skinned half of the chicken pieces before browning and felt there was no sacrifice to taste.\n",

I doubled the sauce ingredients as I am a girl who likes sauce on her pasta. I used canned DICED tomatoes as I felt it would look better and had only half and half so I used that instead of heavy cream, with no ill effects.

I chose to make muffins and they puffed up so huge and lovely - so chock full of dark navy blue steaks of blueberries - really, I can see why she calls this \"Blue\" berry cake!  These looked just like coffeehouse muffins but tasted much better.  Note: Make sure you grease & flour the muffin tins very well - including the top of the pan, as the when making muffins, the tops grow over the sides a big (to create that great coffehouse look)and they can be tricky to remove.  I let mine cool 30 minutes before attempting to retireve them from the pan and then gently loosened the tops and sides with a butter knife.  One for the permanent recipe file at home for sure.\n",

      "0 A delicious recipe that is a complete meal, low cal and low fat, too.  I used extra lean ground turkey breast (because I've got to start watching fat and cals), and I added about a 1/2 tsp dried thyme and about a 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to help compensate for the reduced fat flavor.  I thought these additions worked very well.  In my oven, it took about an hour to get the rice done.  The cabbage was cooked just right at this point, too.  Even DH, who is not a ground turkey fan, nor a cooked cabbage fan, gave it a 4 star and went for seconds (that translates to 5 star in my book!) \n",

Every Monday I cook a rice dish and I can see this one becoming a favourite especially when zucchini are plentiful. It is a very buttery dish and the taste reflects this. A few extra herbs would not do any harm as it is a quite mild dish. Parmesan or some kind of tasty or sharp cheese is needed to provide a little contrast. I liked the crunchy rice touch and my toddler loved the carrots and the crunchy rice as well. It is a very more-ish dish and it goes down very easily.\n",

In fact, I believe I will use a little less stock next time - we enjoyed the crispy part more than the soft part in liquid.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  We enjoyed it.\n",

I wasn't sure about the proper ingredient, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid instead of the puree.  We will definitely have grillades again.  Thanks for sharing.\n",

Notes: I added a dot of butter and a grating of nutemgs in the hollows where the core had been, before wrapping each endive piece in the ham.  I also used grated Gouda cheese rather than Cheddar, as that was what I had available to me. Delicious, unique dish!  \n",

      "0 A wonderful salad.  I have a recipe similar to this, and to tell the truth, I love this one better as it uses frozen peas.  I think the mayonnaise and sour cream flavored with dill and onion is terreific.  I didn't use light sour cream or mayonnaise, as I wanted to try the recipe as written, but next time I think I will experiment.  The bacon gives a nice crunchy flavor that goes well with the peas.  Thanks for posting your tried and true recipe.  I will be using this again.\n",

I love the method of cooking the chicken quickly in the broth and I thought flavor combination was great.  Overall, it was really tasty and the directions are quite precise & accurate.  Next time I will reduce the amount of fish sauce, as it was just a bit too salty for my liking, but not enough to alter my opinion of this fast, tasty, and filling soup.  Thanks for sharing!\n",

I sliced them very thin to ensure they would cook.  The only problem I had was that the baby carrots were still a little crunchy, even after all of that cook time and being tightly covered.  Don’t get me wrong...they were so garlicky and delicious, we ate them all up, but I think next time I will either slice up regular carrots very thin or just leave them out completely and cook seperately.  Or maybe try another veggie...I love brussel sprouts, too!

I hope it stores well in the fridge.  Even though I halved the recipe it made a lot of shot glasses worth!\n",
      "I dissolved the sugar in the microwave and added it to boiling water on the stove.  While the spices were boiling the whole house smelled wonderful!  I did leave out the vanilla because I used Stoli Vanil (vanilla flavored vodka).  I also plan to use this spice combination with plain boiled water for a pot pourri for the house!  Everyone came to the kitchen to see what was cooking - the younger set was disappointed to learn they wouldn't get any. \n",
      "The drink was soooo smooth and flavorful.  I served it warm.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, so I could discover it. \n",

I had some day old bread machine brioche left over that I used for the bread crumbs.  I used only 2 tbsp  butter to saute the garlic, and then I used a little olive oil to brown the steak.  The recipe was still great and had a lot less saturated fat.  I cut the cooking time down by using the pressure cooker.  Some of the bread crumbs had cooked out of the beef rolls into the beef broth.  Before serving I whisked it all together to make a delightful gravy to serve over the beef rolls.  DH is used to my recipe reviews - after a few bites, with his mouth full, he just held up a high \"five\".  Thanks for sharing this, TammieV. \n",

      "0 This past summer I invited Caryn and her husband Steven to a barbecue dinner in our garden.  Caryn (of course) asked what she should bring.  I (of course) said nothing.  Caryn (of course) did bring something, she brought this salad.  I took one spoonful, and after that I just basically parked the bowl in front of me and had 1 grilled chicken breast and 2 gallons of this salad for supper.  Dessert?  No thank you, I'll just have more salad.  Since then I've had it several times in Caryn's house, and I adore it.  I'm so pleased she posted this recipe here at Zaar, now I can have this salad anytime I like (I was running out of excuses why I kept inviting her family over for dinner on a constant basis.  Caryn thinks it's because we're good friends, it's really because of this salad).  I had half a purple cabbage in the fridge, and half a green cabbage, so I combined the two.  And I double the pecans, they are my favorite part.  I made this on a Friday afternoon for Saturday lunch, and Caryn very wisely suggested that I keep the salad, dressing and pecans separate and mix them just before serving.  This is good advice and you should all take it!  Caryn, I love you dearly, but not as much now that I can make this myself!  ;-) \n",

Since there were children at the meal I used 2 cups of onion soup broth instead of the wine and water.  One warning:  make sure that the chicken is dry before you start browning it.  I had just washed the chicken and put it straight into the hot oil.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  It splattered all over the kitchen.

      "0 I was so excited about trying this bread after reading so many 5 star reviews, and Inez's recipes speak for themselves in any case.  However, I was disappointed in how unmanageable the dough was, incredibly sticky and it rose so fast and so high.  The resulting bread from this batch was delicious, although very crumbly.  I spoke with Inez, initially I thought I had done something wrong.  After reading her suggestions, and the suggestions of others, I decided to try the bread one more time, this time adding some more flour if the dough was too sticky.  I also made sure that I used the amount of yeast that Inez called for (I checked with her about the weight of American yeast packages).  Again, the dough was very sticky, I couldn't handle it at all except to scrape it into a pan.  Again, it rose at an alarming rate, especially in the over, where I thought it would get to high and collapse over the pan.  Again, the bread itself was delicious, but very crumbly.  So the recipe initally gets 5 stars for yumminess, but I took off 2 stars for the difficulty that it gave me.  Inez, I'm so pleased that this works for you and for others, keep posting your amazing recipes.  I'm sorry I couldn't rave over this recipe as I have with other recipes of yours.  You're one of the most respected chefs here at this site, and I guess this is just one of those cases where \"it's not you, it's me\"  ;-)\n",

      "0 My family enjoyed this dish. I didn't think it tasted anything like the Yakisobas I have eaten in Japanese restaurants, but it was still good.  I found the directions to be a little confusing.  The amount of sauce is much, much more than you will need for this recipe.  You are only supposed to add 8 ounces of the sauce to the pan(the full recipe makes about 3 1/2 cups), but even that was way too much. I hesitated to pour in the full 8 ounces, and chose instead to add some gradually and test - about 1/4-1/3 cup was all I felt was necessary.  Also - if one dumps all the veggies, meat,noodles,and sauce into the pan at once,as directed, then the pan gets overcrowded.  I had to work in batches, even though I had a very large pan.  I think this would work better if the meat were cooked alone in just a little of the sauce first, then removed to a dish to keep warm, and then stir fry the veggies in small batches, adding a little sauce as needed, then the noodles, etc, and combining everything together when finished.\n",

The Cool Whip frosting was light and not so sickeningly sweet like those buttercream frostings. Thanks for sharing this recipe. A hit with both kids and adults.\n",

They are VERY different from any cucumber salad you have had. I used the lemon juice opposed to the vinegar I figured it would be more authentic that way. I love them plain, on tossed salads and on a whole wheat roll with red peppers, shredded carrot, sprouts with a smear of lite salad dressing.

The flavor of the olive oil is very noticeable though - I am not sure I cared for it in these rolls.  The exterior does indeed get quite crisp, and the interior was soft, but not as dense and rich in flavor as expected.  I found these to be very similar in texture to refrigerator biscuit dough when cooked, although with a very different flavor. A good recipe,and certainly healthier than other roll recipes,but not a favorite for us.\n",

      "0 If you could ever call food beautiful-tasting, this is it!  I've been making challah forever, and I'm always looking for a new recipe to vary the tastes.  Yogi, this is my new recipe, and I'm not going to give it up too soon!  These make such soft and tasty rolls!  I made up a batch last night.  I took them out of the oven at 9 PM!  PM!  Way after dinner time!  All twelve rolls were gone by 10:30 PM!  All of a sudden, people in my house got the munchies, and we had a sandwich party.  I have quickly made up another batch this morning to have challah for the weekend.  And quick is the operative word here, since the dough rises very quickly, but it doesn't have an over-yeasty taste.  I made the dough substituting soy milk for the milk and the water.  Milk gives bread such a soft and delicious crumb.  I also punched down the dough and let it rise a second time before shaping and that last rise.  Last night I made them into the twelve rolls called for in the recipe, but this morning I braided them into two challahs, and I'm going to have to hire armed guards to keep watch over them so we can have some bread with dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  Yogi, this bread rocks, and so do you!  \n",

As expected, leftovers on the second day were even better and the pasta had absorbed most of the liquid.  Next time, I will thicken the broth with tomato paste or cream.  For our tastes we prefer a creamier or thicker sauce with pasta.  Great \"clean-out\" recipe.\n",

While the flavor was quite tasty, I found the sauce a bit too thin and not quite as rich as expected. Also, even after cooking the pumpkin for the full alotted time, it was still too firm after step 11, and the sauce was still rather thin. I had to let it cook at least another 10 minutes and still felt it could have stewed even longer to allow the flavor of sauce to meld with the pumpkin more. Even so, I really enjoyed this dish and look forward to making it again.\n",

After an hour and a half the loaf tested done (a knife inserted into the centre came out clean) but when I pulled it out of the pan the loaf flopped. I realised afterwards it was cooked enough for the knife to come out clean but still doughy enough that it wasn't cooked. I think part of the problem is that there was too much batter for the loaf pan. Most loaf recipes I have leave a bit of space at the top of the pan but this one made much more batter than you would expect for one loaf. I assumed the long cooking time would compensate for this, but I was wrong. Next time, I will separate the batter into two loaf pans and bake for less time.\n",

I didn't use Swiss cheese in the end because my kids don't like the flavor.  I also left out the onion juice, which I can't buy in my country, and the Worcestershire sauce, which we don't like.  The kugel stood up well without these ingredients.  The sour cream made it especially rich and delicious.  I will be making this many times in the near future!

I used heavy cream, as I didn't have any Devon cream (aka clotted cream) - I thought it was just perfect.  The directions were very accurate and clear, but do be careful when preparing the sauce - that pan has been in the oven and you will need to use an oven mitt to touch the handle or you will burn yourself.  Elegant looking, delicious tasting, and very simple to prepare.  Thanks!\n",

The sauce is not heated before serving,and the residual heat from the pasta did not really heat it enough.  I'm very sorry,but this just didn't work for us.\n",

I added the zucchini, celery, carrot, onion, and sweet red pepper since they were the only veggies not addressed in the recipe. No matter, the chili turned out great.

I think the trick was the parboiling before filling, followed by a shorter cooking time in the oven than other stuffed pepper recipes I'd tried previously.  I thought the filling was also delicious - and unique.  I had never thought to include beans & BBQ sauce in stuffed pepepr filling before and really enjoyed the flavor.  These also looked great.

      "0 This is an amazingly divine dessert!  Ever since I got my Microplane Zester this past summer I've been making lemon and orange flavored desserts on a constant basis.  I really enjoyed this dish!  It's just a bit fiddly because if you have just one stand mixer you have to beat the whites and then use another bowl to beat the orange batter.  I solved the problem by beating the whites and then transfering them to another bowl while I beat the rest without even washing the bowl or the beater.  I didn't really measure the zest, just zested one large lemon and two oranges (I wanted a very strong orange taste).  Then, instead of measure the lemon and orange juice, I just juiced the zested lemon and oranges, and then added enough milk to make 2 1/3 cups of liquid.  I also used soy milk and margarine because I didn't want a dairy dessert.  I served this as a hot pudding with some chocolate sauce, first drizzling the sauce in a pretty design on the plate and then adding a dollop of the sponge pudding.  Heather, this one is a real winner in our house, I can't wait to impress ALL my friends with it!\n",

Warm right out of the oven with a little butter, there is nothing better.  They baked up beautifully and I was very pleased with the outcome.  Thanks, Barbara for sharing this wonderful recipe.\n",

The raisins stayed moist and plump - I liked the unique method of pre-soaking them.

A wonderful combination of flavors. I served on lettuce leaves with iced tea. Light in calories but very filling. Thanks.\n",

Had it the next day for dinner with meatballs and it was fabulous.  It took about 5 minutes to get al dente.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who would like to try making homemade pasta.

I decided it's time to take matters into my own hands and make up a bunch at home.  The dough is very easy to make, and the directions for actually constructing the calzone are easy to follow.  We did get a little spillage, but that's my fault, we like a full calzone.  I made several variations, including my daughter's favorite, mozzarella chesse with green olives.

I used lump crab meat which was wonderful in this dish.  The pasta made it a very filling dish - we just had a salad with it.  The next day, I needed to add a little milk, because it had thickened overnight, but it was still delicious.  \n",

I did try to make a little one hoping it would do something unexpected but no joy. So I added some more milk [approx 1/3 cup] which got the consistency much more pancake like. However I then had a binding problem. So I finally ended up chucking in a couple of eggs and that worked well. I had even tried a different frypan hoping that was the problem but no luck there.\n",

One thing I especially liked about these is how thick the sauce is - everything holds together nicely and doesn't spill out the back of your bun quite as easily as most Sloppy Joe recipes.

It goes well with more hearty dishes. We served it with meatloaf and it was great! I think next time I would cut back on the cheese abit as that seemed to be the strongest flavor and I think I might cut my onions thicker as I could hardly find any after they were cooked. But all in all, it's easy, clean up is a breeze and it's a great new taste sensation for your potatoes!\n",

I used leftover chunks of ham instead of the canned ham.  Thanks for a delightful family dinner!\n",

Not hard to make either. I didn't add any extra stock or water because we like a thick, hearty soup/stew. Just added some salt and pepper but otherwise the seaoning was perfect. This is a wonderful cold weather meal and healthy too. Thanks for sharing it.\n",

      "0 Since we're a family that adores cheesy potatoes this was a good supper for us.  I made this the other night when some comfort food was needed.  This is a very good recipe, but it's only disadvantage is that there are no instructions how to make the cheese sauce.  I've been cooking for a while and can make a roux, but beginner cooks will get lost here.  Just to clarify things, to make the cheese sauce, melt the margarine (I used butter) in a sauce pan.  Add the flour all at once and stir until it is completely incorporated into the margarine.  Add the milk, and continue stirring all the time until the sauce has achived the desired thickness.  Add the cheese and continue stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce.\n",

I did add finely chopped green pepper and carrot in the last 5 minutes of cooking too. It was a colorful, delicious, addition to our meal. \n",

The bacon and parmesean are a great combination.  I used a Texas 1015 sweet onion (just now coming to our markets).  Really and truly, this made a wonderful luncheon dish.  I copied the recipe and it has now gone into my T&T Cookbook.  Thanks for sharing!\n",

These are very fragile oatmeal like cookies and are not overly sweet, but are still very tasty.

The only thing I changed was I had 2.7 lbs. of ground beef, so I used it all and I had no liquid smoke, so I used Smoky BBQ sauce (I got 12 burgers out of it).  I have to admit, they are a bit hard to handle.  Even with the extra meat, they were very wet.  I am sure the freezing helps, but my meat was already frozen and defrosted, so I could not freeze them again.  I did chill them before taking them out to the grill, but a couple still fell apart a little.  I would suggest to anyone to make these from fresh ground beef and then freeze as the recipe directs.  That said, I still think these were AWESOME.  My family could not believe they did not need any condiments!

But it turned out wonderful! I pureed the sauce with the veggies for a bit thicker sauce. The ONLY thing I would change is to cut back on the sugar. I served it with potatoes that I cooked with the roast and buttered cabbage. A great St Patty's Day meal!\n",

I used butter instead of margarine, but other than that I followed the recipe.  The fresh ginger is really what makes these cookies so amazing.  I would definitely recommend not putting in grated ginger instead of finely chopped ginger because the tiny chunks are phenomenal!  Mine cooked for about 10-11 minutes (I made 3 batches) and are so pretty!  They're crinkly and sparkly on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside!

The andouille adds nice flavor and heat to this dish.  We like it pretty spicy and doubled the cayenne.  I have to admit I cheated - didn't use the okra.  (Love fried okra only.)  The gumbo was great without it.  I added the fresh chopped parsley and chopped green onions as a topping in each bowl, rather than adding them to the pot which really added freshness and another layer of texture and flavor.  We'll make this again, for sure.\n",

      "0 I am somewhat embarassed to say that I have never in my life eaten corned beef. This is what I made for our St. Patrick's Day family get-together and boy, have I been missing out. In preparation, I sent my husband out to get the red Irish ale. You are right, that is a very key ingredient. I followed your directions to the letter and I made extra spice rub just for the carrots and potatoes. That is definitely the way to go. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. The red color was beautiful and impressive. The spice rub had a delicious sweet and spicy flavor. I served it with cabbage and soda bread. So, this is the first St. Patrick's Day that I have made actual Irish cuisine. We loved it and thanks for your most excellent recipe.\n",

The sauce is really the key - it is so tasty and decadent - and very lemony.  Perfect - just as scrumptious as I have been served in my favorite Italian restaurant.  Sometimes it is these simpler recipes that are simply the best.  Thanks!\n",

I used 2 poached chicken beasts.  (Also - there is a misprint in step 9 where it says 1/4 cup creamer, I believe she means the soy milk.)  This would be a nice dish to bring to a potluck.\n",

I really liked the unusual combination of spices and seasonings for the taco meat.  The addition of the Sweet and Sour Dressing was very unusual.  At first I tasted only the sweet (and I wasn't sure if that worked), but after a few more bites, the sour also came through.  DH thought I'd put French Dressing on the tacos.  It was pretty good and we ate them all.  For our particular tastes, though, I'll make this taco recipe again, but make a sour cream/salsa dressing instead.  Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.\n",

Now I needed the perfect recipe, and Eve has never let me down!  She didn't this time as well, and I really enjoyed every delicious green bite!  I cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces, used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, added some fresh garlic and a bit more balsamic vinegar than was called for.  I stir-fried the asparagus for about 3 minutes.  My one mistake was preparing these ahead of time.  By the time dinner rolled around, there was hardly any left, I had been picking at them all afternoon.  Thanks Evie, these deserve much more than a measly 5 stars!\n",

I substituted shrimp for the prawns since I didn't have those. Also, I think it is best to shell the prawns/shrimp completely, as the tails were a little clumsy. The peanuts at the end of the dish were a nice touch! Thanks!\n",

Also I think this will go well with an Asian type of sauce on the burger- perhaps a banana sauce or teriyaki sauce. Thanks for the recipe!\n",

Just as a comment, she has trouble pronouncing a hard r, so when we go out for fast food we don't go to Burger King, we go to Booger King).  I made these \"boogers\" last night, and she's fallen in love!  To keep this non-dairy I just doubled the mayo instead of using yogurt.  I grilled good old Humpty in a stove top grill pan.  Two meat-eating Dornettes had theirs in buns (Yogi's Tasty Buns are perfect for this), I had mine unaccompanied by superfluous bread, just smothered in sauce with a giant-sized Israeli salad on the side.  My veggie Dornette used the sauce for carrot stick dipping.  My dill-loving Dornette pronounced these better than Booger King!  Thanks for another winner, Miller!  \n",

I pureed the soup right in the pot with an immersion blender (known in our house as The Stick).  Pay close attention to Step #8, do not let the soup boil, it can burn on the bottom of your pot.  This reheats beautifully in the microwave.  I can't wait to try a version with chopped leeks and maybe a little smoked mozzarella.  \n",

I actually used the sauce ingredients on some boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and after marinading all day long cooked them in my stove-top grill pan (I just love the grill marks it makes).  I took Bergy's advice and went easy on the hoisin, firstly because I didn't want to overpower the flavor, and secondly, that stuff is pretty rare around here and I'm hoarding the bottle. I had this with some whole wheat couscous, how's that for fusion cuisine?  I actually doubled the recipe (using about 5 pounds of chicken breasts) since I was cooking for someone in the community who is ill at the moment.  I got a 5 star review from them as well, so this recipe is worth 10 stars!\n",

After sampling the finished sauce prepared according to the instructions, I decided to try adjusting the seasonings -adding a bit more sugar, etc. I even tried adding a drizzle of Asian sesame oil as a condiment.  This helped some, but I still found the taste to be overly of lime juice and it overpowered the dish for me.

The filling tastes wonderful, I used a burrito seasoning mix and really packed the chimichangas, so I only ended up with 14, instead of 16.  I shallow-fried half of them and then baked them for about 1/2 hour at 300°, the rest I wrapped in foil and froze...so I don't know how those will be when baked from frozen.\n",

Unless you are using a very low-sodium brand of bacon, I'd leave the salt out of the spice mix altogether. Also, I think the prep time needs adjusting. Maybe the more you make them the faster it gets but it took me closer to 30 minutes to assemble the shrimp. I then laid them on a baking tray, covered them in cling film, and kept them in the fridge until they were ready to go. Thanks for a tasty number!\n",

I loved the taste of the sauce - all those ingredients pack in so much great, unique flavor.  I chose to add all of the optional veggies and stirred them right in with the noodles, then waited for this to chill a bit before tasting it and like the previous reviewer, sprinkled sesame seeds on top of the finished product. The recipe makes a lot of extra sauce - I found that I only needed about 1 cup (full batch made 2 1/4 cups).\n",

I added some fish sauce on a small portion to see if that made a difference and it did change the character to be more Thai- so that was the difference. I would definitely make these again as my family likes these, and I think they are a good recipe for basic noodles. Thanks for the recipe!\n",

I used my own frozen New Mexico green chiles, and while they are quite a bit hotter than the canned chiles, I didn't have to use very much, maybe a scant Tbsp.

I felt the amount of rice was fine - the liquid reduced considerably while simmering. Mine did thicken up much more than that last reviewer's did - but it still was a loose pudding, even after chilling.  The taste was very pleasant and reminded me of English custard with rice in it. Thanks for sharing!\n",

Fresh corn is not available in March in Canada so I used a small tin of \"niblets\" and I thickened the sauce with corn starch. I found the zucchini was overcooked so another time I would leave it until the last 15 minutes. \n",

I usually roast vegetables in bulk and just keep them in the fridge to add to pasta, quiches, whatever.  I love the idea of just adding the eggs and cheese and, boom, supper!

      "0 I made this punch for DD's wedding reception this past weekend.  I made the punch on Friday, and taste tested it.  It was way too orange juicy and I was beginning to think I had made a big mistake.  By Saturday morning, the flavors had blended and it was really delicious!  I would definitely recommend that this be made at least 1 day ahead.  Since we used a fountain at the reception, I left out the orange slices and ice.  Also, even though I used low pulp orange juice, I strained the oj before adding it in.  This was strictly so the punch would flow well through the fountain.  I don't think the lack of pulp affected the flavor at alland this will be by punch recipe from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!\n",

They are great, very light brown and crisp.Didn't use any oil & just lightly salted them. My DH sliced them with the meat slicer. DH Loves chips, these are so good and so much better for him.

I used tons of extra garlic, and did the whole thing in the crock pot.  I used a much smaller roast, but still used the same quantity of the rest of the ingredients.  This was so easy.  I took some of the meat in to work the next day and nuked it up in the office.  I made everyone jealous with the heavenly smell.  I actually threw in some frozen green beans the second time around and they cooked up in the meat juices and sauce.  Definitely something I'll be making again and again.  Kol hakavod, Chia!\n",

This smells wonderful, tastes even better and has just the right combination of ingredients in the dressing. This is a recipe that makes capers, an ingredient I am not too fond of, taste good. Remember to check if the cheese is soaking in brine and be prepared to pop it in some fresh water to get rid of some of the salt. I recommend real Mediterranean cheese as I tried doing a similar recipe with some Australian halloumi and it began to melt on me. The real thing holds up to the frypan in a much more convincing way.\n",

It is light, cooks to a beautiful golden brown and easily makes two 12 inch rounds. Make sure you use fresh, real Parmesan cheese and fresh rosemary for the best taste. And I thought it got even better the next day for lunch! Worth noting: the time given to prepare and cook it is a bit misleading. If you count all the rising times you'll need at least an hour and a half from start to finish. Still, it's definitely worth the effort. Also, I only needed about 2/3 cup potato water to bring the dough together.\n",

Put the broth in a bigger pot added the vegetables and spices, cooked them till done added the peas and corn and orzo pasta. Served it with cornbread. My DH and the  grandkids loved it.

I futzed around a bit with the quantities of the fresh herbs, added more basil and less rosemary, just because I love basil and am not the greatest fan of rosemary.  I grilled these in my stove-top grill pan and it was juicy and delicious.  I think the lemon juice really added something to the flavor, next time I might just add some lemon zest as well.  These burgers are almost Greek in taste, and delicious!\n",

I made them exactly according to this recipe, using olive oil (and s&p) and cooking them 10 minutes per side for 1 1/2 inch steaks.  I also made the sauce exactly as written, and served it on the side like steak sauce.  Perfect.  No improvement possible.\n",

No one has heard of a chanterelle in this country outside of culinary school, so I used a mix of wild and champignon.  Shallots are also hard to come by, so I used half an onion.  In spite of all these substitutions, this was totally yummy!  The recipe is for 4, and the two of us only managed to eat half of it, so I had the rest this morning in an omelette, it's a fantastic filling.  With a fresh glass of juice and the morning paper, the day could not start out any better!\n",

We loved it.  Next time I will just use one clove of garlic - I used two large ones and it was a bit garlicky for our taste, but outstanding anyway.  I'll definitely make it again.\n",

They are almost little cakes with frosting (which is really sweet and really good).  The nutmeg on top is a must.  As far as the time, it took about 12 minutes for each cookie tray and I made about 6 trays, so there's an hour right there, but as I said, I liked them and will make them again.  A little red or green food coloring in the frosting and they would sure look like Christmas!\n",

I also made it a day ahead of time, which I always do for fish chowder or lobster stew.  It was really great!

In fact, the first time I couldn't roll it out because it stuck to the rolling pin and the pastry mat. I ended up patting it into the pie plate to shape.  The second time, I chilled it overnight, and used a lot of flour on the  mat, on top of the dough, and on the pin.  This did the trick - it rolled beautifully.  I discovered that the soft dough makes for a light, and delicious, flaky crust.  This is a winner.  Thanks, Barb.\n",

While I did enjoy it,I found it to be a bit too sweet, and I would reduce the amount of sweetener next time. Other tasters in the family found it too sweet and didn't care for it as much as I did.  Still,this is a good no-sugar option for those of you who do enjoy a sweet dressing, but want to cut down the sugar.\n",

My mom serves hers with an onion gravy (onions fried until golden and then added to cream or evaporated milk, butter and a bit of flour to thicken). I make these just like my mom and I usually serve these with some mennonite farmer sausage as well. In my opinion, this always tastes better the next day when the onion gravy has blended together with the keilke. Thanks for posting this. It was so good to know that someone else enjoys this too!\n",

There seems to be a step missing in the directions(why place the berries into a pot and then later remove them to a \"warm\" plate if you are not heating them at some point?) Simply pouring the cold water over the sugared berries doesn't really produce a syrup - it is essentially just sugar water that you dip the toast into. The second time I made the recipe, I added a step - heating the berries, sugar, and water for a few minutes until the water turned red. This time the recipe worked out nicely - the toast came out a lovely pink color from the brief dip in the pot syrup and there was a nice strawberry flavor. I would probably add a little cornstarch next time to produce a thicker syrup.  I am sorry - this recipe has great potential.\n",

I didn't add the sugar when making the French toast, but figured that if I'm already using butter and maple syrup, why go with skim milk, and used half and half.  This is a great breakfast for those who really want to spoil themselves!\n",

Amber Anaya made a good point in that you need to salt and pepper the steaks very well before cooking. The sauce was very lively in flavor and a great compliment to the tuna. Thanks a bunch.\n",

I don't eat pork, and veal is a little hard to get, so I used 3 pounds of ground beef.  I splurged a bit and had the butcher grind up the beef for me from a beautiful piece of meat, and I'm glad I did, because it was really worth it.  As for the laziness, I didn't parboil the cabbage.  I kept it in the freezer overnight, and the leaves peeled off easily in the morning.  I also made this in the crockpot, slicing the carrots thinly, and started it up in the morning and cooked it on low for about 10 hours.  The house smelled heavenly when I got home.  The kids wanted to know why we were eating such special food during the week, they just don't understand how special Zaar Tag can be!

I do have to admit that I am not a fan of goat's cheese, so I used a really good sheep's milk feta.  The sharpness of the cheese went beautifully with the nutty flavor of the quinoa.  Before squeezing the juice out of the lemon I zested it and also tossed the zest in with the parsley.  The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of pine nuts, but that's a joke in this family, I topped it all with about 1/2 cup of pine nuts, which we all fought over, of course.

I also added the sauce to the macaroni, and then added the cheese, 1/2 cup at a time, to the macaroni mixture.  This worked out very well.  I only used 2 cups of extra sharp cheese in the macaroni, and then covered the top with a layer of cheese and put it under the broiler for a melted/brown/bubbly cheesy top.

      "0 Mirj, thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.  I am having to change some cooking habits for DH, and this one is A-1!  I used chicken breast halves that had bones, and cooked it 6 hours.  The chicken was moist, the zucchini still looked bright, and the sauce was way too good to be healthy. LOL!  This one goes into my tried and true book, 'cause I will surely be making this again.  Thanks!\n",

Everyone loved the fact that they were so different for the ordinary. The cookies held their \"drop\" shape while they baked, so if you are planning to ice them I would recommend rolling them into balls and flattening slightly. However these cookies are super even without the added icing! Thanks for sharing this fun treat!\n",

They're easy to refrigerate, and re-heat in the microwave for a weekday breakfast to go.  I used Jimmy Dean's sage sausage, drained all the fat off after cooking, and patted with paper towels to remove any remaining fat.  I also used a 12 oz package of pre-shredded cheddar cheese, which was plenty, and I just needed 1 cup of milk.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, and they were nicely browned, but soft and tender.  We'll definitely make them again.\n",

I tried using the 1 Tbsp filling per dumpling as directed, but found the dough too thin(it kept tearing)and had to cut the filling amount down to 1 tsp per - this worked out much better & without tearing.  I ended up with over half of the raw meat mixture still unused and about 20 dumplings. The cook time was very precise -they were done in 6 minutes exactly. The dipping sauce was very strongly flavored of soy sauce - next time I would increase the oil a bit and add some sugar, and perhaps a splash of rice wine vinegar to help cut the saltiness of the soy sauce. We did enjoy this recipe, just not as much as expected.  I'm very sorry-from your description, it sounds like you have had much better luck with these and hopefully others will as well.\n",

The texture was a just little too soft -even though I chilled it longer than the 2 hours called for. It was not runny - just a bit too soft, making it hard to remove from the pan neatly.  I think perhaps a bit more cream cheese (perhaps even as much as an extra package) would solve this  minor problem.  But really, this was a delightful dessert that I'd be happy to make again.

It definately tastes more like cake than bread, but when its this good, who cares what you call it.  Thanks sooo much Michelle!!\n",

I ended up using mozzarella cheese and 4 really thin steaks (about 1/4 pound each)and tried to stuff as much in each one as possible :) and then whatever was leftover I put around the steaks after the first half hour.  I also topped it with more mozzarella the last 10 minutes of cooking, yum....cheese.  I served it with pasta andI think next time I will cut up even more mushrooms and onions and add more sauce then listed in the recipe so there's more for the pasta.  Because of the smaller steaks, I overcooked it a little, but it was still outstanding and I can only imagine how much better it will be when I get it right!

      "0 This was an easy recipe that made a great lunch for me and my husband. I added 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 t. minced garlic and sauteed in oil, then I added zucchini and seasonings. The cumin flavor was good and my husband squirted Tabasco all over his. I may add some sliced mushrooms next time. Yooper, thanks for a great recipe.\n",

      "0 Most of the time, when I serve a recipe without meat, the family really complains.  So, to please them, I sauteed some smoked sausage with the vegetables before adding the rice.  After the spices were added at the end, the white rice took on the greenish yellow color of the cumin and curry with the black beans mixed in, so at first everyone just stared at their plate and didn't know what to expect.  Well, after the first bite, there was no doubt - everyone loved it! There were no left overs.  Next time I'm going to make it my way - no meat!  I'll be sure to serve some meat on the side for the rest of the family.  Thanks for sharing this delicious and healthy recipe.\n",

You could even substitue an avocado for the tomatoes if you wanted to make this refreshing salad in the winter, when good tomatoes are scarce.  Definately a keeper.

I highly recommend using the Amaretto, sooo good!! This is spectacular enough for company and a great time saving dessert! The crunchy, cool and creamy with the fruit is a great combination. A winner all the way!\n",

Okay, this is not an advertisement for my diet.  I had a whole fillet of salmon in my freezer (about 2 pounds) which I cut up into serving portions while still slightly frozen.  I also zested the lemons and mixed that in with the cream, salt and pepper and the nutmeg.  This was truly one of my more enjoyable suppers and I discovered this morning that it heat up beautiful in a microwave, as long as you don't do it on full power.

Since I was serving this with chicken I used soy milk and melted margarine.  I served this with stove-top grilled chicken breasts, roasted potatoes and an Israeli salad.  My kids don't think I'm crazy anymore!  Thanks, Barbara, these were really good!\n",

      "0 I expected a lot of heat when preparing this dish (I used de Arbol chiles for the dried, and Thai chiles for the fresh) yet due to the quantity of food it was not as hot as I imagined. It was still a hot dish, mouth-tingling, but not something that I found to be a challenge to eat. I was going to make this with just chicken, but then I decided to go ahead and use the ribs and sausage and was glad I did, although the dish could easily be made without them. The dish seems very forgiving if you want to vary the ingredient amounts slightly (meats/veggies). I did have to cook this a bit longer than the stated time because my potatoes weren't getting done. The instructions didn't say what size chunks to cut them into, but I recommend on the smaller side if you want to stick to the posted times. However, cooking longer, although compromising the texture of the tomato, didn't affect the quality of the flavor of the dish, which was excellent. This is a dish I would make again, perhaps even with more chiles, or perhaps using habaneros as an alternative to ramping up the heat. Thanks for the recipe!\n",

I only had the type of cake mix with pudding already in it, so I tried it anyway and it worked out beautifully.   I also had no vodka, so I substituted brandy, which also worked out well.  I was worried that this might be heavily laden with a strong alcohol taste, but it was not.  You certainly can tell that there is Irish Crema in the batter, but it wasn't overpowering at all - very good balance with the chocolate. Thanks!\n",

The goat cheese cream was on the thick side and could easily be thinned with additional buttermilk.

      "0 OUTSTANDING!!  This will go straight into my permanent recipe box.  The cake itself is worthy of 5 stars on its own, but the dessert this divine tasting cake turns into once the lemon curd, raspberries, and thick gooey icing are added is spectacular.  The flavor is excellent and the instructions clear & accurate (although I added more lemon juice to my glaze as I prefer it thinner).  Note: I was unable to use an angel food cake pan this time, so after some research I found out that I could use two 9x5\" loaf pans (ungreased) instead and lowered the temp to 350F, placing them in the center of the oven - these changes were to accomodate the different size pans.  I had just a small amount of batter left over as a result.  This worked out just fine. Thanks for this 10 star recipe.\n",

I used Hot Hungarian paprika, and and I thought all of the spices worked very, very well together for a flavorful chicken.  You can use more or less of spices, according to your family tastes.  Next time I do this recipe I will experiment with Cajun spices, or barbecue spices, or lemon pepper.  The possibilities are unlimited.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.

I had put all the ingredients into the food processor without the half and half, and found that it was the perfect consistency (I like thick dressings), so I left out the 1/2 & 1/2 altogether.  I put together a very nice composed salad with the ingredients listed in the recipe, and also added a sliced hard-boiled egg.  I \"draped\" the dressing over the top and had a very classy lunch.

It was still plenty spicy, but no one breathed fire.  When serving only to adults I would certainly add the full heat, but it was excellent with less.  The fresh pineapple really complimented this well.  For the chile powder, I used dried ancho chile powder.\n",

This will be repeated often, especially in grilling season! I cannot wait to have it with grilled meats. Bring this to your next cookout and you will be hunted down for the recipe! The layers are just beautiful to look at. Thanks Mirj for a deliciously different way to serve bread!\n",

It has a great flavor and just the low fat grams alone make this fantastic. Not to mention the fact that it whips together in no time flat! I used real rum instead of the extract and loved the flavor it gave. Other flavorings will be fun to try as well. Thanks Chia for the great dessert!\n",

We were pleasantly surprised by the combination of orange with the other flavours in this dish. I did cut way back on the amount of oil though -- to about 1/8 cup -- to make it healthier. Even with the small amount of oil, we still had tons of dressing left over. I think you could halve the liquids and have just about the right amount, if you don't want a lot of juice.\n",

However, I had difficulty getting this to firm up as a pie- I suspect that the short cooking time is the culprit here-after the full 12 minutes, it was still very, very thin - it did not even coat the back of my spoon.  So, I cooked my filling an additional 5 minutes, until it just started to coat the spoon - I was tempted to cook it even longer, but I was afraid to overcook it.  It did firm up more on cooling, but never enough to slice into pie wedges, even after chilling overnight. Next time, I would continue cooking longer - until it has thickened up more.  But this was really quite tasty as a custard and I will make this again, but perhpas just make the filling and put it into a glass bowl.\n",

I used half white chocolate and half milk chocolate chips, so we had two-tone clusters.  The dried fruit was mostly craisins and apricots, with a raisin thrown in for good measure.  I also didn't use salted cashews, we're not crazy on salty chocolate, so I just used plain roasted cashews.  My BH, who is a real cashew candy maven, was almost brought to tears when he tasted this.  I guess I'm going to have to turn into a cluster factory to keep everyone happy!\n",

I found this one, marinaded my ribs the night before, got home from work and, I'm sorry, didn't believe that you could cook this cut for just 20 minutes.  I was wrong!  These came out tender, juicy and flavorful. I followed Di's instructions exactly, using fresh herbs from my garden. I'll be making this again this summer!  Thanks Di Neal!\n",

I don't/won't eat pork, so I used portions of boneless, skinless chicken breast instead.  Usually I have my chicken breasts slapped down flat, but this time I left them \"unslapped\" so there was some thickness to them.  No lime juice, so I used lemon.  I grilled the chicken outside and the smell had my neighbor practically inviting herself to dinner.  We've got tiny little pears in this country, so I used 8.  The spicy sweetness of the salsa made a great flavor combo with the marinated and grilled chicken.  Chia, your pork recipes always did well by me, as long as I turn them into chicken recipes!  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!\n",

During preparation, when sauteeing the chiles and waiting for them to soften the Guajillos are notorious for being tough and may not soften up the way you expect. However, the skins do puree in the blender well, even if still on the slightly hard side. I had waited to get them soft and my liquid was evaporating so I added more stock, but I could see the coloration of the chiles in the dish so that is a good indicator. All that aside, the chicken is excellent, and the extras also make good sandwiches on a kaiser roll if you have any left. Thanks for a great recipe, I'm sure to try this one again.\n",

I sprinkled the chicken with the pepper, salt, chili powder and garlic powder, then placed it on the grill, I let it cook on indirect heat for about 10 minutes before putting on the glaze.  I couldn't 'brush' it on the meat without wiping off the previously applied spices, you have to kind of 'dab' the glaze onto the chicken.  Also, the amounts called for the glaze would be enough for about 3 chickens and, most likely 2-3 turkey breasts.  \n",

I would add that extra 1/4 cup of milk and tha would probably make the difference. However even at less than perfect this is a superb tasting bread. Definitely worth making again.\n",

I recommend adding about 1/4 c. of confectioner's sugar to the cream cheese and strawberry juice mixture. It makes the spread just a little bit sweeter.  I cut the loaves lengthwise first and then crosswise to make my small finger sandwiches.\n",

I had \"lettuce issues\" so I ended up using green leaf, and I discovered at the last minute that I was out of red wine vinegar so I had to use cider vinegar. Probably affected the taste a bit, but not too much. I used london broil and added the optional mushrooms. I thought it was good. Hubby didn't want the lettuce and the kids wanted more \"sauce\" (ie. dressing). This isn't a keeper for us.\n",

I was confused about the amount of broth to add, though.  2 1/4 cups is listed in the ingredients, but the text only mentions 1/2 cup of it.  I used about 1 to 1 1/2 cups total to make a nice gravy, but when I opened the packets to serve, the broth was pretty runny.  I think I will use less and make the gravy thicker next time.  We still enjoyed it very much, and will definitely do this again.\n",

They were surprisingly simple to make for such a sophisticated cookie (I didn't even need my mixer, I did it all by hand). Since I'm mildly compulsive about futzing around with just about any recipe I use, I made a couple of minor changes; firstly, I had to use semisweet chips (no milk choc. chips in the house), and secondly, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the citrus layer (I like cinnamon with chocolate and love it with orange, so I though that it had to be good with both - it was!). The texture is what makes this, though; they really do \"practically melt in your mouth\". So decadent! \n",

Aside from using steaks instead of fillets, the only change I made was to use a whole red pepper and a whole orange pepper.  I served this with a green salad with some balsamic dressing and it was a perfect simple meal.  Since I'm Somersizing I left off the olives, but my BH was happy to eat mine and not let food go to waste!  This recipe sounds like it would go very well with salmon fillets as well, that might be my next version.  Good one Chia!\n",

I shredded the cabbage into large confetti-sized pieces, and just gave it a quick boil (2 minutes) before draining.  After that I just followed the directions, pouring the cabbage mixture into a shallow casserole dish lined with parchment paper.  It came out very custardy, and was delicious.  I grew up with Eastern European parents, and I'm a big fan of caraway, so this was typical comfort food for me.  I had this with some smoked mackerel on the side, and it was a yummy, Old Country supper.\n",

Since these are \"spice\" bars I elected to use the 1 1/2 tsp. apple pie spice. The bars themselves were perfectly spiced and the carrots, zucchini, etc. were present in the flavor without being overpowering. I felt the bars were a bit crumbly and cake-like to be so thin (they came out about 3/4\" thick). The frosting, too, was fine out of the bowl, quite sweet and rich, and I liked the cinnamon addition. However, it overpowered the bars rather than complementing them. I think both the textural issues and the problem with the frosting could be overcome by simply baking them in a smaller pan, to increase the thickness (and the bar-to-frosting ratio).\n",

I baked in an 8\" square dish, and it did not get very high, so I think next time I will try a smaller dish.  I used fresh blueberries and they worked well.  Thanks!\n",

I was very pleased with the final flavor of the sauce, which was much more subtle than I expected and deliciously different. I was startled by the texture of the chickpeas - I expected them to be soft, but they were still quite firm. (I discovered that my husband doesn't like them at all.) I got complaints about the parsley, because it didn't \"blend well\" with the other flavors. I'll be leaving this in my cookbook, but will prepare it without the chickpeas and parsley next time. I highly recommend using whole wheat pasta.\n",

It's a marinade I liked a lot, with an Asian flavour, and I think you could use it on other meats, or possibly in a noodle salad. The flavours in the sauce also worked very well together. It is quite intense, with the coriander and fish stock flavours standing out, but it complimented the fish, which was more delicately flavoured. The problem I had was I did not know how long to boil the first stage of the sauce. I boiled it for over ten minutes but it never got really syrupy. In the end, I had about 1/8 cup stock and went from there. Talking since to MeanChef, this may have been a bit too much liquid, which is probably why I felt the need to add a tiny bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.\n",

I used the lettuce and sprinkled a small amount of shredded cheddar cheese on top before rolling up. We were starving and these babies did the trick.

I also didn't have any celery salt, so I used cumin instead (which was fine because there was already plenty of salt in the mix). I was pretty impressed, since I normally don't like meats that aren't marinaded, but this gave really good flavor. Next time I might add a bit of chipotle chili powder to it for some heat to complement the sugar and nutmeg.\n",

      "0 Kari, I’m so glad you dared me to make this recipe!  Not only was it very easy to make, but the taste was fantastic.  I loved the subtle lemon taste…it was a perfect accompaniment to the sweet potatoes.  I also liked the fact that all the ingredients (except the sweet potatoes) were ones that I always have in my pantry...no searching for hard to find ingredients.  My son loves sweet potatoes and has asked me to cook this recipe again next weekend.  What I really couldn’t believe though was my 3 year old eating two helpings (this is a child that eats as little real food as possible)!  I served this with baked ham, blackeyed peas and cornbread.  For dessert, we had blackberry pie with vanilla ice cream.  It was a truly delicious Southern meal! \n",

Absolutely delicious as a generous topping over a scoop (or two) of vanilla ice cream.  One note of caution - be sure to put it in a container that is deep enough.  I used a shallow baking pan, and it boiled over a bit.  Thanks love4culinary!\n",

I left out the chili peppers to make this kid friendly, but added lots of Hungarian paprika, which gave it a great color.  I'd like to try this again, but instead of fresh scallions would love to try it with fried onions.\n",

I loved the fact that there was no one overwhelming flavor...every ingredient blended together to make a fantastic salad.  I didn't add the walnuts simply because I forgot to toast them.  I did however add a small amount of hot sauce and really enjoyed the little kick it gave the salad.  I'll definitely be making this salad again very soon and I want to be sure to add the walnuts the next time.  BethT, I'm so glad I took your dare to make this recipe!

I made this pretty much as peppermintkitty wrote it, except that I substituted one can of Rotel Original diced tomatoes and green chiles for the can of diced tomatoes and can of diced green chiles.  Also, I used a bulk taco seasoning that I buy at a store nearby, which worked out well.  For the milk, I used skim.\n",

The recipe does not state how large the can of diced tomatoes should be, and I used my regular size, which turned out a bit too much and made the loaf a little too \"mushy\", so I had to up the breadcrumbs to get it to the right consistency so I would get a good slice out of it.  The recipe also doesn't call for any salt, and I found that the Worcestershire sauce did not give it enough of a salty flavor, so we found ourselves salting the loaf at the table.  Aside from that, this was a superb recipe, and I look forward to making it again!\n",

      "0 This was a good, hearty casserole. We enjoyed all the different veggies in this and it was also quite easy to prepare and was very economical. My family loves cheesey macaroni casseroles and all of the ingredients appealed to us. Unfortunately, I really didn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce as much as I'd expected. The taste of the Dijon mustard was a bit overpowering - I think next time I would reduce the amount to just a few Tablespoonfuls, rather than the whole 1/2 cup called for. Also, the cook time indicates only 25 minutes, but this is only taking into account the baking of the casserole. Browning the meat, cooking the pasta,and cooking the sauce took an additional 25-30 minutes. UPDATE: The recipe has been edited to correct the amount of mustard since this review was first written.\n",

Each batch was superb.  I brought all three batches decoratively laid out on a nice plate as a gift to my hosts for Saturday lunch, and you could just tell by the looks on their faces that I'm invited back again and again.

      "0 One of the best casual supper dishes I have had in a long time.  I nuked the carrots and asparagus in the microwave.  The only other change I made was to use a teflon roasting dish to cook the potatoes and then the frittata.  Okay, cast-iron would have been better, but mine wasn't appropriate for this recipe.  After inverting the frittata I slipped it back into the oven for a few more minutes to brown the underside.  With an Israeli salad on the side, lots of olive oil and lemon juice, this was a very very nice supper!\n",

To me it was a little thick for a dressing (or maybe I did something wrong), but that doesn't have anything to do with the flavor.  Just a personal preference.  I just love munching on raw veggies and a good dip makes them even better.\n",

It had a nice coffeecake-type texture once baked, and tasted equally good warm and cold. I was sort of expecting the cake to be a bit sweeter than it was (judging by the topping ingredients), but it had a nice tartness to it. This would be a nice addition to a brunch menu, I think.\n",

Maybe next time I will just use 2 eggs if they are very large.  I was in a bit of a hurry, so I didn't take time to roll them into walnut size portions, I just dropped them by teaspoons and sprinkled with sugar.  It seem to work fine.

Don't let the fact that there is both white and black pepper in the recipe confuse you, it's definitely needed and each one has it's own unique taste.  I served this with some harissa on the side (spicy Moroccan salsa), and I had a great supper.  I took one of the chicken breasts into work the next day, and it was also delicious.

My picky family was put off by the appearance (grayish brown) and texture (soft) of baked bananas and wouldn't eat them, although they liked the sauce.

      "0 This cake really didn't do it for me.  First, there is a tremendous amount of ricotta cheese in a recipe that doesn't really make a cheesecake.  I also don't know why the recipe calls for marble cake mix.  I didn't know what to do with the cocoa packet.  I tossed it in with the rest of the cake mix.  I think that was a mistake.  Between the chocolate in the cake mix, the carrots, the butterscotch chips and the almond extract, there were too many conflicting flavors in the cake, and they did not go well together.  Also, with the sugar that's already in the cake mix, the sugar in the butterscotch chips and an additional cup of sugar, that's A LOT of sugar.  Then there's almost 5 cups of sugar in the frosting.  I just found the cake too sweet for us.  At 350 degrees for well over an hour (it took about 1 1/2 hours till the skewer came out clean), the high temp caused the ricotta in the cake to crack the top, like a cheesecake, but the frosting could cover that up.  If using the full two cups of ricotta I should have baked the cake at a lower temp for longer.  I would definitely try it again, but leave out the carrots and cut back to maybe one cup of ricotta cheese.  I would also cut back on the sugar, and probably just dust the cake with some powdered sugar instead of frosting it.  This cake has a lot of potential.\n",

The Americans gobbled this up but the Brits politely picked at their plates.  Being American, I had my share and more, but next time I would use more onion and some red pepper flakes for just a bit more flavor.\n",

Once together, I divided the dough in half, patted each half into an 8\" or 9\" round and cut each round into 6 pieces; triangles.  Scones raised nicely in the oven.

I cheated while making the crust, didn't use clarified butter at all, just tossed the almonds, cookies and softened butter into the food processor and gave it a whirl until totally combined, then pressed the crust into the pan. With two pounds of cream cheese and more than half a pound of white chocolate, this is a big cake. I actually only had two packages of cream cheese in the house so substituted 2 packages of a soft 9% fat white cheese instead. I normally use this white cheese to make my cheesecakes, and the cake came out great, creamy and wonderful tasting. I didn't have any berries (wrong season in this country), so I sprinkled some Skor bits on top instead. It was a big hit with my guests, not to mention my family!\n",

The funny thing is that when I made the recipe again using the correct measurements, my husband prefered the stronger ginger flavour!! I used sherry wine and chili sauce. This was a great recipe and I look forward to making it again soon.

      "0 Great dish!  This is one of those recipes that you just keep wanting another bite.  We are on a low carb diet, so I omitted the crusts.  I layered the meat, some cream cheese, cabbage and mushrooms, and more cheese in a casserole dish.  The flavors were terrific together.  The cabbage was a lovely color which was very eye appealing.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Denise.  It will definately be on my table again.  \n",

I had a bit of trouble getting the meat to stick together when I was frying the pork balls, but it turned out ok. I think next time I may bake the meatballs ahead of time in the oven and freeze them already baked, I think that  would make it a great \"make  ahead\" meal. The sauce was very good and the vegetables were a perfect blend of flavours.\n",

I fried them as directed and then placed the cooled wontons on a cookie sheet and froze them individually before packing them in ziploc bags. Tonight, I took out one bag and popped them into my toaster oven and they were defrosted in no time. I served them with plum sauce and they were a hit.

Tamarind paste isn't available locally, but we do have a tamarind product that is more liquidy, so I just boiled it down and reduced it to get a \"paste\".  Ancho chili powder was a no-show, so I substituted some super mouth searing Moroccan chilies, dried and ground finely in my spice mill.  Anyway, once I had the whole sauce prepared, the fun really began.  I had made a double batch, used half as a marinade for two whole chickens cut into serving pieces.  I let those marinade in the fridge overnight.  Then I put them over the coals, and mopped them constantly with the 2nd half of the batch.  This sauce gave the chicken almost \"God-like\" proportions.  A friend who was recovering from minor surgery leapt out of her bed and danced for joy.  Depressed guests broke into line-dancing on my lawn.  Brits used to boiled meat and soggy potatoes raised their eyebrows and then licked their lips.  Most impressive event of the evening pertaining to this chicken -- Dornette #1 asked for seconds!  Miller, we should take this on the road, your sauce, my chicken, we could set up a tent and rake in several billion dollars.  Or maybe not.  Still, it's gooooooood stuff.  One Scottish friend declared it perfect with some Glen-something-or-other.  I didn't get the name, his mounth was too full of chicken and he had had enough Glenwhatever to make his Scottish brogue even broguy-er.  To make a short story long, make this sauce, you'll thank me first, then you can thank Miller.  \n",

I learned that for this bread, as the recipe says, two rises are not necessary. I also learned that I'm pretty set in my ways. Next time (and there will be more times), I'll mix up the yeast and liquids as stated, add about 1 cup flour, the sugar and salt and beat it by hand. I will then add the other ingredients and the rest of the flour. Then I won't have any beaters or another mixing bowl to wash. That said, the recipe is very good, and I want to thank s'kat for posting it. For what its worth, I needed 1 tablespoon more than 4 1/2 cups flour. The dough was pretty sticky, from the cheese, I think, but I could shape it. I got 16 one and a half ounce rolls and one 8 1/4 oz mini-loaf. BTW, I didn't have garlic salt, so I nuked 1/4 teaspoon grated garlic in the butter and increased the salt by 1/8 teaspoon.   \n",

The batter was rather thick. It was interesting doing all the calculations, and we have a cake that we are eating, but I really wonder if it is at all similar to the one posted.

The marinade is so delicious that I couldn't bear to discard it, so I brought it to boil for one minute and basted the steaks while they cooked.  I also basted chicken breasts with the marinade for my daughters who refuse to eat beef.  My daughters LOVED their chicken and asked me to cook it this way from now on!  I served this dish with steamed jasmine rice and flash-cooked greens with garlic.  We used the boiled marinade as a sauce over the rice.  We had an excellent meal tonight!

Instead of Cool Whip I made up my own whipped cream and flavored it with a bit of rum extract, to go with the eggnog theme.

Even so, the yield was about 3/4 cup. It gives a whole new meaning to the word spicy. In order to taste it, I mixed about 1 teaspoonful in 2 cups of plain yogurt, and it's still very hot. But that's not the main reason I'm not happy with this. The flavor has no complexity. The only thing I can taste in it is the chilies. The other ingredients are completely overpowered by them. I will freeze the rest and use it when I need a chili puree.\n",

You didn't say in the directions to drain the liquid from the crockpot before adding the shredded chicken, so I didn't and added cornstarch to thicken it.  I served the chicken and thickened sauce on buns.  When I first began eating the sandwich, I thought it was really good...however, after eating about half of the sandwich, it began to not taste quite so good.  I've never had this happen to me before and can't explain it.  Thinking it might be better today, I brought leftovers with me for lunch.  The same thing happened...the first few bites were really good, then it wasn't.  I want to try this again and see if I have better results with the recipe.  If so, I'll be happy to revise my review.      \n",

I was a bit worried that the filling would spill, so I sprinkled them with cornstarch and then dipped them in batter and fried them. Nothing spilled. Also, because of the size of the chilies, I chopped up the vegetables very fine (peeling, chopping and draining the tomato separately), before mixing them with the cheese and crab. The asparagus was thin, so it didn’t need blanching. Thank you for the recipe.\n"

So I tweaked it to fit our tastes.  I added a package of pepperoni, chopped canadian bacon, mushrooms, chopped onion, garlic and just a dash of salt.  Since I added all these, I used 2 cans of pizza sauce.  I also used a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  I omitted the biscuit mix crust (which I don't care for...just a personal preference) and served this with bread sticks and salad.  This turned out to be a very yummy dish that the whole family really enjoyed.  \n",

      "0 These were great!  We had them this morning with eggs and it was so much easier than having all the frying pans going at once.  I used about 2 lbs. of baking potatoes and left the skins on and used one pound of bacon.  I laid sliced onion on top of the potatoes and sprinkled with salt and pepper before laying on the bacon.  The potatoes didn't get overly crisp, but were still awesome.  The bacon needed to be a little crispier, so I just nuked it for a minute.  Thanks for the simple, time saving recipe!\n",

I also substituted herbes de Provence for the basil, which I was surprised to have run out of.  Some of this will go to work today, for a collegue, some will get frozen, most will get eaten soon.

The only fat came from the cookie dough, which made it great for the whole family.  It was still thick and creamy and soooo tasty.  This truly is an awesome recipe and the kids were thrilled (me too)!  Thanks for sharing!\n",

      "0 I haven't tasted these yet, but they smell great and I'm sure they *taste* great, but they just didn't seem to rise to the occasion.  They look rather flat rather than having the characteristic dome-tops of muffins and are a little dense, it seems.  I don't know enough about kitchen chemistry, but I am looking at my Baker's Dozen cookbook and it recommends 1tsp baking powder for every cup of flour (unless there are heavy ingredients like chocolate chips, raisins, fruit etc. (and I would consider the raspberries to be in this catagory) wherein it suggests you use 1.5tsp for every cup of flour.)  Also, it reccommends that you use 1/4tsp baking soda per cup of flour or up to 1/2tsp per cup of flour if you have the afore mentioned heavy ingredients.  That was really the only problem, and as I said before I'm sure they taste wonderful- they're just looking a little more like cookies than muffins, almost.  I used almond extract, not hazelnut but I figured that the extract amounts being Tablespoons was a typo because 2TBS total of extracts seems like a WHOLE LOT.  I also used frozen, partially thawed raspberries rather than fresh.\n",

I used super fresh veggies from my garden for those 3 ingredients and found this to be bursting with flavor.  Bergy, one thing that confused me was that in step #4 I combined the mozzarella and parmesan, but then in step #7 you say to sprinkle on the parmesan cheese and finish baking.  I caught that discrepancy before I began making this and so I divided the parmesan and put half with the mozzarella and half on top after baking 20 minutes.  That stragedy worked and so I still give this 5 stars for a recipe that was so totally delicious.  Thanks Bergy!\n",

I guess this is called goulash because you kind of add whatever you have in the fridge and that worked for me!  I had leftover pepperoni (sliced) and had sauce and cooked sausage (3 pieces) in the freezer, so all I had to do was defrost and slice after boiling the pasta.  I wasn't sure how much mozzarella cheese to use, so I used a TOTAL of 16 ounces.  This worked great and was cheesy enough for us.  Thanks a lot for sharing!  P.S.  The only thing I changed was I used less garlic...only because there was already a lot in my sauce and I did not use the optional ingredients.\n",

In step #3 it says 'blend (ingredients) and remaining milk in medium bowl'....what is the remaining milk?  I ended up not putting in the milk in step #1, I didn't see the need for it.  In step #3, I added 2 T. of milk to blend with the powder and topping.  This seemed to work OK and the pie was fine.  Just confusing directions.  I'll jack up the star rating when the discrepancy is cleared up.  Thanks for the recipe, it was fun, like a frozen chocolate malt with some crunch!\n",

I know you said no substitutions, but to make it a *little* healthier, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and fat free half and half in place of the regular half and half!  It was out of this world...rich and creamy!  One suggestion...the peanut butter, cocoa, vanilla and sugar mixture was just about impossible to mix by hand...it turned out like a lump of play dough.  Even more impossible was trying to combine that with the half and half.  I pulled out the blender, dumped it all in and that problem disapeared!  I can't describe how great this was...the whole family loved it and I will make it again and again!  My husband said it was better than any ice cream we ever bought in a store.

      "0 Oh, this stuff is great!  I found it quite filling and VERY tasty.  And easy once you get all that chopping of all of those potatoes done!  It makes you feel all lovely and warm inside.  I imagine it really would be great for a cold.  Anyhow, I added cumin and a little chili powder in leu of the paprika as we don't really keep paprika in the house as its mostly flavorless if you ask us.  I put the rice in after 15 minutes cooking time, but after another 15 minutes it was most definitely not done so I simmered for another 10-15 until it was done.  I used brown rice, so this may have had an effect on that, perhaps.  Anyway, I loved it, though my boyfriend said he felt a little \"cilantroed-out\" afterwards.  He would have liked to see an addition of some meat- he says fish, but I say chicken.  We'll see next time I make it what I do.  I served it with garlic bread (made from a baguette that I bought to eat with this soup but my BF insisted I make garlic bread out of it) and we sprinkled the cilantro and pepper on top as suggested.  I froze the leftovers (it's only me and my boyfriend, so we couldn't eat the whole batch) in a gallon bag, but I wish I hadn't because I want some more right now!!! Thanks for a great recipe.\n",

The butter didn't mix with the sugar completely, and consequently some plain butter ran down onto the crackers and under the foil. It doesn't seem to have affected the texture, and might have made them easier to remove from the pan. Next time I will try to fill the pan with crackers (I got hung up on the number 40, and ended up not filling the pan. Whoops). I \"mooshed\" the nuts into the chocolate to make sure they would stick. I also put the pan in the fridge, without breaking the cracker apart first. In order to remove them, I just lifted the foil out of the pan and bent it and peeled the crackers off - making each cracker one piece of toffee/ candy/ cookie/ whatever. I also have to note that I used hazelnuts (thought I had pecans in the freezer, but I was wrong).\n",

I shaved the ginger with a potato peeler, which gave it more surface and more flavor.  Instead of lemon flavoring I used shaved pieces of lemon peel and strained that out with the ginger.  I only had liquid stevia around, and used just a few drops.  This makes a great syrup to use with club soda, but it also makes a great syrup to add to a chicken stir-fry.  Add just about a tablespoon to your stir-fry with lots of scallions and some lemon-grass, and you have a winner!\n",

I also seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before browning. I used two 4-oz. jars sliced mushroons because we like lots of mushrooms. We liked the flavor of the gravy but we especially like dijon mustard. It was ready after cooking for 6 hours on LOW. The chops were tender and juicy and the veggies were tender, too.

DH needs to cut down on the sugar and I think the corn syrup will make it sweet enough for us.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing.\n",

      "0 I don't have a bread machine, so I made this bread using instructions from Donna M. in Talk (thanks a bunch Donna!!).  I mixed the wet ingredients together, then the dry ingredients in another bowl.  After the yeast \"proofed\", I added the wet ingredients to the dry.  I kneaded the dough until it was smooth and let it rise in a lightly oiled bowl.  After the dough had risen, I punched it down and let it rise again in a loaf pan.  Then I baked it for approx. 30 min at 350 degrees.  The bread had a nice taste, but wasn't very spicy (for my taste).  I think next time I make this, I'll double the cajun seasoning.  I served this bread with Chili-Cheese Steaks, Grilled Herbed Potatoes and Okra Salad.  It was an overall very good meal.  \n",

First, you should know that I did not use mushrooms but I did add in some chilli peppers and I used penne pasta instead of spiral. I also left the cheese off the top. But I made the sauce exactly as directed and it was wonderful! The thyme is a great addition I wouldn't have thought of and I particularly liked the parmesan cheese in the sauce, not just on top as in other dishes. Also, there was plenty of sauce to cover the pasta. Sometimes dishes like this can be quite dry, but that wasn't the case here. Thanks for a great recipe that's easy to adjust to what you like and what's on hand.\n",

I am not into rolling pastry, so I just made a cookie-crumb crust, left out the sugar but added the mini chips when I whizzed the cookies in the food processor.  I used about 250 grams of milk chocolate, and instead of Cool Whil just whipped up 1/2 cup of heavy cream with a tablespoon of sugar to get the basic equivalent.  I had a quarter of the pie left over after dinner and stuck it in the freezer.  In a moment of weakness I started attacking it with a spoon one afternoon, this stuff is also amazing frozen.

I'm not scoring, however, because I used 2 tablespoons regular, not low-sodium soy sauce, and this may have changed the flavor. I thought there was way too much soy sauce in it. Aside from that, I would have liked to have more snow peas and less onion. I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes as stated, but then thought they were too big.

      "0 This was super great chili!  I have my own tried and true recipe, but I figured I would try this since I needed to use the crock-pot.  Well, my family flipped over it and my husband said I outdid myself! (I explained that I couldn't take the credit!)  I used small white beans and light kidney beans for the puree.  I didn't put them in the blender, instead I put them in the crock-pot first and mushed them up with a potato masher.  I love this part of the recipe, because my family is getting more fiber and they don't have a clue!  I have never used cumin or coriander and was worried they might be too strong but the chili tasted like...well...Chili!  Thanks so much for sharing!  P.S.  I used 2 lbs. of ground beef...otherwise, didn't change a thing.  NOTE: The spice mix makes enough for at least two batches of chili.\n",

So I added enough flour (5 1/2 more cups), extra salt (1 teaspoon) and some oil (1 tablespoon - just because) to make a kneadable dough. I continued from there, and got 2 medium loaves (620 g each) and 17 rolls at about 45 g (1 1/2 oz) each. What can I say? The bread is delicious, but it's not really the bread of this recipe. And I'm not sure what the buckwheat flour contributes - maybe some texture, not much flavor what with the caraway seeds.

It was cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hours, which I think was a bit too long, because the meats got a little too soft, but it could not be avoided...no one was home to turn it off!  I think if we let it go for 3 hours or so, it would have been perfect.  The sauerkraut was absolutely delicious and the caraway was not overpowering at all, which was what I expected.  I think the apples disapeared during cooking, but the potatoes were very good also.  We had this with potato and cheese pierogies.  Thanks for sharing this delicious dish!\n",

I was a bit worried during baking though, because the juice from the strawberries nearly ran over the pan and it was difficult to tell if the cake was cooked underneath. I baked it for about 40 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks for a keeper!\n",

Usually muffin batter is much more like cake batter than cookie dough.  Had I known I might have made these in my KitchenAide rather than by hand, because my arms were darn tired after mixing all the flour in- and THEN I had to mix in the peaches.  I didn't use quite-ripe peches, and I'm sure they would have been much better had I used fully ripe peaches and yellow peaches rather than white (there were no yellow at the grocery).  Overall good, but needs a few touches and a warning about the thickness of the batter.  Pretty muffins, though.\n",

      "0 Wonderful! I must admit when I first read the recipe I was a little worried that the salmon wouldn't have a lot of flavor since it wasn't marinated or anything. Yet, the dressing holds so much flavor that it really complements the salad nicely. The heat in this was mildly hot since the chilies were spread out over such a large area, so if you like things spicy, plan on having a few more peppers on hand. Yet it was spicy enough to still be enjoyable. Overall, this was a refreshing salad that is great for summer and reminding one of summer when the days of summer are long gone. I think if you had a chance, grilling the salmon for the salad might be a great idea, too. I'll be making this often! Thanks for posting, Chia!\n",

I did a little substituting and used sweet turkey sausage (it was on sale), baked with a little bacon grease and pepper and 6 crumbled strips of bacon rather than a can of bacon bits (NOTE- if you are to use bacon bits, you must use Oscar Myers or similar bacon bits that are actually made of REAL BACON.), 4 cups of turkey broth made from Better than Boullion (also on sale) and half-and-half instead of cream.  I also added a little thyme to the mix.  My boyfriend loved it!  And, I, am off to have a bowl of leftovers for lunch right now.  Thanks so much!\n",

Instead of onion powder we used finely chopped onion which added a bit of fresh flavor along with the fresh parsley we used instead of parsley flakes. Also, since it was rainy, we pan-fried rather than grilled. They were wonderful! I would have maybe added even a bit more feta if I had more, but then again I'm a real cheese fan. We ate them on whole-wheat buns brushed with olive oil and toasted in the oven. They go very well with dijon mustard I found and are quite easy. mmmm....\n",

I made a double batch, rolled them out onto flour-dusted waxed paper, rolled, cut, unrolled and let them dry for about 5-6 hours.  I cooked them in about 2-3 cups of homemade chicken stock, then thickened the mixture with a flour/water mixture (that's how Grandma did it).  They were delicious.  Thanks so much Cindy Lynn for giving me a glimpse of my Grandma again!\n",

      "0 This cake worked out fine, but I had to make quite a few adjustments. First, when I was part way through the recipe, I noticed milk mentioned in the steps but not the ingredients. I had to improvise so I added just enough milk to make what I thought looked like a good thickness of batter, about 2 tablespoons. Then I realised the amount of batter was not nearly enough to fill a 9-10 inch pan (maybe a result of not knowing how much milk to use), so I used an 8 inch pan. I only ended up using about half the pears, and that did two layers over the cake. Finally, the melted butter mixture proved to be way too much for the cake. I only got about half of it on, before it overflowed the pan. I poured a bit off and baked for another twenty minutes, which worked fine. As I said, the end result was actually a pleasing cake but I think that was more down to a bit of luck and baking experience (so I could improvise) than the directions here. This recipe really needs to be clarified.\n",

      "0 Now, in its own right, this is very tasty stuff.  However, I had expected something that tasted basically like sesame chicken from a Chinese restaurant.  This has much more soy sauce flavor and is not very sweet.  I followed the recipe just about exactly, perhaps baking my chicken a little longer.  The sauce never thickened in the oven, so I poured it off the chicken and into a saucepan.  I reduced it and made it thicker with some flour and that turned out fairly well.  Did not garnish with the remaining 2 green peppers- I don't think it needed it. I served this with Sue L's Chinese Fried Rice (#38748) and, actually, substituted some of the marinated meat from this recipe that I sauteed in a pan for the meat in that recipe, which was quite good.  As I said before, this is a tasty dish in its own right, it's just not \"Better Than Take-Out.\"\n",

This time, I used 1 tsp. chipotle chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, some Adobo seasoning, 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 small chopped tomato, 1/2 tsp. each of Mexican oregano and basil, and a pinch of coarse salt (in addition to the seasoning called for in the recipe)when cooking the chicken. I also cooked off all of the water with the chicken to make the seasonings more concentrated. For veggies, I threw in some canned corn, frozen peas, carrots, and frozen turnip chunks (wanted potatoes but didn't have any, turnip kinda gave a similar effect). No disappointment this time, the extra seasoning in the chicken did the trick. I actually went a little overboard with the filling mixture and had some left over - made a nice chicken/veggie/rice bowl the next day for lunch. The fifth star was definitely warranted this time around, and I'll be making this again - thanks for the seasoning suggestions, too!\n",

At first I didn't see the 2 tablespoons water to dissolve the yeast in. To make absolutely sure people do see it, listing the water with the other ingredients might be kinder. This makes a fairly firm, plain loaf of bread, that I'm sure will be nice toasted. It was interesting to try an older recipe, though I think I will return to a more modern style of bread-making.

I panfried them and didn't lose the filling. And everyone thought they were really \"cool.\" I might experiment with a spice mixture so I can ditch the sugary soup mix, but other than that, these are perfect! Oh, and I forgot to buy green onions, but I'll definitely add them next time.\n",

The egg mixture thickened up beautifully, like a nice sweet/sour bacon gravy.  I used red potatoes, and boiled them in the skin, then sliced thin and layered in a 13X9 pan.  I poured the \"gravy\" over the potatoes and stirred, then baked for 30 minutes in a very low oven.  Perfect! Thanks for posting Lali.\n",

      "0 I was, honestly, not crazy about this.  I selected it because it got great reviews and I had the ingredients readily on hand and a pork tenderloin that needed to be cooked.  I found the sauce to have kind of a funny flavor, not very pleasing.  The pork was wonderfully tender and this is an excellent cooking method, but I was just not nuts about the flavor of the sauce.  It wasn't bad mind you, just not as good as I expected.  If I were to make this again, I think I would use a little less butter and perhaps add some chopped green onions, garlic, and other spices to the sauce, as many of the other reviewers have done.  I cooked this in a Corningware dish, rather than a skillet and perhaps that also had an effect on the flavor.  I think, also, that a bit of cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce a little more is a good idea.  \n",

I made a few minor changes- used only 1.5 lbs of catfish (which is plenty), used 4 cups of beef broth made from boullion, used about 3/4 of a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, added about 1/2 cup of corn (when the tomatoes are added), used chili powder rather than cayenne, and added a little basil because I didn't have a bay leaf (don't know why I decided to sub that, but whatever).  I also simmered it uncovered because I wanted it to reduce (as 4 cups of beef broth is more than 2 cans.) Yum yum yum yum yum!!!  My BF has told me at least 4 times now to review this and tell you how much we like it, so I am.  It's great.  I HIGHLY recommend this- great flavor, super easy, and filling.

So, anyway, I tried it. I could smell the chocolate in the dough, and was thinking of how I would ever rate this. My daughter and husband had some when it was fresh-baked. \"It's good, but what makes it that color?\" asked my daughter. She couldn't guess. It is good. It really doesn't taste chocolatey. The texture is very nice and the chocolate adds a mysterious bitterness that is just right. So maybe it's not traditional. Afterall, it is 2003. Thank you, Laudee. I need to make another batch.\n",

Blueberries are super rare and expensive in Israel, and this drink was worth using some that I have hoarded in my freezer.  If I'm already using whipped cream, I just threw caution to the winds and used full fat milk.  This was a real treat for breakfast!\n",

They had all gone to the bottom where the butterfinger particles all carmelized and made cutting the cake quite difiicult. Looked awful and difficult to sevre but good flavor.\n",

I used a 4 lb. bottom round roast and 3 tsp. of instant beef bouillon powder.  I also used regular salt because I had no seasoning salt.  Otherwise, followed to a \"T\".  I have to admit, I was worried about all that pepper, but it was fine!  I cooked 4.5 hours on high, then sliced the beef and put it back in the crockpot for about 20 minutes.  Never have I eaten a more tender roast beef sandwich.  I used split Kaiser rolls with a slice of American cheese on each and put them in the oven for about 10 minutes on 375*.  Then I piled on the sliced meat and served with the au jus.  Just wonderful.  This made 8 good size sandwiches and I still have plenty for leftovers.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! P.S. My daughter loved it so much that after her sandwich, she asked for a cup of the au jus to DRINK!\n",

Everyone at work really liked it, even the skeptics who wrinkled their noses at the description of the dessert. I didn't have coffee already made, so I dissolved a 1/2 tsp. of instant in 2 tbs. of hot water. Worked for me! I had to add extra powdered sugar to thicken the frosting enough, but it tasted great! Really nice with the pumpkin-y flavor of the cake.\n",

      "0 My original review may not have been clear enough. I would like to say that I followed this recipe strictly as to method and ingredients, including the use of a blender that would meet the standards of an American kitchen, until I found that it was not acceptable. At that point, I strained the mixture, which added about 20 minutes on to the time, and did improve the appearance and texture. I also added 1 tablespoon superfine sugar, but the resulting product was still quite tart. My original review began with, \"I strained\", and ended with \"tart\". This was my experience. It may have been that the apricots were not fresh enough to blend smoothly and/or were particularly sour. I don't know. I like apricots and was disappointed. I have only friendly feelings toward the poster of this recipe, and I believe that she posted the recipe because she enjoyed it and wanted to share. I am writing this review so that other people will know what might happen - not will happen - but might happen. I hope this is clear. (I originally gave 3 stars and am not changing that.)\n",

The cookies did spread in the first baking rather more than I expected, but the flavor more than makes up for that. I would never have guessed that you could get this favor from coffee and anise. Thank you, Wendy, for wonderful cookies.\n",

It has a more subtle chili flavor than regular chili that went great with the nacho chips.  I topped it with the jack cheese and then had to try a second helping to see if maybe cheddar was better.  Results were that both were great!  It was also incredibly easy to make.  This is going to make my lunch at work very tasty tomorrow!!  Thanks Kimke or should I thank the husband?!!!\n",

I really could not figure out how I was supposed to be doing this and my broth did not turn out clear, perhaps due to this.  I just about halved the recipe and ended up with exactly a quart.  I'm sure if I had figured out how to make this clear and pretty I would have been happier, but I just don't know what happened.

I used a 19.8 oz. dark chocolate brownie mix to balance the sweetness of the candy.  There did seem to be an awful lot of toppings so I think next time I will use a 9 x 13 inch pan so the topping is not so thick.  I cut these into smaller pieces since they are so rich.  FYI, I needed 6 fun-size snickers to get 3/4 of a cup and about a half a 14 oz. bag of M & M's.  Also, I think in the future I will try melted milk chocolate chips instead of Dove Promises which would be more economical.  This is a great recipe for any occasion, not just Halloween.

I left this recipe for my husband to make while I was at work and it was apparently easy enough for him to handle, because it was done when I got home and the house smelled great.  We had it with Rice Pilaf and string beans.  All 4 kids scarfed this down and asked if there was more!  The only complaint was that it didn't make enough.  I was surprised that the sauce stayed as thin as it did, but the flavor was awesome and was great over the rice.  Thanks for sharing this!  I normally don't even like pork, but with this recipe, our whole family can enjoy it together.  Thanks for sharing this...we all decided that this will be a regular around here!\n",

With the addition of about 6 more cups of flour and 4 or 5 tablespoons butter, and leaving all other ingredients and amounts as listed, this makes delicious bread. I liked the pine nuts and thought using caraway with cinnamon was interesting. I will certainly make this again, with the changes noted. I wish I could give it more stars.\n",

      "0 Wow! I am a canning virgin no longer!! I cannot believe that this was a success. I halved the recipe because I didn't want to sacrifice all of my husband's peppers in case of an utter failure. I used 8 habenaro peppers with the seeds (yikes) and 1 orange pepper and one yellow. I realize that this was not acurate in halving the recipe but it did work out just fine. I didn't have to use any coloring as the color was a brilliant orange just as it was. I got 7 of those tiny little cute canning jars full and I look forward to giving some out as gifts. We have already sampled one jar and the taste, texture, and smell makes me think that I couldn't have possibly made this myself! Personally, I found it a little too hot even with the cream cheese to soften to heat, however since I made this with my husband's tastes in mind it was sure a treat for him. Thanks for the canning lesson, Rita!\n",

How nice to have a tuna salad mixture that does not include mayonnaise.  I have leftovers of the tuna salad and I think it will taste great over greens (for my lunch on Monday).  Again, thanks Sugarpea for a wonderful recipe that I will be making for the rest of my life!\n",

I wasn't sure if the sauce was supposed to be regular tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce, so I used some of each.  I also used a total of 4 cups as 6 cups seemed like too much, and this worked out fine.  I was surprised at the layering...usually I do sauce, pasta, all the cheese, pasta and then sauce.  This is the first time I had the layers ending with the cheese and then sauce of top, but it turned out very good and attractive.  Thanks for sharing this cheesy, yummy recipe.\n",

I then tried dredging the shrimp in flour, dipping in batter and frying and that worked much better.  Don't expect a thick coating of batter, these shrimp are light and crisp and very good.

      "0 It's the Jewish High Holiday season now, and you would think that I would have honey cake coming out of my ears by now, but this cake is so different from the honey cakes I usually make, so I had to try it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, I wanted the cake to be non-dairy, so I used margarine instead of butter and soy milk instead of regular milk.  The cake had a very nice texture to it, rich and very similar to basboosa, a Middle Eastern semolina cake.  I do think the lemon flavor was a little too overpowering, the honey and lemon taste reminded me a little of cough syrup.  I don't think 4 tablespoons of honey was enough to sweeten the cake, especially with a full lemon's worth of juice in there.  I'm going to try to make this again, this time upping the honey to about 1/3 of a cup and cutting back on the lemon juice (or use a much smaller lemon).  This is a good cake to serve at the end of a Middle Eastern style meal, with some Turkish coffee or sweet mint tea.  Thanks Vanessa!\n",

      "0 I subbed olive oil for the canola oil and great northern beans for the cannellinis and baby spinach for the kale, even though I bought kale specifically for this recipe!  (The baby spinach really needed to be used up, plus, I love it)  This was a great soup, however, I found it lacking a little in flavor.  I made it last night and I must say that after sitting overnight (I've got a bowl in-hand right now) the flavors have melded and gotten stronger, but it still seems to me that it is missing something.  I think next time I will definitely fry a couple slices of bacon to crumble and add and perhaps experiment with adding other spices than just oregano, salt and pepper.  Perhaps utilizing vegetable or chicken broth rather than just water would also provide a flavor boost.  A nice, hearty soup- good for a cool autumn night, that's for sure!  I used butternut squash, as well.  The taste of the squash was not overwhelming in the least- I even got my squash-hating boyfriend to eat a bowl!  (I'm determined to change his mind about squash!)

      "0 I like these cookies! The recipe was a little hard to follow, though. It would be nice if the ingredients were arranged in the order that they are used. The 1 tablespoon cinnamon listed with the cookie ingredients is not mentioned in the directions, and I decided not to put any in the dough, just use cinnamon in the topping. Whether this was correct or not I don't know. I made half of the recipe, and other than cinnamon, kept with the ingredients and the recipe's proportions. I used brandy, and think this was a good choice. I do not think that the same amount of brandy flavor or vanilla should be used as brandy, wine or water. It would be nice if a note to that effect could be inserted. The approximate diameter of the dough roll would be nice to know, too. I used slightly less than the full amount of flour, and the cookies spread rather more than I expected. But as I said, they are very tasty, and different. Thank you for the recipe.  \n",

I used a little dried pineapple instead of canned pineapple, but other than than didn't change any ingredients or proportions. Thank you for a nice recipe, Kasha  \n",

It's unusual to find a cake that uses ginger without combining it with other spices. It is as if you are learning a new flavor. One friend, who didn't know what was in the cake was saying, \"This is nice, but what's this flavor?\" It's almost elusive. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, Evelyn.\n",

I discovered after making these cupcakes that I am not very fond of the flavor of custard powder, which comes through quite strongly. I am sure there are other people who will find this flavor pleasant and enjoy the recipe. Thank you.  \n",
